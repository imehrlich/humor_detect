Well, I'll be damned...
I'll be damned.
I'll be damned.
Well, I'll be damned...
You're naked AND you bake?
We have an oven ???
Phew... when you said you had something in the oven, I thought you meant something else.
'When you said you had one in the oven that's not what I thought you meant."
How about them apples?
Wait -- what going away party?
I see you've found a loophole.
Mom's apple pie? What's a Mom?
God knows I shouldn't.
You mean I can have my pie and Eden too?
I think you've just invented the loophole.
What family recipe?
What do you mean 'to die for'?
Then again, it'd also be a sin to waste it.
Mom's apple pie? Who's mom?
God knows I really shouldn't.
Wait, we have an oven?
What's the worst that could happen?
Apple? Well I'll be damned!
Sure, I'll try it. What's the worst that could happen?
How much sin would some ice cream add?
I guess after this we'll start dressing for dinner.
Ooh, that looks sinful.
Could be a recipe for disaster...
An apple pie, well I'll be damned.
Ok I'll try it. What's the worst that can happen?
We have a kitchen?
This pie for another rib.
It smells delicious, but there'll be hell to pay later.
Apple pie? Well I'll be damned!
I think I may have found a loophole.
God knows I shouldn't.
An apple pie, well I'll be damned.
Well, how 'bout them apples.
That's some loophole.
Oooo. Mom's apple pie! ... Wait..Who's Mom?
What do you mean, you think you found a loophole?
What's the worst that could happen?
Apple pie? I'll be damned!
It'd be a sin to waste it.
Pie and a naked woman, I must have died and gone to Heaven.
What if we just ate the crust?
Like WHOSE mother used to make?
What do you mean by "It may contain traces of the forbidden fruit"?
Eve invents the loophole.
I'm not sure that's a valid loophole.
It's better than sex? What's sex?
God has desserted us?
It would also be a sin not to eat it
Mom's apple pie? What's a Mom?
I'm tempted.
Oh great. Original sin AND carbs!
Might as well make that to go
You're right...its a sin NOT to eat it.
Is that the original tin?
You sure this is a loophole?
Seems like a perfectly legal loophole to me.
Eve creates the first recipe for disaster.
Wait a minute, we have an oven?
Wait...we've had an oven this whole time?
I smell a loophole
Wow! You baked a loophole!
I really shouldn't---but what the hell.
A knife? I don't even have pants.
I smell trouble.
You think you found a loophole?
I don't think that's going to fool him...
It's forbidden fruit no matter how you slice it, Eve.
Whew! When you said you had one in the oven I thought...
What do you mean 'just like mom used to make?'
What's a loophole?
Oh no, the temptation of crust.
Eve, it's the "to die for" part that worries me.
I don't know, Eve... I think it still counts.
That's tempting.
A moment on the lips, a lifetime in the mortal abyss.
You baked me a delicious loophole?
That's original.
Mmm, apple pie!? Damned if I do, damned if I don't.
What do you mean, "This pie is to die for?"
Sure. What's the worst could happen?
I think I found a loophole.
I hope I don't regret this tomorrow.
Let's see now... Live together in paradise forever OR condemn humanity to unimaginable suffering. Hmmm... Is that a hand made crust?
Wait, we have an oven?
How could it be your mother's recipe?
What do you mean it's your mother's recipe?
And on the eighth day, man expected dinner.
"This is exactly why we'll need lawyers in the very near future".
What do you mean it's "to die for"?
Whew! That's not the "one in the oven" I thought you meant.
Your desserts are going to be my downfall.
To be clear, when you say 'it's to die for'...?
Come on, Eve, I wasn't born yesterday.
This could be our ticket out of here.
Maybe we should get that to go.
You have an oven?
You had to make it even more tempting, didn't you?
I guess it would also be a sin to let it get cold.
I'm confused. How can this be your mother's recipe?
Let's hope we've got him on a technicality.
I'm tempted.
No -- I mean you REALLY shouldn't have.
When you said 'something in oven,' I thought you meant . . . .
I didn't even know that we had an oven.
It's to die for!
We're in big trouble--any way you slice it.
Now we need clothes AND oven mitts.
It would be a sin not to try it.
Wait, has fire been discovered yet?
So the deal is I can either eat this, or I can continue to have you walk around naked?
Why do women make things so complicated?
I don't know, it sorta sounds like a recipe for disaster.
It's just like who's? What's a 'mom'?
On the day after this, God created oven mitts.
It's mom's apple pie? What's a mom?
Sure. What could go wrong?
You found a loophole?
Yikes ... When you said you had one in the oven ...
Wow, that's to die for!
Where did you find an oven?
Mom's apple pie? You don't have a Mom.
Well, he didn't say I couldn't have pie.....
Sure, what's the worst that could happen?
I think you've found a recipe for disaster!
No thanks, I want to look good naked.
Apple? Well I'll be damned!
You don't give up, do you?
We've invented fire?
I suspect we'll need it to-go.
Oh, so that's what you meant by 'loophole.'
Let me get this straight - if I eat this pie, I get to see that you're naked?
Ah - what the hell.
I'm thinking we can get by on a technicality.
What do you mean 'just like mom used to make?'
God forbid!
Your mom's recipe? Wait, what's a mom?
What's a loophole?
When you said "I have one in the oven" I was thinking of something else.
When were you going to tell me about the oven?
Pretty sure this is still going to count.
OK, now I'm tempted
Sinfully delicious, I suppose.
No, really, you shouldn't have.
I think I found a loophole.
When did you get an oven?
What do you mean " sinfully delicious"?
Pie, why not! What could go possibly go wrong?
What do you mean "mom's apple pie"
I think it's a recipe for disaster.
May contain traces of nuts and forbidden fruit
That looks tempting.
Are the apples local?
Don't tempt me.
The Origin of the Legal Loophole
If we're going to commit original sin, we might as well add vanilla ice cream.
We may have to eat this on the road.
Oh God ... I'm going to pay for this later!
Is this to make up for the rib?
Eh... a moment on your lips, eternity on your hips.
That looks sinful.
What part of forbidden didn't you understand?
Well, that looks positively sinful!
Eve, I hope you baked the hell out of it.
This could be a recipe for disaster!
It'd be a sin NOT to eat it.
You're right. He never mentioned pie.
I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess "apple."
I hope you baked the hell out of it
I'm not sure 'getting God on a technicality' is such a good idea.
Is this another half-baked idea from that serpent?
Wait! You have an oven ?
So the fruit is from the tree of alternative knowledge?
... and you're sure the forbidden fruit thing was fake news?
Skip fruitful. Let's multiply.
That voice you heard? Fake news.
Just like who used to make?
Oh my, that looks sinful.
Oy, now a whole pie?! You saw how He got over one flippin' apple.
Now THAT'S tempting
I can't keep up with all these Apple updates, Eve.
Wait, how can it be an "old family recipe?"
I'm guessing apple.
I hate these letter of the law-spirit of the law conundrums.
What family recipe?
Were those apples locally sourced?
I don't eat gluten.
Good looks, a hot body and you can cook, this must be paradise.
You're always one step ahead, aren't you
Wait—where did you find an oven?
Your mother's recipe? What's a 'mother'?
I know I'll regret this.
"Pie"? Sure, I'll try some, but is it to die for?
"Who is "Mom"?
Well I suppose one cheat day can't hurt. What's the worst that could happen?
Maybe we can get off on a technicality.
That looks sinful.
Just like who used to make?
Mom's apple pie?
I asked you to be more pious, not to make a pie for us.
um..Eve.. where did you find an oven?
Well, if we are going to be bad, let's be VERY bad.
There is a god.
No -- I mean you REALLY shouldn't have.
Where did you find a fork for the holes?
So, technically we're ok.
Have we always had an oven?
You had me at 'apple'.
Wow, that's super nice, but I think we're still going to blame everything on you.
Please tell me it's a chicken pot pie.
That's tempting.
And on the eighth day, Eve became the first person to ever read the Apple terms and conditions.
Whew! When you said you had one in the oven I thought...
What exactly do you mean 'sinfully good'?
Shouldn't we invent Mom and America first?
I have a feeling I'm gonna pay for this later.
You shouldn't have -- it was just a rib.
I can't resist a good loophole.
Is that from Hell's Kitchen?
Oh my, that looks positively sinful!
Adam's original sin was his inability to resist the offering of a tart.
Wait...when did we discover fire?
Technically, He didn't mention anything about pie
It is tempting.
It's an alternative fruit, you say?
It just might work. It gives us plausible denial.
Well that's tempting!
You sure 45 minutes at 350 kills all the sin?
To die for?
Thanks, but I've already Eden.
Now explain it to me again, exactly what is a guilty pleasure ?
I guess I'm just as damned if I don't?
Well ... he didn't say anything about pies.
Oh god. This is a trick question, isn't it?
What would happen if I just eat the crust?
What do you mean, it's from an old family recipe?
I guess you're right; I don't think He said anything about apple pie.
I'll start packing
Better than sex?
What do you mean "mom's apple pie"
We can't go to Hell for rhubarb, right?
This or run around naked forever....hmmmm
I think we have found the first loophole.
I don't think that's going to fool him...
That looks tempting.
I don't think using them in a pie counts as a loophole.
He didn't say anything about pie, right?
So the fruit is forbidden, but what if I just eat the crust?
We don't even have clothes. Where did you find an oven?
Tell me it's not apple.
Hmmm...it is tempting...
You sure know how to tempt a guy.
What do you mean it's your mom's recipe?
Am I going to regret this?
Forget the forbidden fruit. God taught you to bake?
Well, I'm sure of one thing. It's not your mother's recipe.
Looks tempting.
Maybe just a bite.
I'll never be able to fit into my leaf after eating this.
Brilliant idea to eat the evidence.
Gender roles already?
Any more pie, and I won't be able to squeeze into my fig leaf.
I guess you're right He didn't say "No forbidden fruit PIES."
You go ahead. I've Eden.
I'm not sure if this counts as a loophole.
That smells positively sinful!
Oh my God, Eve, that looks positively SINFUL!!
Smells sinful.
Well, He did say to be fruitful...
Oh my god....gosh....what a relief! When you said you had one in the oven....
Not what I was expecting when you said you have "something in the oven"
You shouldn't have. No, really -- you shouldn't have.
Well that's tempting!
Seemed a waste to throw the apple out after just one bite.
What would Jesus do?
Ooh, I'm tempted...
No, thank you. That was enough knowledge for one day.
Actually, no -- I don't think you've found a loophole.
Relax Adam... It's Peach Cobbler
Where'd you get an oven?
"Who is "Mom"?
How did you spot the legal loophole?
To die for?
When did you get an oven?
Well okay, if you're positive that you baked the Hell out of it.
No, I think technically it's still an apple.
First it's apple pie. The next thing I know, you'll be raising Cain.
You misunderstood when I said you need to be more pious.
You make falling from grace and eternal damnation so attractive
Locally sourced ingredients have always been my downfall.
I suppose a little slice couldn't hurt.
It can't possibly be your mother's recipe.
Am I going to catch hell for this?
Do you mind telling me who gave you the recipe?
You've taken sin to a whole new level
I think this makes for plausible deniability on our part.
Yeah, I think that still counts
Wait, how could it be your mother's recipe?
Ooh, it smells sinful.
No, I don't think you can "bake the hell" out of that apple.
You're really making this hard.
What do you mean "As good as Mom's apple pie?"
I have to admit it's tempting, Eve.
So if I admit to evolution I can have a slice?
That looks positively sinful!
I preferred it when you invented sex.
Smells tempting
Any way you slice it, I still think it's a bad idea.
The pie is tempting, but your outfit is amazing!
Wait. Where did you get an oven?
So, you're looking to get off on a technicality?
And you think he won't see through that?
Pie comes before the Fall
Fool me once, shame on you...
Please tell me that you're not trying to trick me into eating kale.
Damned if I eat this, damned if I don't.
What do you mean "sinfully good?"
You didn't need to do that. I don't even miss the rib.
This pie is to die for.
You really shouldn't have.
It's literally to die for.
Where did you find the pie tree?
'That looks really tempting.'
Oh my God, you shouldn't have.
I am not sure what you mean by "loophole". Just hand me a fork.
Who's Granny Smith?
Since when did we have an oven?
Should I dress for dinner?
How do you know that baking it makes it okay?
Always with the Forbidden Fruit. Just once I'd like a Lemon Meringue!
Since when did we get an oven?
Don't you think we're in enough trouble?
What do you mean, it's sinfully good?
Whaddaya mean, "Snake 'n bake"?
Eyes on the pie Adam, keep your eyes on the pie.
Oh God, that's tempting!
At least wear oven mitts
Honey, keep this up and pretty soon I won't be able to see my fig leaf.
I hope this isn't another one of your half baked ideas, Eve.
If He asks, tell Him it's peach.
You found apples? Well, I'll be damned!
How is this paradise if we can’t have pie?
Well, he never said s thing about pie...
Hell hath no oven mitts.
It's called Apple Pie. It's to die for.
When you say, "May contain apples..."
You bought an oven?
I'm guessing apple.
Somehow I get the impression we're still screwed.
And on the sixth day, God also created irony
Aren't we in enough trouble already?
I baked the hell out of it
Honestly I prefer your ribs.
Hell yes!
I get apple pie, but what is "mom"?
Well gluttony wasn't exactly the first sin I wanted to commit
What I really want is sex.
That's one way of disposing of the evidence.
This looks like a recipe for disaster...
Wait...this can't be your mom's apple pie.
When you said you had something in the oven, I was expecting a baby!
How can you say, it's your mother's recipe?
Tempting, but I probably shouldn't.
And you have one in the oven, you say?
How original!
What do you mean it's an old family recipe?
Tempting—but when did we get an oven?
I know it's a pie, is that the original tin?
That's not what I meant about being pious.
Now this is tempting.
Now THAT'S tempting
If we're going to do something wrong, let's do it right.
Yes, I was worried for a second when you said you had one in the oven.
When were you going to tell me about the oven?
Maybe its the pie, but suddenly you look very sexy.
I kinda think He's still going to notice.
Now THAT'S what I call temptation!
I found a loophole
Maybe just a bite.
Wrap it up and I'll start packing.
Now that's original!
What did the lawyer say?
"Let me guess, it's to die for".
When did he invent ovens?
Define sinful.
I think we will have to take that to go.
I thought you were making a devils food cake
Who the hell is Sara Lee?
The forbidden apples aren't the concern here. Where did you find an oven?
Oh, you shouldn't have.
Just a pinch of sin-namon.
Just promise me you cooked the hell out of them.
I don't think your loophole will be acceptable to Him.
You aren't making this easy.
Well that's original!
So... You did what with the apple?
No clothes, but an oven?
Oh, that looks absolutely sinful!
You know, you'd think in Paradise it wouldn't always have to be, "Damned if you do and damned if you don't."
Milk from the forbidden cow would go great with this.
Ok, so it was from the tree of fake knowledge?
No, it smells like a technicality.
Why not? Let's make Paradise great again!
You've got fire?
I can't. I'm doing this Paleo thing.
The pie is nice but I'm more interested in your buns.
It looks tempting, but then again, what do I know?
You're sure that loophole will work?
I'm concerned it violates the spirit of the agreement.
God only knows where this came from!
But I thought we were having ribs.
Is it okay if I just eat the crust?
On this day, man learned to never eat hot food naked
I think you misunderstood "piety."
Apple, again?
Eve, you shouldn't have. No, I mean it, you shouldn't have.
It looks delicious, but are you sure it's guilt-free?
You're sure it's kosher?
A family recipe? What's a family?
The snake wanted to welcome us to the neighborhood.
Shouldn't we get dressed first?
I thought you were going to make the Devil's food cake...
Do I smell sinnamon?
The downside is we may have to eat and run.
Come to think of it, He never did say anything about pie.
How on God's green earth did you do that?
Wow! That looks to die for!
Smells like trouble!
We'll regret this in the morning.
So I get both pie and sex?
As if I wasn't already tempted.
Maybe it came from the tree of Alternative Knowledge?
Wow? Where do you find an oven?
I don't see this ending well.
What do you mean, your mother's recipe?
Very tempting.
Are you sure this doesn't count?
It's not the calories I'm worried about.
I know where you got the apples, but the oven?
The way to a man's rib is through his stomach.
She was warned. Nevertheless, she persisted.
'Mom's Apple Pie'? But we don't have a Mom.
Fool me once...
It's humble pie... what's the worst that could happen?
Hmm ... who would I rather have mad at me for eternity?
Looks sinful.
God may forgive us. Our thighs will not.
"Oh jeez, was that 'be fruitful and multiply' or 'be fruitful and multi-pie'?
Now THAT'S what I call temptation!
I have to admit it is tempting.
Wait a minute—like WHOSE mother used to make?
But I don't have a birthday.
I really shouldn't...
What's the catch?
I don't feel like I explained this very well .
It's to die for!
And your father is OK with this?
Well, he didn't say pie.
Tempting, isn't it?
Smells heavenly
I don't know about the letter, but this might violate the spirit of the law.
Let's get this over with so we can finally put on some clothes.
It does look tempting.
They say your apple pie is to die for
Wow! Eve only gave me an apple.
And I’ll offer you ribs.
And who pray tell is Granny Smith?
Hmmm. Tempting.
I'm not sure that this changes the theological implications.
I'll bite...
What do you mean, "Mom's famous recipe?"
How about I just eat the crust?"
Mmm, smells like the fall.
I just know I'm going to feel self conscious about my body after eating this.
Honey, you shouldn't have.
Wow, just like mom used to... wait!
Where the hell did you bake that?
You get knowledge. I get a pie. I like where this is going.
That looks more appealing than your devils food cake.
Don't worry, the snake says it will make us great again!
The devil is in the details.
Only if it's kosher.
Thanks, but you had me at the tiny fig leaf.
Are you ribbing me?
Looks positively sinful.
Wasting it would be a sin, right?
I think it's still forbidden.
Pie goeth before the fall.
You're getting ahead of the story.
What do you mean "granny" Smith?
Nevertheless, she persisted.
And you cook too...this is awesome!
Don't tempt me.
Well, I guess one bite won't hurt.
Is this some kind of workaround?
Your mom's recipe?
Ooh, that looks sinful.
Wait—where did you find an oven?
So you're saying it's an alternative apple, and not really an apple?
I see you've upped the ante.
Oh, it is tempting, but I am watching my fate.
Sinfully delicious, you say?
..and from that moment on man loved woman.
What do you mean, 'Let's put the sin in cinnamon?'
On second thought, I'd rather not know.
This is why I have trust issues
If we're going to be banished, we might as well indulge.
It's not a pie; it's a loophole.
Where'd you get an oven?
When did you invent the oven?
Did you say this is your Grandma's recipe?
Tell me it's blueberry.
What do you mean it's your grandmother's recipe?
Well, I'll be damned, but I want a bite.
You devil you.
Please say it's not apple.
What do you mean "Hell's Kitchen?"
Immaculate Convection
Maybe later. Just ate an apple.
FUCK YOU COCKSUCKERS AND ALL YOUR ANTI-TRUMP BULLSHIT. YOU ARE FUCKING ASSHOLES. DO YOUR OWN JUDGING. THAT'S WHAT YOU GET PAID FOR, LAZY FUCK BRAIN. I WANT NO PART OF YOUR CHEAP FUCKING SHITTY MAGAZINE CRAP. TRUMP IS YOUR PRESIDENT. DEAL WITH IT.
"Wait... Now, I'm Adam... And you're Eve... Who's Granny Smith?
Let there be loopholes
Sinful in a good way, though, right?
Oh, that looks absolutely sinful!
This changes everything.
OK. This just got tough.
Three questions: Who are you? Where's my rib? Is that apple?
Well I guess there's always room for pie.
I'm trying to remember exactly what we were told.
Garden of Eatin'
I'm not sure this is what God had in mind when he said our sins would lead to just deserts.
It does look positively sinful
Good thing I saved my appetite by not eating that apple.
Such a tart.
It's not so much the sin I'm worried about--it's the gluten.
I'm not sure apple was the best choice.
Wow, you really want to move don't you?
I'm not even going to ask what you did to get an oven!
Darling, that smells positively sinful!
Wait, who's coming over?
I see you've taken this forbidden fruit thing to the next level
I guess one bite can't hurt anything.
You baked it? Now we'll really catch hell!
Smells tempting, but it'll go straight to my conscience.
You really think he's not going to notice?
Adam and Sarah Lee, the real story.
Thank God . I thought you were going to make me eat one of those apples
No, no, the pie looks good. I was just looking for my rib?
Sure, we'll be doomed to an eternity of doubt and existential anguish, but... pie.
This might be worth it.
Is this what you meant by "going all the way."
It isn't the sin that concerns me so much as the gluten.
Better make it to go.
No, really, you shouldn't have.
It does add a new twist to the story.
It is tempting.
When life gives you apples...
You really know how to push His buttons.
I'm not sure that eliminates the original sin problem.
I'm really trying to be good this week.
Where did you find an oven?
Uh, I had something else warm and sweet in mind.
Eve, you gotta let it go.
Well, I guess when life gives you apples...
You sure it's just a metaphor?
My God! You found an oven!
I'm not going to fall for that.
It would be a bigger sin to let an apple pie go to waste?
Well, if the snake said it's okay, I suppose it's okay.
I really shouldn't but it'd be a sin not to eat it.
Just like Mom's? Oh wait...
It smells really good, but something about it just doesn't seem kosher.
Did you bake the hell out of it?
Eve, does this mean we must dress for dinner?
I don't know, 'The Fruit of Eternal Damnation' sounds tempting, but can we just go back to 'Death by Chocolate?'
Wow, looks sinful...whatever that means!
apples to apples... crust to crust...
That's not the temptation I expected.
Somehow, this still feels wrong.
Tart.
Are you sure He designated the 7th day as "Cheat Day?"
Actually, I'm Steve.
Any chance that's cherry?
Well this is a first.
Good try! But that just not what's on my mind at the moment.
Apple or cherry? It matters.
Yah, it smells good but it will surely taste like hell.
This smells like entrapment.
Tell me it's not apple.
Aw, you shouldn't have. REALLY, you shouldn't have.
Smells sinful.
This takes temptation to a whole new level
Wow, I'd like a piece of that.
I can't remember what God said not to eat, but it sure wasn't pie!
God only knows how you baked that pie!
It would be a sin not to eat that.
...As long as it isn't apple...
Next week on "Naked and Afraid"
I don't understand, what do you mean it's your mother's recipe?
I think it still counts.
That looks sinfully good.
Looks tempting.
Does it count if i just smell it?
Sinfully delicious, you say?
Well, I can't say Mom's was better.
You shouldn't have. No, really -- you shouldn't have.
I was thinking you should have the first bite.
She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.
You cook, too?
Well, it does look sinful.
Are the apples locally sourced?
Sorry Eve, it's just not that tempting.
I'm guessing it's apple.
Let me guess: apple.
It would be even more tempting with vanilla ice cream.
God hath forbid eating of ... wait a minute ... is that a caramel streusel topping I smell?
"Your MOM'S apple pie?! I don't get it.
But sweets are my downfall.
Alternate fact bible story #1
My favorite - forbidden fruit pie!
Well, I guess He didn't specifically mention pie...
A fair trade for a prime rib.
Will another rib get me ice cream?
Of course I will try the pie, what is the worst that could happen.
I think it's too late for humble pie.
Really? Cooking makes it okay?
Peach, right?
Smells Original.
Well if we're going to hell anyway...
That wasn't exactly what I was thinking of when I told you I wanted a piece.
Apple pie? You bet your asp I'll eat it!
What do you mean, your mother's recipe?
I don't think He'll consider baking the apples in a pie a loophole.
Forget the fruit, how did you find an oven out here?
Where did you get the oven?
That looks good ... not that I would know.
What do you mean, 'It's just like Mom used to make'?
You can bake?
That better be strawberry rhubarb.
It's wicked good.
Ah, nice try.
I don't know if it's a sin or not, but it sure is original !
You were suppose to FORSAKE it, not BAKE it.
Alternative fact: We didn't eat the apple; we ate apple pie.
So, I guess we're moving?
No need for subterfuge. It's an allegory.
I gave my left rib and that's all the thanks I get?
I'd rather have my rib back.
It's just passion fruit.
Are you trying to seduce me?
No, now I think we are just compounding the problem.
I think you're supposed to take the first bite.
Yah right, you must think I was born yesterday.
I'm pretty sure that still counts.
Should I dress for dinner?
Rhubarb? Thank God!
Wait. I still don't understand. Where did the oven come from?
Okay, maybe not the letter but are you sure this doesn't violate the spirit?
That smells sinfully good.
How about you go first this time?
Any way you slice it, this seems wrong.
You know I can't resist temptation!
Still not tempted. Maybe a flan?
I understand your pies are to die for.
Let me tell you that one rib is really paying dividends
Apple pie kinda reminds me of Fall
No, no, no... The apple is just an allegory for sex.
Mom's apple pie?
" hmmmm... tempting , really tempting ".
Wow! That smells amaz--Oh, my God, we're naked!
Promise me you'll never wear an apron.
Smells divine!
Well no, He didn't say anything about apple pie per se.
I love the smell of original cinnamon.
An old family recipe? Really?
Look, Adam! It's new from "Snake and Bake"!
I call this flavor Adam's Apple
I'm more of a fig man myself.
We"ll beat him on a technicality.
Honey, you shouldn't have.
Where is the oven ?
The origin of gender stereotypes
Yeast of Eden.
So if they're cooked, they're ok to eat?
Awesome. I didn't even know you got the oven fixed.
I really shouldn't...
You're very persistent, I'll give you that.
It looks so good it's sinful.
Is it really the original sin if you just copied the recipe?
Technically that is no longer a fruit, right?
Where did you get the oven?
'Grandmother's recipe?' What's a grandmother?
mmmmm , that looks downright sinful
When did you have time to invent the oven?
So I see you've decided to go for the nuclear option.
Sure you can tempt me with dessert.
Umm, yeah... I just don't think He'll appreciate the distinction.
Just like Mom used to make. . .oh wait."
Who gave you the recipe?
Locally sourced?
Are you sure this doesn't violate the spirit of the law?
Eve, I swear. Your desserts are just absolutely sinful!
And after all that, you went with cherry?
He said we could have our pie and eat it too? What could go wrong?
I'm guessing it's apple.
I don't think discovering the first loophole will change his mind.
I'm thinking cherry might have been a better choice.
He'll know, he'll know!
Is this an original recipe?
Gee, I don't remember any mention of pie, do you?
The Holy Bible: Alternative Facts Edition
Thank God! I thought you said you had a BUN in the oven.
Why is it called Paradise Lost Pie?
Eat the apple pie and I get to see you naked? What's the catch?
I hope this doesn't get us evicted.
What a Godsend
If it looks like an apple, smells like an apple, and tastes like an apple, it's still an apple, Eve.
Do you remember whether it is only apples or all apple products that are forbidden?
Tempting.........
... well I guess God didn't say anything about rhubarb
Can I eat just the crust?
Calm down; it's blueberry.
I thought we agreed on a completely sin free diet.
It's even more tempting than I expected.
We don't have an oven.
You're reinforcing gender stereotypes that don't even exist yet!
Very tempting Eve.
You really think it will make Eden great again?
No, no. You can have the first bite.
Religious and moral implications aside, I'm impressed that you found a way to bake it.
I'll give you one thing, Eve. You are persistent.
You're sure He's okay with this?
Let me think this time.
So...what's the bad news?
Ok, yes, I do like them apples.
"You've taken temptation to a new level'
It looks good, but is it sinfully good?
When I said I wanted to 'eat your pie'...
Is that the "original thin" crust?
What did you do with the apple?
You had me with just an apple.
When did you have time to invent the oven?
Is that the original recipe?
How can it be your grandma's recipe? You don't have a grandma!
God knows I can't say no to apple pie!
Are we out of ribs?
I'll be damned, is this apple pie?!
Oh Eve that's what you meant when you said " You have something in the oven. "?
If that's apple, we're in trouble.
It would be a sin to let it go cold.
Looks sinfully delicious. The pie looks good too.
You pulled that from the forbidden oven, didn't you?
Lord knows, you're not making this any easier!
First ribs, and now apple pie?
Would it kill you to try something new?
So let me get this straight . . . baking the fruit for 45 minutes at 425 degrees takes all the forbidden out of it?
Wow Eve, you're really putting all this knowledge stuff to good use!
Stop making this harder than it is.
Only one way to find out...
I dunno. Mind if I check the rules again?
Let me guess.
Don't tell me what's in it. I want to be surprised.
Well, Sunday is my cheat day.
Ooh, I'm tempted...
Aren't we getting a little bit ahead of ourselves?
Soul food?
No, I'm certain he said "cursed", not "crust".
No, no. I said, 'you're the apple of my eye!
Blueberry? Great, we get to stay!
Well, this is escalating quickly.
Fool me once...
Well, I guess you're right. He didn't tell us not to eat pie.
Thanks, but I really shouldn't.
So it's okay if it's cooked?
It's lovely, darling, but pie are square!
Not tonight. I have a headache.
Are the apples locally sourced?
Good and evil I get, but how did you know we had an oven?
It's Adam's apple pie!
Is this pie forbidden-fruit free?
He is watching what I eat.
One Slice won't kill me. Right?
Is it organic?
Well this certainly looks tempting!
If we eat this I'm afraid you'll raise Cain.
Let me guess, apple again?
Taste this and tell me know if it's good or evil.
When I said I would sell my soul for an apple pie, I meant it figuratively.
Mmm, looks sinful.
Wow, thanks. I only said you had a cute asp.
It doesn't count if it's cooked, right?
Maybe give the apple thing a rest.
But how could that possibly be your grandmother's recipe...?
Is this the day that I die?
OK, you win.
It's just a pie, what could go wrong?
Aw, you shouldn't have...no, seriously, you shouldn't have...
Your mother's recipe? How's that again?
As long as it's a pie it can't be a sin, right?
I guess I can't say it's as good as Mom's....
Do you think we'll get away with it?
Is it guilt-free?
Technically, I think that still counts.
Tempting, but I'd rather have ribs.
You really should ask HIM for a pair of oven mitts
...you invented pie!
This can't be paradise, I wanted peach cobbler.
"Try it! It's to die for".
A bite of your apple pie? Sure, what could go wrong?
Nice, but I like your buns better
I really shouldn't. One slice and it all goes right to my mortality.
You think He won't know what's inside?
He didn't forbid loopholes.
You really shouldn't have.
I do not think it will make Him change His mind.
Did you make it from scratch?
What tree did you pick that pie from?
That's original.
You know that doesn't change anything, right?
What's that you say? Mom's apple pie? I don't think so.
I hope it's guilt free.
Do I smell original cinnamon?
What do you mean He hasn't created ice cream yet?
Eve, the pie looks absolutely sinful!
Funny, it doesn't smell like strawberry rhubarb.
Are you sure He said Garden of Eatin'?
Wow! Look at those apples.
No! It's totally cool!! I found a damnation free recipe on Pinterest!
Wow, just like mom used to... wait!
Well, He didn't say anything about forbidden PIE...
But I don't have a mother.
What do you mean it's your mother's recipe?
I was looking everywhere for that apple.
Do I smell original cinnamon?
For some reason, I'm feeling very....American
I was wondering what happened to the apple.
I'm going to regret this.
Add a scoop of ice cream and I'm in.
I know where you got the apples...but where did you get the sugar, butter, eggs, and flour?!?
I suppose now I'll have to name this too.
Well ... he didn't say anything about pies.
You invented fire on your own, just for me?
Please tell me that’s a chicken pot pie.
Again with the apples?
It's mostly sinful because of the four sticks of butter.
Well, I'm not sure what you mean by 'sinfully delicious', but it sure smells yummy.
She was warned. Nevertheless, she persisted.
This looks great, Honey, but I really had my heart set on your devil's food cake.
'Guiltless' apple pie, you say?
Can we take it to go?
Well, I guess one little slice won't hurt.
I think as long as we don't eat it, we're OK.
Finally, something other than ribs!
What do you mean that it's as good as my mother's? What's a mother?
Don't make this more complicated than it already is.
Let's skip the apple pie and go straight to working on motherhood.
Will this make us refugees or expatriates?
That looks positively sinful!
I thought we were eating out.
What's a window sill ?
We'll be banished and have diabetes.
Okay, but just a sliver. I'm going to have to fit into a fig leaf tomorrow.
On which day did He create ovens again??
Uuuh... I still think that counts as forbidden.
NOT forbidden fruit pie again!
…and you’re naked.
Your mom's recipe?
Wow, is that homemade?
Are you positive apple pie doesn't count?
A Birthday Pie?!?!?! I'm glad I wore my birthday suit.
Wait, just like my who used to make?
This will definitely stick to my missing rib.
Since I am about to incur God's terrible wrath, could you make it a la mode.
I feel like this is a trap.
I wanna say apple, but melons are on my mind.
Did you remember to turn off the oven?
What a surprise! I haven't seen you since the fall.
Maybe just a slice, I'm watching my knowledge.
Mock apple pie, I hope.
I don't fear punishment from God, I fear love handles.
At least when we get kicked out, we’ll have a solid business model
I think, calories will be the least of our worries...
so you say the secret ingredient will improve my cognitive function?
Who taught you to bake?!
Thanks, but I'm more of a rib guy.
The origin of half-baked knowledge
This is a bad idea, isn't it?
What do you mean when you say"they" only had apple pie?
Taste this and tell me if it's good or evil.
Well...today is my cheat day.
Nevertheless, she persisted.
Maybe just a tiny piece.
Let me get this straight... I get to eat the pie AND realize we are both naked?
Are you sure plausible deniability will work ?
I really hope that's pumpkin.
Better wrap it to go.
MMM...that apple pie is to DIE for!
Home made sin? My favorite!
Well, 'sinfully sweet' does sound better than 'forbidden.'
I think He meant pies too
Your grandma's recipe? What's a grandma?
Yeah, I think that still counts
Is that a cover-up?
We may need a legal interpretation on this.
I just don't think it's a viable workaround.
I, uh, of course I remembered it's our anniversary!
Look, he's omniscient. He's gonna figure it out.
I forgot our anniversary again, didn't I.
Any forbidden dairy to go with that?
You say it's made with alternative fruits?
You know you had me at the apple.
And on the nineteenth day, God finally bought us a stove.
But first you made an oven?
You have an oven?
I am concerned about just desserts.
But how can it be your mother's recipe?
Maybe we should stick to lower-hanging fruit.
You first, Eve.
Thanks. But if this is Paradise, where's the vanilla ice cream?
Oh, darling. You shouldn't have.
I still can't figure out how you got the recipe.
Is there any ice cream, or is that, "forbidden" too?
I might be naked, but I'm not that easy.
Wait. What day does he invent ice cream?
Please tell me that's cherry.
Actually, I'm more concerned about the gluten.
On second thought, better make that To Go.
I usually regret dessert.
I think he meant it as more of a metaphor.
Are you SURE baking takes the sin out of apples?
I don't remember HIM saying anything about pie.
And do I smell a hint of original cinnamon?
But it smells like apple pie.
Shouldn't we just stick with pepperoni pizza like He told us?
I sure hope that's peach.
Should we take it to go?
Now I feel guilty no matter what I do.
I hope the apples were locally sourced.
That's not what I thought you meant by, "Hey, I have one in the oven."
I am fine with the sin, but not the gluten.
Does it still count if they're cooked?
Um, I guess that makes it okay...
So the pie is a metaphor?
You have really evolved!
We're so outta here.
Nice try, but I don't think baking it into a pie is gonna get us out of this one.
Well, when you put it that way...
"You were warned. You were given an explanation. Yet, you persisted".
Whoa! Back up a little. First of all, what's an "oven?"
I'm more of a cake man
But we don't have an oven
I'm sensing the eve of destruction.
Being a strict constructionist, I don't believe He said anything about pies.
That doesn't smell like blueberry ...
Well, let's hope there's a pie exception to this whole 'forbidden fruit' thing.
That certainly looks tempting...
They didn't have cherry?
That smells sinful.
How do you like them apples?
He didn't say anything about pie.
If it were just forbidden fruit and not all that gluten, I'd definitely go for it.
Let me guess. You used the original cinnamon.
Are all the ingredients locally-sourced?
I'm pretty sure this violates apple's terms and conditions.
Oh, God! Please tell me it's blueberry!
Oh, I'll eat it all right, but just where have you been keeping it warm?
I don't think baking it into a pie will change his mind.
It took me 3.14 hours to make this. Now, what shall we call it?
Well, strictly speaking, it no longer is 'an apple', is it?
Wouldn't this occasion call for devils food cake ?
What Sin It?
First ribs, now pie?!
Eating your apple pie could get us deported.
Okay, so... a talking snake assured you this is gluten-free?
When you said I could get some of your forbidden pie, I misunderstood.
Ooooh, that smells sinful!
It's tempting, but I really shouldn't.
Smells sinfully good!
Is this an alternative truth?
Maybe if we just eat the crust?
No way that came from apples, next you'll tell me that we came from monkeys.
Apple pie served by a spare rib! What did I do to deserve this?
Oh no, did I forget our anniversary?
Trust me, it'll be okay. He didn't say apple PIE.
If we are going to get kicked out over this, we should at least do a la mode.
Why do women make everything so complicated?
It does look tempting.
The serpent doesn't give up, does it?
Well, technically it is my cheat day...
Don't tell me. Apple?
As American as Original Sin.
It's tempting, but I think it still counts.
But maybe He doesn't want me to understand women?
Ribs AND pie? Talk about sinful!
'Mom's apple pie'? I'm so confused.
Well, I guess he didn't say anything about rhubarb.
He never said anything about a forbidden pie...
And on the fifteenth day, God created oven mitts.
Well, yes, I suppose I could be tempted with dessert.
Eve, sweetheart, no more advice from the snake.
I don't know--I think I'd rather have ribs.
Aren't we moving a little fast?
I wanted ribs. I haven't had them in a while.
And on the seventh day God made an oven.
Relax...it's cherry.
Let me get this straight, I'm going to lose my immortal soul ... and I'm going to gain weight?
Apple pie! How original. And sinful.
I don't suppose a slice of apple pie could hurt.
I'd love to eat your pie. Now what's that you're holding?
My heart says no but my loins say yes.
Eve's first piece of knowledge: The way to a man's heart.
How original of you. That looks sinfully good!
Tempting, but I'll have hell to pay tomorrow.
Wait a minute, we don't have fire yet. What's going on here!
Please tell me it's locally sourced.
Mom, who?
I don't know. It still feels wrong.
Sorry, I can't. I'm on the paleo diet.
Quiche?
I'd love a slice, but it will be the fall of me.
Fuck it.
Original sin - all American style.
Hey, you got the oven fixed!
No thanks, I'll just have an apple.
No pie for me, thanks, but your melons look tempting.
And you're certain the recipe said 'Guilt-Free Apple Pie?'
Okay—now you're just being mean.
You can cook too?
So, guilty pleasure is a good thing?
That rib was so worth it.
You say, "It's sinful," like that's a good thing.
Trust me - baking it at 425 takes the original sin out.
Spare ribs and apple pie?
Fine-but this doesn't make up for the rib.
I prefer eternal damnation à la mode.
What's a mom? What's a recipe?
Pie. Do I even like pie?
It is my cheat day.
That's weird; I suddenly feel like eating a hot dog and watching a baseball game.
I don't know how you did that, but it looks like one hell of a temptation.
Mmm ... do I smell original cinnamon?
But Eve, don't you remember God forbade us to eat gluten?
What does he mean "sinfully delicious"?
I'm on a diet, but what the hell...
I'm thinking with my snake again.
Where the hell did that come from?
I may never look at you the same after this.
None of my other ribs give me this kind of trouble.
You made cherry, right?
...with one apple?
Honey...what did you do with my four and twenty blackbirds.....?
Oh God, this isn't going to end well.
But our Lord God says......wait a minute, did you say there's vanilla ice cream with that?
You really think we won't get in trouble if it's baked?
And in the beginning, God created male and female. And the male said, "I want a piece of that".
Apple sin-omen?
Adam and Eve get baked
Is that homemade?
Any way you slice it Eve, no dessert is guilt free
I’m not saying you cheated on me. I’m saying we don’t have an oven.
This is really messing with the script.
I'm sure it's fine. I'm still a little woozy from the rib.
Honey, that apple pie smells sinful.
I find it hard to believe that is better than sex.
To complement your spare rib?
O my God, it's Genesis 3:1416
Madam, I'm . . . damn!
You're rocking the hell out of this backwoods survivor thing!
I guess it's okay, he didn't say anything about pie.
No, I've never eaten this before. Any side effects?
This version of the story will be more believable.
Well, maybe this is a technicality that He can live with.
Whoa, apple. It's like you read my mind.
what else you got in the oven, eve?
Where on earth did you learn to bake?
Great, you got the oven working again.
For our sake, I hope that's pumpkin.
Oh no! Now I'm going to have to wear that damn fig leaf!
I'm not ready for that kind of commitment
I baked it with my own free will
...well, okay, but it's a sin without ice cream.
Well, technically....
Oh, God, no! Not another temptation!
I thought Forbidden Fruit was a metaphor.
I'll have a slice with a side of eternal damnation.
What's this "Old Family Recipe" thing?
Honey, Are you sure it's Kosher?
Do you really expect to tempt me into sin without a scoop of ice cream?
You cooked the sin out of it?
An old family recipe?
As long as the apples were locally sourced, I don't see a problem.
Smells good, but I have a bad feeling about this...
OMG, you didn't!!!
Honey, before we eat the pie of forbidden fruit, could you go get some forbidden vanilla ice cream?
Original sinfully delicious
Eve, please tell me you didn't use the apple !
I say it's cherry pie, and I say the hell with it.
There's at least a 3.14 percent chance this is a trick.
Uh, when I asked God for a tart that's not exactly what I had in mind.
Not quite what I was thinking when you asked if I wanted your Forbidden Pie.
One small slice for man, one giant leap backward for mankind.
I prefer peach but what the hell.
Now why don't we give the damn snake a bite and see what happens.
I thought you told the snake this would be a piece of cake?
And all I gave you was a rib...
Really, I shouldn't.
Yeah, I'm thinking that's still forbidden.
Make it a la mode and you've got yourself a deal.
Can you certify that pie contains no Tree of Knowledge ingredients and or by products?
Oh, great! No oven mitts?
Oh God, I really hope that's pecan.
It's definitely American but that doesn't mean it's right.
I was expecting a different Apple product.
You're sure He just meant if they were raw?
what's an oven?
I don't know, Eve. It's still APPLES.
The Garden of Eatin'
Just time for one bite, then I'm outta here.
Now that's original!
Gosh, Eve, that looks almost SINFUL!
Let's call it 3.14159...
Did you see an ice-cream tree around here?
Eve, is this apple? We talked about this.
Alternative fact. Did not eat an apple just a pie. Fake News ! So Sad!
Well, I don't think God said anything about BAKED apples.
We're over-thinking this whole thing.
You devil, I bet its apple pie.
Is it sin-free?
Maybe later if I'm not too tired. My boss wants me to name like a million animals.
Hold on now. At some point this becomes entrapment.
Oh geez....tell me you used the cherries.
You say this was your mother's recipe?
Babe, you put the "sin" in cinnamon apple!
So we were out of figs?
You baked it for the hell of it?
Man, he's really trying to get us to eat these apples.
So the snake taught you how to bake an apple pie?
Ah. One of my favorite guilty pleasures.
The crust is to die for.
What does "sinfully delicious" mean?
Here, Adam, this is pie to die for.
I'm not a dessert person, but what the heck.
What did He say about baked?
Really? Your mom's recipe?
Eve! Did you just invent the oven?
Is this one of those Apple upgrades?
Let me guess: apple.
Is it forbidden free?
Technically it IS no longer an apple.
One bite can't hurt.
For me? You shouldn't have!
It's tempting. And it looks good, but what do I know?
Please tell me that's rhubarb.
Apple pie a la nude?
I think you misunderstood. It's not the Garden of Eatin'.
If we're gonna get kicked out of the garden for this, I'm gonna want some ice cream to go with it.
It's the 'locally sourced' part I'm concerned about.
You think you found an apple loophole?
God only knows what's in that pie.
Oh no! Not apple!
I hope you used the unforbidden apples.
Thank God, this Paleo diet was killing me.
I think the snake's lying. Let's eat.
I think it was "dust shalt thou eat all the rest of thy life." You heard "crust"?
When Satan hands you apples, you make apple pie.
Is it Kosher ?
Forbidden fruit pie! That's my all-time favorite!
What fresh-baked hell is this?
You don't take no for an answer,do you?
Does it make a difference if it's in a pie?
It's tempting, but I thought we'd agreed to go paleo.
What kind? Sounds sinful.
Wait, are we Americans?
I said I wanted a Tie for my birthday!
Yes, an apple pie might be considered an alternative fact.
Are you sure He said, "Just dessert"?
There was something about apples, but seeing you like that I just can't think straight.
He said, "Eat apple - die" not "Eat apple pie"!
Golly, Eve, that's what mom would have baked if I had a mom.
Well, this certainly ups the ante...
Dessert for breakfast?! This really IS paradise!
That's a first.
Is this a trick?
Just one little slice couldn't hurt...could it?
Thank God it's not devil's food cake.
That's really tempting, but I could really use some ribs.
You had me at ‘you’ll get to wear pants’.
Are the apples local?
Where'd the apple go?
That's one hell of a pie.
Is that a gift from Hell's Kitchen?
I baked the sin out of it!
I shouldn't, I really really shouldn't ... It's just so tempting ... Maybe one bite, what could happen?
Do you think we'll get away with this cover-up?
And it's apple free?
I hope that is blueberry.
Does it taste as sinful as it looks?
I was expecting ribs tonight.
If that's apple I'm out of here
Wow! That looks sinfully delicious!
It's forbidden free
Seriously? Hide the apple in a pie trick again?....
Apple pie? we’ll be DEPORTED for sure.
We're not breaking the rules, just bending them.
If I eat that I'm going to have to wear some clothes.
It certainly is tempting.
I'd die for a slice.
So you're sure God isn't watching?
Where did you find the apples?
Are you sure it's kosher?
I didn't fall for the apple, so there's no way I'm going to try the pie.
Oh, God! I forgot it was our birthday.
Well, it does look sinfully delicious...
Funny, it doesn't smell like peach pie.
So that's what you meant when you said you had one in the oven
Now that's sinful!
I don't know, is it apple ?
Whoa! I'm tempted to try it!
Who's "Betty Crocker"? There's only the two of us...
I think I'm feelin' more like ribs.
He didn't say anything about apple pie.
I'll call our lawyer, but I still think we're in trouble.
Well, cherry IS tempting, but I'm more of an apple man myself.
Hot damn.
He didn't say anything about pie.
Jesus, hot apple pie? Satan's really upped his game ...
The snake suggested "Ala Mode".
It's not the apples I'm worried about. It's more the gluten.
Don't take this the wrong way, but I'm going to need my own lawyer.
Ha! Let's see Darwin explain this!
Why do you ask if I can keep a secret?
You sure there's no apples in it?
That looks sinfully delicious!
Well okay, today's my cheat day.
True, He technically didn't say no pies.
"Will you be serving our downfall a'la mode?
I don't think the story will read the same.
Cherry? Peach? Blueberry? Sorry, I give up.
You baked? That's a first.
I don't think a flaky crust makes it any less forbidden.
Now we're really cooked.
I'd be tempted if it were A La Mode.
I don't think baking it makes it any less "forbidden."
Apple pie is forbidden, let's just have sex :)
Ah Eve, you shouldn't have.
Well . . . when life gives you apples . . .
I have it, my first idea ....oven mitts...I was thinking underwear, but it's defiantly oven mitts...
I think you're missing the point. It's not about me disliking your baking.
What Sin It?
Honey, that looks sinful!
Don't tell me. Apple?
You will do anything to make me eat that apple
Please tell me that's pecan!
Sorry, Eve, but without ice cream, I just don't find it all that tempting
We can tell Him we used alternate apples.
Why apple? I was fine with pumpkin.
Is that the original tin?
Honey, you know pie is my biggest downfall.
I didn't realize ovens had been invented.
Don't worry, rules don't apply if it's baked.
When I gave up a rib, I was hoping for more than pie...
There's a Pie of Knowledge?
That's soooo tempting.
I bet it's absolutely sinful.
Oh, you are so wicked!
Where did you find the recipe?
I prefer devil's food cake.
I guessed the news about the apple was fake.
So the fruit of the tree of knowledge is bad, but the pie of the fruit of the tree of knowledge is okay?
I'm actually on the Paleo diet right now.
Oh my God! Please say that's cherry!
Mmm, looks sinful.
I don't know what you call that, Eve, but it smells tempting.
I don't know if that's really going to smooth things over with Him.
I don't remember him saying pie was a problem...
I thought we're supposed to smoke a cigarette
I thought you said you had a bun in the oven.
I'll eat anything as long as it isn't ribs.
I don't know, it seems half baked
Well, there are other ways to a man's heart, and where did you even find an oven, and a pie pan?
Any forbidden ingredients that I should be aware of?
Fig pie, my favorite but you did save the leaves, right?
Initiate the downfall of man AND go over my carbs limit . . . oooh, I don't know.
It's only a technicality, but maybe it can work.
Nice peace offering, but I think He's still pretty ticked about that first one.
On the 4,543,000,013th day, God said to Adam, "“From anything gluten free you may eat freely; but from the pie of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die from diabetes, cancer, and obesity.”
Jesus Eve...yeah, that still counts
And on the eighth day God created euphemisms
It's apple sin-namon.
Well, he didn't say anything about apple pie!
Out of 10, I'd give it a 3.1416.
Well that certainly is original
You always know how to tempt me.
Wow! You learned to make that from the tree of knowledge? How about a hat and a pair of shorts?
Where did you acquire the knowledge to bake?
He can't kick us out for pie, right?
Expecting company?
That's your first apple pie. It smells like heaven, but I'll bet it tastes like hell.
Don't get me wrong, I love apple pie.
I'm pretty sure that still counts.
You got this from a tree?
Adam had already turned down the apple once. Nevertheless, she persisted.
Alternative Facts won't change history.
Oh, you shouldn't have.
Pretty sure apple pie is still a no-go
Original recipe... Original Sin... it's a tough decision!
I didn't hear Him say, "unless they are baked in a pie."
Oh, THAT One in The Oven.
All this, for a rib!
I'd more tempted if we had ice cream to go with it.
Sorry, I'm dieting with the help of my new motto, 'A minute on the lips, entire human history on the hips.'
She was warned. She was given an explanation. Neverthelessssss, she persisted.
Honey, it's snake and bake.
Wait, it's whose recipe?
Adam had tried to explain that he didn't like apple pie, yet she persisted.
When I said I wanted your warm apples, this is not what I had in mind.
Smells good--and evil.
Eating this will make me want to look down?
Can I tempt you ?
It would be a shame not to eat it.
As long as it's not apple.
That's great, Eve. Now if only He had created forks...
Organic. Fair-trade.Vegan. Sugar-free. It would be a sin NOT to take a bite!
Holy smokes! What the devil is that?
Don't you think sharing a cigarette is a bit more appropriate?
In this case, the way to eternal damnation is through a man's stomach.
I have no idea who Sara Lee is.
Well, I bet it's a pretty wicked recipe.
Oh, you can cook. My mom's going to love you. Wait, do I have a mother?
You never told me you can bake.
It is my cheat day.
Is that your mother's recipe?
Now I'm REALLY confused!
So beganeth the little known story of Adam and Marie Calender...
She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.
You did all that PLUS you built an oven?
Peach, I hope?
Great ... sinful and fattening --
You did WHAT with my rib?
I think we both know where this will lead?
Did he say anything about apple pie?
I hope it's rhubarb.
Forbidden fruit gives me gas.
What are the side-effects?
How about them apples?
Upping the ante?
You're sure it's blueberry.
You want a piece of this?
Looks tempting! What could it hurt to try a piece?
After eating from the tree of knowledge, I found a loophole
How do you know it will increase my self-awareness?
This will really mess up some Bible stories.
Is that Adam's apple pie?
Can I get that to go?
You made me a pie? What's the catch?
It's an "alternative" apple
Wow, will these temptations never end?
What happens if I just eat the CRUST?
You know, that would be a lot more tempting with some ice cream!
Want a piece?
I've got a bad feeling about this.
Fool me once, fool me twice!
God damnit
Is it locally sourced?
Please tell me it's cherry?
Just desserts! My favorite!
Ok, but I won't inhale.
Let me guess.
"If guests are coming you'd better put some clothes on".
I'm not really tempted unless you add ice cream.
He didn't forbid piety.
Wow, that smells sinfully delicious...
Any chance of a la mode?
If I try it, then! can we have sex?
You got the recipe from a serpent?
I guess He didn't say anything about forbidden fruit pie.
A rib for a pie. Yeahhhhhh, that seems fair.
You bake, too?
Holy cow! I must be in paradise!
He's sending mixed messages about this whole forbidden thing.
So that's where the apple went.
Wait a minute, you say it's your grandmother's recipe?
No way. Next thing I know, you'll want me to wear pants.
Thanks Eve but I'm really a Windows kinda guy.
That doesn't look like Devil's Food cake.
You can bake too?
Where in hell did you find an oven?!
Thisssss is Alternative Sin, go ahead it's OK.
You're absolutely sure he created a Cheat Day?
I think we should consult an attorney.
Are you sure this is sin-free?
It's apple pie not an apple -so I think we are ok.
But wouldn't you rather eat afterward?
Holy cow! You really do want to leave.
Sacrilicious
Should I dress before or after dinner?
Tell me it isn't apple.
I thought we were having ribs tonight.
Oh wow... Lilith never baked...
But it doesn't smell like pumpkin pie.
Please tell me that's a peach cobbler.
I got the recipe from a trustworthy source.
Please tell me that's rhubarb.
"I thought Devil's Food was a cake!
"'The Pie of Knowledge'? What an odd thing to call it.
Oh gosh, I really shouldn't.
Your mother's recipe? Why do I feel like I'm being tricked?
Can I get some ribs with that?
The devil is in the details.
Yeah, but it's not Mom's.
It's legal here in Colorado.
Well, it does look sinfully delicious...
So, pie is square with God?
Don't worry, it's Rhubarb.
My gosh, why didn't I think of that!? Nobody will notice!
We're cooked.
No thanks, the last one you made me tasted like eternal damnation...
That better be mock apple pie.
I guess a small piece won't hurt .
You're sure its not apple?
What do you mean the apples were free?
Forbidden fruit? My favorite!
Eve, how is it less forbidden that way?
I'm telling you, it's to die for.
Honey, you invented the oven!
Which tree did you make this from again?
This is how it starts, doesn't it?
That looks to die for!
The serpent told you to bite it not bake it.
You never give up. Do you, Eve.
Lemme guess. Apple?
How about just a hug?
And you're sure He won't notice what's in there?
If this does it, we'll name it Piagra.
OMG Sara . . .Eve is going to get suspicious!
I still think it's a no no.
Don't you think we're poking the bear a little bit?
Tell me you didn't get the recipe' from the snake.
That looks heavenly.
It smells delicious! Hey, let's dress for dinner.
And I can eat it and have it too?
So cooking destroys the knowledge?
I hope you didn't use local apples.
I thought you were going to make a Devil's food cake?
Aw, shucks. It was just one rib.
You go ahead. I ordered a pizza.
You are right, he didn't say anything about apple pie.
When life gives you apples, make apple-pie.
Tell me it's rhubarb
That's a tiny bit better, but I still think it will count
Smells like you went heavy on the sin o' men
Another spinach pie in paradise ... what I would give for a little fresh fruit.
Mom and apple pie? What the heck is a Mom?
Whose recipe? The devil you say!
I'm on the Paleo diet; you can't tempt me.
If it means we have to put clothes on, I don't want it.
Well now it's even more sinful...
No, I don't think He'll think it's okay now.
The real sin here is the added carbs.
Looks positively tempting.
It's half-baked like your rib story.
I hope that's pecan,
So if I eat it, I'll understand why it doesn't count?
Well, you did say when life gives you apples...
I hope it's not an apple pie?
What kind is it?" "Apple sin-amon.
You're sure it's OK if they're baked in a pie?
OK with me, but His legal department may have some issues with this.
I must be in Paradise.
I can't, I'm paleo
But she persisted."
But is it kosher?
Damned if you do...damned if you don't.
I thought we agreed you wouldn't lead us into temptation.
You are sure this is the peach one, right?
I don't know. Maybe we should go with peaches. Apples seem to piss Him off big time.
It's your grandmother's recipe? I'm confused...
Original sin-namon apple pie!?! My favorite!
Oh yeah, Sin and Death are coming over at 6, right?
Thank God you finally gave up trying to get me to eat those damned apples.
I mean....He never said anything about apple pie...
Can't go wrong with apple.
I'm going to need deniability. Tell me it's blueberry.
"What part of all-knowing do you not understand?'
Do I even want to know?
They say this is the way to a man's rib.
How can that possibly be your mother's old family recipe?
Well, as long as it's gluten free...
Alternative fact: All the forbidden was baked out
Where did you plug in the oven?
In God we crust.
No matter how we slice it there's no going back.
So, sugar coating it will make everything okay?
Well, it does look wicked good.
When is this fucking acid going to wear off?
Smells great, but what if I eat it and all-hell breaks out in America 6,000 years from now?
It'll be worth it.
Apple pie! What's next, motherhood?
I don't know why I'm thinking this but you really should feed it to the snake.
You are drastically overestimating my willpower.
I dunno, looks sinful.
What harm could come from one little piece of pie?
It looks, I want to say, heavenly.
That smells so good, it has to be something I shouldn't eat.
Do you really believe this will make the garden great again?
Ooh, that DOES smell tempting!
Oh no! You've been to Hell's Kitchen again!
But if we eat it we will have knowledge of gluten and evil.
Okay, I'll bite. What could be the harm of just one piece?
God, that smells sinfully good.
Wow, what a great way to get around that silly rule.
smells like apples and sin-a-man.
I'll take a bite, if you tell me how you have a belly button?
I really wanted the iPhone 7 when I said anything Apple
The only sin here is that store-bought pie crust.
Trust me. It's sinfully delicious.
Tempting.........
I think you overcooked the metaphor.
I dunno, I'm on this paleo diet...
You are a woman ahead of your time.
Where did you discover an oven?
Oh my God! Marry me!
I hope this turns out better than the last time
The story of Adam and Eve based on newly discovered "Alternative Facts."
Sure, I'll have some. What is the harm from just a slice?
Please tell me that's cherry.
Gosh, I never thought I'd have to choose between pie and piety.
It just really feels like He wants us to eat the apples...
Pie à la nude?
Umm... Thanks, but I'll stick with ignorance.
Uhhh...you had me at the apple.
Welcome to the neighborhood Steve. I baked this pie for you and Adam.
Oh, great. Now I have to invent ice cream.
Still can't. I'm knowledge-intolerant.
If God gives you apples, make apple pie.
I thought we decided on peach.
As long as it wasn't the Tree of Canned Filling.
And I was so sure that God didn't make little green apples.
Suddenly, Adam realized that eternal banishment from Paradise wouldn't be such a bad deal.
How do you like them apples?
Wait, you said that this is your Mom's recipe?
They were out of spare ribs.
Now, that is tempting. [Note: "that" should be italicized.]
Wow! That looks sinfully delicious!
That looks sinfully delicious!
Is the apple locally-sourced?
There's nothing else in the oven, right?
I don't remember HIM saying anything about pie.
Technically it's a pie, so I think we're in the clear.
We're going out BIG, baby!
So God didn't say if we ate the fruit we will die? He really said please enjoy a pie?
Wow, Apple pie, now that's tempting.
I can't handle sweets, I know I'll pay for it later.
Please tell me that's not apple pie.
Now that you mention it, I don't recall a word against apple pie.
Brilliant! Apple pie's not covered by the ban!
Is this what you meant by, “Life is short. Eat dessert first”?
Well, he said nothing about pies, right?
Please tell me that it's not apple.
You really want me to eat that apple, don't you?
I was really hoping you'd make cherry.
Tell me that's not fresh from Hell's oven.
...an eternity on the hips.
No, I asked if you know what pi is.
I can't, I'm on the Paleo diet.
Well, he didn't say we couldn't bake.
So...the original tart bearing tart?
so, you think it's ok if it's baked in a pie?
tempting. It looks sinfully good.
No wonder they call this the Garden of Eatin'
Mmmmm, smells originally sinful.
First the Apple-now the pie, you REALLY Don't Listen!
Is that original cinnamon I smell in that pie?
Peach?
So, you think this is a valid loophole? Cause it sure smells good!
Uh, ladies first.
The snake is technically correct, He did say "APPLES", not "APPLE PIE".
Pie of the fruit of the tree of knowledge? What's pie?
I will not eat it from your hand. I will not eat if from a pan.
I guess you're right, apple pie isn't the same thing as an apple.
God, that smells sinfully good.
Why do I feel this will end, badly!
God forbid you have dessert just once.
No thanks. I just started the Paleo diet.
Didn't he say gluten was a no-no?
You're sure it's blueberry.
Please tell me it's blueberry.
Well, it's sure tempting.
I'm really sorry. I guess you still don't get it. I'm with Steve.
So that's what happened to the leftover forbidden fruit.
Wow, you made that with just one apple?
Been watching Hell's Kitchen again, huh?
Now, did He say 'No apple' or 'No pie?
If I eat of this pie will I acquire knowledge of gluten and evil?
Wow. You must really think I'm an idiot.
Gee, it looks tempting.
If it makes you happy. One bite couldn't hurt.
Tricky---I'll wait for the Ninth Circuit's ruling
On the 4,543,000,013th day, God said to Adam, "“From anything gluten free you may eat freely; but from the pie of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die from diabetes, cancer, and obesity.”
I thought you said you were making devil food cake.
I can still smell knowledge in there. Knowledge is for losers. Sad.
Eve, I know alternative facts are a big trend these days. But an apple remains an apple...
At least now we'll get kicked out on a full stomach
These seems like another one of your half baked ideas.
When you told me this morning that you wanted to put one in the oven I thought we'd be raising Cain.
Oh sweetie, you remembered our one day anniversary!
You're killing me
Still doesn't tempt me.
So you're saying if it's cooked it's no longer knowledge and I can eat it?
We already messed up, let's eat some apple pie.
Brilliant! Pie changes everything.
That pie smells heavenly.
Uhh are you sure you know how this story goes?
I don't know, babe. I'm still full from the ribs.
You could have had me with an apple.
After this life will never be the same
Did you get Pi from the Tree of Knowledge?
So they finally delivered the oven?
My eyes were on the pie!!
Aren't you full from the ribs?
Clothes, chairs, a roof over our heads -- I'm in.
And you're certain it's mock apple pie?
Smells divine!
Wait until he hears about this!
Wait, did you use the forbidden oven?
Are you sure " pie " makes it OK ?
No matter how you slice it, we're still outta here!
Why do you keep calling it "sinfully delicious?"
So...I put in my THUMB and pull out a ... WHAT?
It better not be apple
It's "Dating Naked" meets "The Great British Baking Show."
Do you want me to believe you invented fire?
Just curious. Where was it baked?
It's not the apple, it's the carbs and fat that worry me.
You got the recipe from a what?!
And it's apple free?
Cherry, you say? Okay, I'll have a bite.
So that makes it OK?
We have a PIE tree!
That looks just SINFUL.
Mmm ... smells like bad decisions.
Okay, now you're just banking on the technicality.
That pie sure looks tempting.
Oh lord, let's hope it's cherry pie.
What is ice-cream and why am I craving it?
Let's call the crust Original Thin.
Are you sure the fruit wasn't locally sourced?
Not apple, again!
It would be more tempting if we had whipped cream.
We're cooked.
Clearly these weren't His exact words.
Can we get it to go?
Is this an "alternative" apple?
PLEASE tell me that's a peach pie!
Who told you I like apple pie?
What do you mean, exactly, by 'sinfully delicious'...?
Well you're right I guess; He didn't say anything about baking it in a pie.
Tart.
Frankly, I'd rather raise a little Cain.
Rhubarb again?
Can I get that to go?
Please don't tell me it's apple.
The serpent just mentioned something about ice cream?...
That's so hot.
We weren't supposed to use the oven.
just deserts?
Wow, that is to-get-banished for.
No worries, it's blueberry
Where did you say you got the oven?
Can we have the main course first?
Wow! Apple pie a la nude!
An apple pie! Oh, you shouldn't have.
It's probably not forbidden in pie form.
Is it a sin to love dessert?
I guess a small slice wouldn't be a huge sin...
You're sure its not apple?
That better be a fig pie.
No thanks, I'm doing paleo.
What do I think? I think you're a terrific baker and a terrible listener.
MOCK! I said MOCK apple pie!
Wow. Apple Pie! God Bless You,Eve
Maybe we should get dressed for the occasion?
My new snake friend says this pie is just to die for!
No thanks, look I'll just call you later.
It smells sinfully delicious.
I don't mind apple pie, but I don't feel comfortable starting this gender dynamic
Please tell me it's peach.
Very tempting, but what is it ?
That'll go straight to my mortality.
I think it still counts.
Oh my Go! Say it isn't apple!
You're sure there are no apples?
Who gave you the recipe?
Alright, just one bite. What harm could it do?
No, Kelly Anne. Alternative forbidden fruit is still forbidden fruit.
I think he's gonna be more angry that you used his oven.
Please tell me that's strawberry-rhubarb.
"Hmmm, I guess it's not really like eating an apple off the tree".
He said-- something, something, apples... ahh screw it, we should be fine.
I didn't realize we have an oven.
Umm, you didn’t cook that on the burning bush, did you?
OMG! That's positively sinful!
Any known side effects?
Okay. I guess I can diet when I'm in Hell.
I hope that is blueberry pie.
I sure hope that's cherry.
Which one is my pie hole?
A meat pie? It's amazing what you can make from ribs!
So you think He won't mind if you used canned apples?
I'm tempted but I filled up on unicorn
Too... many... metaphors...
The calories alone seem sinful.
Thanks, but I'll go with the fig leaf.
Think you can tempt me by putting it in a pie?
Don't worry, it's blueberry.
Unfortunately, I just started the pre-paleo diet.
I'm pretty sure he said 'definitely eat the pie'.
Is it organic and gluten free?
We need to wait for it to cool. What should we do in the meanwhile?
Forbidden fruit pie again?
Something tells me I may regret this, but what the hell?
Look, I said I would join the nudist colony, but no way in hell am I going to eat hot pie naked.
I'm tempted. But I worry about getting burned.
The genesis of Atheism
Hmm, you're right. He didn't say a word about baked goods.
'Alternative apples,' huh? Well...I suppose that makes it all right.
That'd be really tempting with a cup of coffee.
Thanks, but why pumpkin?
A moment on the lips, forever on the conscious as the root of suffering for all mankind.
What's next; motherhood?
The Pied Viper?
When I said I was hankering for something hot, I didn't have apple pie in mind.
There's no vanilla ice cream in Paradise?
I'm not worried about the forbidden fruit--it's the carbs that scare me!
It's tempting, but I'm eating Paleo.
Well, as long as it's sugar-free what could be the harm?
Now this story is believable.
And here I thought we already lived in paradise.
What, no ice cream?
Is it knowledge free?
But God knows I like cherry better.
So now the story is fully baked.
Is that from the Original Recipe?
Maybe we should get a second opinion.
You had me at the apple!
"You know that's going to go straight to my asp".
Sssss, try the pie, it's life-changing.
So what's the downside here, I gain a pound or two.Big deal.
Plausible deniability, right?
Please tell me it isn't apple!
I distinctly heard The Lord say, "let there be a la mode.'
Smells like Heaven on Earth.
Wait...is that gluten-free?
And you're sure it's kosher?
Nice workaround, but something tells me that it still qualifies.
Are the apples ethically sourced?
So all I have to do is marry you and I get this all the time?
At least it's not devil's food.
Are you SURE that nothing was said about apple PIE?
Is it in its original tin?
I'd say it's as good as my mom's, but come to think of it...I don't recall having one.
So God is going to throw us out of Paradise because you found an oven?
Does it have nuts? I shouldn't have nuts.
I'll be working this off for awhile.
Of course it's organic. This is paradise , isn't it.
Oh my God, I'm so high.
I know that it smells sinfully delicious, but...
Tell me you have vanilla ice cream, and we have a deal.
Welcome to the Garden of Eatin'.
Is it forbidden-fruit-free?
Wait, let me put on a fig leaf first.
You're right. I did say "surprise me."
That was our last apple!
The lawyers say this night work
We're having company?
What's Mom's Apple Pie?
Looks tempting, but are calories the only consequence?
Evey, how can it be 'Mom's Apple Pie" when we don't even have a mother !
I don't know if it's worth it given the calories and being cast out.
Wow! But be sure to save a piece for You-Know-Who.
That smells absolutely sinful !
I realize you're my only choice, but I'm not looking for a long term thing here.
It smells sinfully delicious.
If I just smell it, can I see you naked?
How do you make pie without an oven?" "How do you make me without a uterus?
I really want a piece of that.
You can't fool me with culinary semantics, Eve.
How about Adam's Apple?
Sure. Why not? He didn't say anything about eating a pie.
Tempting. . . Is that blueberry or forbidden?
You mean it won't count since it's in a pie?
Should I just dig in or shall we wait a day or so for God to create utensils.
I doubt He'll be too upset if we save him a slice.
The smell of original cinnamon is so tempting.
That looks sinful. If you have some ice cream, I might be tempted.
Now, are you or the pie forbidden? The fruit reference is always lost on me.
I can do forbidden fruit. It's the gluten I can't handle.
So, you're saying this is how we're supposed to be fruitful and multiply?
I don't think baking Him a pie is going to get us back into His good graces.
Just once, Eve, don't try to confuse the issue.
Are you sure he can't see through crust?
I sure hope that's blueberry pie.
You're right, He never mentioned 'forbidden pie'!
You have upped your game since yesterday.
Wait a second it can't be mom's apple pie
God I hope that is rhubarb
Don't tell me I forgot our anniversary?
Sorry, Eve, but I have trouble believing your mother gave you the recipe."
You said a snake gave you this recipe?
Life or pie?
That's awesome, Eve. They will write books about this.
He told us not to go anywhere near that windowsill.
I'm cutting out gluten, can I have just the apple?
"Eve steps up her cooking game in: 'Temptation II: The Garden of Eatin''
From the sky? Sounds plausible.
Did you remember to turn the oven off?
The forbidden fructose.
Wow that's really tempting. What's in it?
It's warm - I guess it would be a sin not to try it
Wow! A little knowledge is a good thing!
Something tells me that blueberry would be a better option.
Since baseball and hot dogs didn't cause any problems, sure why not?
Let me guess. Your mother's here for a visit.
Are the apples knowledge-free?
Oh? No...bye, bye Miss American Pie.
Please tell me the apple thing is fake news.
Did you get it to go?
That's not what I meant by pious.
"I'm new here. What could go wrong?'
Eve, if that's apple pie, we're outta here!
Well, we may as well go all the way..... Here, have some apple pie.
The chrust is risen
Don't worry, it's peach.
Whew! Now you are really tempting me!!
Apple pie for dessert? Shouldn't we have the ribs for dinner first!?
Hmm, apple pie does sound tempting.
So...your position is that God forbade eating an apple, but eating an apple derivative will hedge our downside risk?
If we're gonna get banished...might as well go on a full stomach
It's an alternative apple. Tremendous. Believe me.
Your apple pie is downright sinful.
Isn't it a sin to start with dessert?
Wait, didn't God say not to eat from the tree of knowledge of stereotyped gender roles?
3.14159?
Are you sure you didn't use any of those round red things from the tree?
Smells heavenly. Let's have a taste.
Something wrong, we haven't created fire yet
I call it the original sin-amon
Please don't tell me that's apple pie.
The snake said it would make America great again.
Oh my God. Your apple pie is sinful.
Who's recipe?
Please tell me it's not apple.
He never mentioned using an oven.
No ice cream?
Art thou Eve of Destruction?
OK, but only if it's organic.
I think you're missing the point.
It's sinfully delicious.
And on the eighth day, God created apple pie.
So where is the oven?
Yes, I'm tempted, but shouldn't we wait until they invent ice cream?
That's your survival tool? Did Naked And Afraid move to the Food Network?
Wait. It's your Mom's recipe?"
No, it's not that it's forbidden, I just thought we were gluten-free.
Just take a bite, Donald. Maybe you'll learn something.
It's rhubarb, right? Please tell me it's rhubarb.
Anyway you slice it, it's apple.
I don't think this makes it any better...
With no oven, where in the hell did you do that?
So, Mr. Snake here says you make a hell of an apple pie.
Dessert? I guess one bite won't hurt...
I thought cherry was a better choice, given the circumstances.
It's cherry, right?
Just how many original sins are in that?
Well okay, today's my cheat day.
Quick, eat this so I can get some clothes.
Ah, apple pie and thee in paradise! What could go wrong?
Knowledge Free I hope.
Well, that's not exactly correct but I guess 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510 is close enough.
Hate the sin. Love the sinner. Hate the sin. Love the sinner.
ooh, that is tempting.
Is it organic?
For humanity's sake let's hope it's pecan
"You used Red Delicious? Now *that* is a sin.
I sure hope that's rhubarb!
God I love apple pie.
What if I just eat the crust?
The first usage of "alternative facts."
"I made it with a red thing that was hanging off that tree".
As long as it's not apple.
Which is my pie hole again?
OK, but only if it's Mock Apple Pie . . .
Eve, please tell me that's a peach cobbler.
Pie or no pie, I'm pretty sure this is going to get us banished.
Looks good, but is it organic?
You're ribbin' me, right?
Yeah, but no ice cream? Now that's evil.
Just take a bite, it's apple sin-ammon.
Law school was really wasted on you, wasn't it?
No thanks. I just started the Paleo diet.
And you're positive it's cherry?
It's from the Market on Eden.
Please tell me it's blueberry.
How the Hell are you holding that without oven mitts? Also, what the Hell is Hell?
Jesus crust that looks good.
I don't have a clue what "Mom" means, but let's eat!
Can't fool me - we don't have an oven.
Did you use Dad's recipe?
Now, did he say "do not heat it" or "eat it?"
It smells delicious, but who is this Sara Lee?
Oh no! I forgot the ice cream!
Oh Lord, I hope he won't mind the original cinnamon.
You really made this with Ritz crackers?
The serpent says it's gluten -free, dairy-free, and a little trans-fat couldn't hurt.
Oh Babe, that is so tempting, but I just went on the Paleo Diet.
You swear it's pumpkin?
You're not fooling anyone by baking it.
Seriously? I thought we were paleo.
My ribs were better.
Isn't that the forbidden bakery?
The last one gave me an Adam's Apple
Well, everything else about this is made up, so I guess we can get away with this...
Who's Marie Callender?
Kellyanne, what do you mean this is from the tree of alternative knowledge?
It's no longer fruit if it's in a pie--right?
Well, isn't that tempting!
Apple pie, huh? Hm... it smells tempting... very tempting...
The First Lobbyist
Have we invented fire yet?
If I'd known you were going to all this trouble, I'd have thrown something nicer on.
Enough already with the forbidden fruit pies.
It smells amazing, but are you sure it's kosher?
You had one in the oven??
I can't decide. Can you lower it a bit?
You never bake. What did you do?
You really think we can get away with a technicality on this?
Yeah, uh, thanks - looks great - but I just ate fruit from the Tree of the Knowledge of Diet and Nutrition.
I guess you're right. He didn't say anything about not eating a pie.
"I'm not sure apples and oranges is the best defense here".
So if I eat a piece of this pie I can see you naked?
Just answer me one question: Where the heck did you find an oven?
Is it sinfully delicious?
Apple?
This story's getting harder and harder to swallow.
Eve, tell me that's not your sinfully delicious Apple Pie!!
You just can't leave things alone, can you?
Great! But who fixed the oven?
So you're not in the mood- again?
Please, you can't expect to tempt me with "it's just like my mom used to bake"!
Do I smell cinnamon...or sin, woman?
You make a good point: What could be more American?
What the hell is this?
No! I said not apple!
So then, if we're not supposed to eat that kind of fruit..why at this particular time in history would He have given us an oven?
It's tempting -- but why rhubarb?
Does HE know it's apple free?"
Apple is good, but I prefer the cherry.
OK, I'm going to be totally honest with you, I have no idea what á la Mode means.
Let's see if I can recall - baked? Could be a possible loophole!
It looks tempting, but I really shouldn’t.
As long as they're not genetically modified, what could possibly go wrong?
Didn't that voice tell us to stay away from sugar and white flour?
Ok we'll eat it, but you can't tell anyone else.
My apologies, future generations, but you wouldn't resist this either.
But how could it be better than my mother's?
Just watch how they report this
Oh, thanks, but you haven't taken a bite out of it yet.
Just have one bite, Eve ... it's my best pie, ever!
What part of Satan do you not understand?
Honey, that pie looks to die for.
But, Eve, America hasn't been discovered yet.
Alternative fact?
Don't tempt me. You know I'm trying to go Paleo!
what's an oven?
Wow -- go big or go home!
Apple sin-omen?
Here. I made you an Original Sinnamon Apple pie.
Apple, I assume.
The snake and I have something to tell you
I dunno. Can't we have pizza.
Is that the original recipe?
Are there nuts in that?
It's blueberry. Trust me!
Who's Betty Crocker?
That is very tempting and wouldn't it be a sin to waste it?
It's tempting . . . but is it gluten-free?
We don't have mothers. Whereja learn to make pie crust?
Well , hello Marie Callender. What happened to Eve?
Why its as American as motherhood and Original Sin.
Oh God, I totally forgot to get the fig leaves.
The apples aren't the problem. It's the gluten I'm worried about.
Are you sure that crust is gluten-free?
Sorry, but I won't be able to grasp the concept of hot food until the Neolithic era.
Shouldn't we do something about the original tin?
Nice try but I still think that we are going to get kicked out.
No way, Eve--unless you also have a scoop of vanilla.
Are you sure this is what he meant by piety?
It's just dessert.
I asked for a muffin.
So ‘to REALLY KNOW if it’s good or bad’…I have to try it?
Where did you learn to cook?
It's the forbidden high-fructose corn syrup.
Honey, how did you bake the pie? We haven't discovered fire yet.
Cain said he'd kill for a piece.
Thanks, but I just want an apple
Just tell me how did you discover fire to warm it up honey?
I thought temptation was the snake's schtick.
Your mother's recipe?
OK. So if the apples are baked in the pie that's Kosher?
You think He won't notice it's in a pie?
It's just not that tempting when you bake it in a pie
No thanks. I'm Paleo.
That smells like sin.
Just like mom's.
If that snake made it without an oven, his place must be hot as ... it must be really hot.
Genesis 3:6 Mrs. Smith's Version
Lots of original cinnamon?
Wait, did God invent vanilla ice-cream yet?
It's peach.
Relax, it's blueberry.
Well, you can't say 'it's like your mother use to make!'
You didn't.
Something tells me I'm not your first.
I suppose the snake taught you how to make a flaky pie crust too.
This is all a trap, isn't it?
Where the HELL did you get that?
I was expecting something less nuanced.
GEE- WHIZ YOU TWO KNOW HOW TO TEMPT A GUY !
If we're going to be kicked out of Eden, you could have at least added whipped cream.
An old family recipe?
He really said 'okay?'
Well now you're just rubbing it in his face.
Tell me that's not APPLE pie.
You're sure it's kosher, right?
So the snake is confident His executive order is unconstitutional?
Do you think one slice would be sinful?
Pie doesn't count, right?
So the snake gave you the recipe?
What is an 'alternative apple'?
sorry, no, i'm paleo
Is it apple?
Come on, it's our cheat day.
Mow what lawn?
No one said anything about not eating apple pie
Pie is fine, but I was more in the mood for a rib.
Are you sure it's Paleo?
Err, that's not exactly what I meant when I said I wanted to eat your pie.
I thought you said there was a bun in the oven
Hmm; that sure smells like the apple you offered me earlier. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice...
Oh no! Is that from the forbidden Martha Stewart tree?
At 750 calories, that's REALLY sinful.
I would, but I just started Paleo yesterday.
I'm actually just going to eat the crust. The rest is all yours.
I never heard of a Devil's food pie
Original cinnamon? Are you sure?
No Adam, there aren't any freaking apples in there.
No, it's actually cherry.
OK, you're right. HE didn't say we couldn't eat the apple pie of life.
I was actually thinking ribs
I find it hard to believe this was made from my mother-in-law's recipe.
As an originalist and textualist, I say we eat it.
You make it so hard to stick to my deity.
I don’t care if the pie is filled with forbidden fruit. It's the gluten that I'm worried about.
Did you turn off the oven?
But they haven't invented ovens yet.
But did you make it from scratch?
Thanks, but I'm not hungry after sex
Well, when life hands you lemons...
Wow! I think you just invented deniability!
Well, we can kiss our deposit good-bye.
Of course! 3.141592653.....
And he ate it with a fork. And it was good.
I'd prefer key lime, you go ahead.
Are you sure that's what third base feels like?
Eve, this is not what I meant by sweetening the deal.
But I thought we only had one apple... How did you make a pie?
Can I get a piece to go?
Sorry, honey, I'm on a sin-free diet.
Don't tempt me with carbs!
Feels kinda...unoriginal.
PLEASE tell me that's a peach pie!
I don't know. I like Paradise, but that pie sure smells good.
What do you mean, original pie?
Tempting, but I thought we were Paleo.
So the snake gave you the recipe?
Where the hell did you find an apple corer, a peeler, a knife, a cutting board, and an oven?
That is really not the pie I had in mind, Eve.
That's a pie to die for!
Just think of it as alternative apple!
I don't know...seems half-baked.
So you're sure this is blueberry.
It's tempting, but I distinctly remember ordering blueberry.
All this, and you bake too?
It looks like the next best thing to paradise.
Now, that's better. I'm glad you finally stopped trying to make me eat those darn apples!
Pssst! Go ahead and eat it, what harm can it do?
Well, maybe just one little slice
And you're telling me the snake gave you the recipe, too?
Mmm, Eve, that apple pie's to die for.
So you think He won't notice it's apple?
Tempting, but I'll just have a cappuccino.
Cherry?
Pie? God, I really shouldn't.
You baked all the knowledge out!
Yeah, I'd love to try it but when did we get an oven?
If you're going to tempt me with it anyway, make it alamode.
Is this your idea of foreplay?!?
So you have fire now?
Am I going to be naked after I eat this?
Let me guess: Bannon gave you the recipe?
For the hundredth time. I need Pants. Not Pie. PANTS.
Well, I say it's rhubarb and I say to Hell with it!
It won't work--he's mad as hell.
What happened to Steve?
Well, you're right. He didn't say "you shall not eat the PIE baked from the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge."
How on Earth did a snake bake a pie without arms? Or an oven!?
Let me guess, apple again?
How did you even bake ANYTHING?
Then why would God teach me to bake?
Let's dress and go out for dinner instead.
Your alternative facts are confusing me.
'But he told you not to heat it'
Was it sourced locally?
Shouldn't you use your newfound knowledge for something less domestic?
I don't really eat carbs.
You promise this is peach?
He said blueberry was OK...right?
Nah. I'll have an apple instead.
I hope it's blueberry.
We're going to blame you one way or another.
Can we get it to go?
So, the fall of man begins with a Mrs. Smith's?
It may still have a bitter after-taste.
Don't tempt me, I'm still trying to lose the other rib.
I really hope that's a mock apple pie.
Just tell me it's peach.
I guess you two are right, putting the forbidden fruit in a pie does give us plausible deniability.
Does it count if it's in a pie?
How can we commit Original Sin without ice cream?
Apple 2.0? That makes sense - the first version had bugs.
Is it good-and-evil free?
Wasn't One Apple Enough?
Is it cheat day?
What the hell is "apple pie"?
I don't know where you found an oven, but it sure is tempting.
So now I gotta be evil AND fat-shamed?
Is that a Devil's Food Cake?
I know you put a lot of effort into this, but could you just stop saying that it's sinfully delicious?
Maybe we should rethink this loophole idea.
Alt-apples, huh?
Tell me you didn't cut down the Tree of Knowledge to cook that thing.
Actually, I'm more a lemon meringue guy.
Well if the snake says it's OK if they're baked...
An apple in any other form is still an apple, Eve.
Oh, God! Please tell me it's blueberry!
Honey, we can't afford to move.
No Eve! It's still the forbidden fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Wait--what's that--cinnamon?
Original Recipe or Original Sin?
Ooh Eve...that looks good and evil at the same time...!
I think you're getting way ahead of yourself
Now he's really going to be pissed!
Does it count if they're baked?
I should have been more specific when I said pasties.
You're sure it's peach?
Eight hundred calories a slice is the real sin here!
Are you sure it's all right to eat an alternative fact?
That smells sinful.
Snake and bake perfection!
I dunno. . . a moment on the lips, an eternity of damnation and torment for us and for everyone who will ever be born.
can it wait until someone invents ice cream?
That better be blueberry.
Eve dear, God isn't fooled by pie dough.
Not tonight. I have a headache.
Yeah, I think it doesn't count if it's baked.
Okay, but you'll be sorry during childbirth, whatever that is.
Wow! Apple pie! What a brilliant recipe for the Fall!
Thanks, but I'm more in the mood for Thai.
It's not so much God's wrath as the trans fat that concerns me.
Hmmm, do I smell SIN-amin?
None for me. Sugar is the devil.
Oh god, is today the anniversary?
"Well the big guy didn't say anything about forbidden fruit PIE...".
I love it when you bake in the nude.
Are you sure this is OK? We don't want this to be blown all out of proportion by you know who.
Knowledge of good, evil, and the perfect, flaky pie crust? That is tempting.
I didn't know you had a mother.
Well, I guess if they came from the tree of alternate knowledge....
You were naked when you made that?
Does this count?
Even if it's in a pie, He'll notice!
Depends. Is this the original sin recipe?
Thanks, but I'm watching my weight - I'll just have an apple.
Let me guess, apple pie?
Oh no, I forgot to save room for pie.
Mmmm...Do I smell fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil pie ?
I guess a small piece wouldn't hurt.
American Pie - Bible edition
Are you sure he said it was for the original tin ?
Apple pie? Yes, I'm sure it IS sinfully delicious.
That better not be apple pie.
I hope it's peach.
I still want to have that conversation about gender roles when this is all done.
Well that's original!
Adam's apple
No, Eve, I said it CAN'T be apple.
Is this an original recipe?
What have you done with my original tin?!
I can smell the original cinnamon!
I think we'd better talk to a lawyer to be sure.
What's a pie?
Well of course it's our anniversary!
From an old family recipe?
Oh no! You baked the apple?
What about motherhood?
Apple?
Well, I guess, if it's in a pie...
I know I should wait until we invent ice cream, but what the heck!
Honey, you shouldn't have. Seriously. You. Should. Not. Have.
Please tell me it's peach.
It smells divine and it probably tastes sinful!
You sure know your way to a man's sinful nature.
It can't be your mother's recipe.
What? It's your mother's recipe?
This isn't the way the story is supposed to go.
An Apple pie?? I thought you said an apple! Well, this changes EVERYTHING!!
You said it's peach?
Your gramna's recipe? Really?
Does it have real fruit?
Oh, APPLE pie! Excellent selection.
Still, she persisted!
So, you're not going to tell me what is in your 'alternative apple pie?'
Just like Mom used to make...
Sorry, but it's no day in paradise if I eat gluten.
Don't worry, it's cherry.
Looks great. Did you copyright the Apple name?
Why must you tempt me? You know I'm on a diet.
Did he say anything about pie?
Wow, who taught you how to bake?
Let me guess—rhubarb!
OK, maybe just one bite!
I hope that's a peach pie.
Must have been created on day 3.14!
Apple and original cinnamon?
Hmm, He didn't say anything about pies.
Dessert? Didn't my ribs fill you up?
Not another test!
The serpeant promised ala mode.
It smells good, but I have a bad feeling about it.
It's from our new neighbors.
Taste this and go put on a pair of pants.
Tempting, but I'm gluten free.
Well, who can't resist pie?
The Cooking Channel, the root of all evil.
It seems more American than Sinful
Would you eat them in a pie? Would you with a snake?
Eve--that looks sinfully delicious!
If I try a slice, will you quit nagging me about that stupid tree?
Please, God ... tell me it's blueberry.
You're sure this will get us out of our timeshare?
To be honest, I had something totally different in mind when you said, "Come and get it!"
An oven, you found an oven. And a pie plate. What kind of pie is that? Oh, God.
Cherry, I hope.
Well, it is cheat day...
Original Sin-amon Apple
The calories don't count until we're kicked out of the garden, right?
A la mode would make this a much easier decision.
Are you suggesting motherhood is next?
God, that pie smells delicious.
It's creative...but I bet it'll still count against us.
But He said, "Of the apple, though shalt not heat."
Four and Twenty blackbirds? I suppose this was the snake's idea?
Where did you get the knowledge to bake an apple pie?
Is that my mom's recipe?
Eve's original sin-sational apple pie.
This is a little off-script but sure I'll have a taste.
Maybe you should have the first bite.
We were supposed to bring the appetizer!
Apple pie? I'm tempted
You do know I'm on the paleo diet, right?
No, sweetie I said "Snake nearby! NOT Bake me a pie!"
It's the "Original Sin-o-man" pie!
...and you're sure he said it was fine to eat if you baked it first?
And here I thought my spare ribs were awesome!
Well, my trainer did say I get one cheat day...
Original cinnamon?
Is that Adam's apple pie?
Ok, if you want to see other people that much, I'll take a bite of that damn apple.
I'm pretty sure it's forbidden in any form.
Who said, if we eat it standing up it doesn't count?
I don't know yet if it's good or bad.
Look, as long as we're sinning...'go big or go home' I say.
We don't have any clothes, so you bought an oven.
So that's the REAL reason he didn't want us to eat the apple.
I may not know good and evil, but I know fat calories when I see them.
I'd love to, but I'm on the Paleo diet.
Are you trying to tempt me or something?
Wow, a pie! Where'd you get the apples?
I don't think a 'bite out of the apple pie' will support the narrative.
Umm...yeah, I know you're mad, Eve. But I actually baked that pie for Steve.
Thanks, but I was really hoping for some new underwear.
Would you stop pushing this apple business and just offer sex.
Uh… yeah…. It’s just that in your profile pictures you were blonde is all
I guess carbs are OK now and again - what's the worst that can happen?
Why apple?
'Alternative apples', so it's okay?
Pie doesn't fix everything.
I was kind of hoping for a sandwich.
My head is telling me there is more trouble on the way.
What do you mean Alternatively forbidden?
Really Eve, blackbirds again!
I don't know, Eve....gluten.
Hey, what did you do with that apple?
Does this count?
So this is how we beget?
How about I say I thought it was Blueberry?
Ooh. That smells original sinfully delicious.
It looks beautiful. It smells delicious. It's very tempting!
I'll bite...
Wow! Apple pie. Sinful!
It's tempting, but I'm on a diet.
Where did you find the low hanging oven?
When life gives you apples ... PIE!
We need to find the vanilla ice cream tree.
You say this pie will cure my erectile dysfunction? I ask: "So what do you get out of fixing my E.D. - what's in it for you?
No, no, let me guess...apple pie?
I feel like He'll still know what's inside.
Throw it in my face and hope He just laughs.
Well, for starters, I'm...naked. And afraid.
Forbidden Fruit Pie! My favorite!
You make a compelling case.
I was hoping for banana cream.
Um...you know, I don't think God will be fooled.
Thanks a lot. Now I have to invent ice cream.
You've got the apple pie, now can we work on motherhood?
Can I just pick at the crust?
Is there sinamon in it?
Who's recipe?
Don't tell me, let me guess...Apple?
And you thought the apples were tempting.
Don't worry - it's fine! These are 'alternative apples!'
Well, at least it's original.
You're telling me this is my mother's recipe?
Are you sure this doesn't count?
Make it à la mode and you have yourself a deal.
Why do I suddenly know the number 3.14159265359. . .?
Another one of those half-baked ideas?
You're positive it's blueberry?
No thanks. High carbs are the new forbidden fruit.
That's not what I meant when I told you to cover the fruit...
So is this one of those when life gives you lemons situations?
Pie? Um, yeah okay, I was kind of led to expect spare ribs?
I don't want to seem like a know-it-all but was this the snake's idea?
When did you invent fire?
How did you bake that?
I thought we were paleo.
An original recipe? I guess it would be sinful not to eat it.
Well OK, but I still say it's a violation of the rules.
No, I'm not afraid to disobey Him, it's the gluten.
Oh no....Which tree??
"Gee honey I don't know, I'm still pretty full from your rib thing last week".
If it's apple pie is it still forbidden?
Just adding value to the proposition.
I love you Eve, but do you know how much rents are outside?
Farewell to Eden....Hellooo Miss American Pie!
You know, it's the craziest thing, but I feel like you're going to hit me in the face with that.
What's ya mean, like mother used to make?
I see how you got around it but it might anger Him even more.
Damn! I completely forgot the ice cream.
Maybe you're right. The apple ban didn't exactly say anything about pie.
The snake says it's better than Viagra!
It's tempting, it's sinful, it's decadent--but is it organic?
Oh what the heck... how bad can it be?
It's not nice to fool Mother Nature.
This is not just-another-day-in-paradise, is it?
You say, apple pie is OK, but apples are not
Really, Kale pie?
Yum. An Apple 3.14159
Well, hello, Martha Stewart!
On the seventh day he created 'Cheat Day'.
Really? Your mother's recipe ??
We’ll call it America First American apple pie, and then we can stay in Paradise. SO NICE.
It's not apple is it?
My mother's apple pie recipe?
What, no ice cream?
You're right; He didn't say a word about apple pie.
So you're saying if it's baked we can have our apples and eat them too?
You know that I'm on the Paleo Diet, right?
Planned Parenthood bake sale.
It's a tempting trade, Eve, but I don't have any spare ribs.
Huh. I heard, 'Apple means goodbye Eden" not "Apple means good pie-eating.
Ah Eve, you shouldn't have.
I have a feeling we should stick with cherry.
How did you figure out how to do that?
"Should be ok. The snake says it's called "Alternative facts".
Um, ok, but is it gluten-free?
I suppose a small slice won't hurt.
I don't think that the packaging will fool him!
Snacking doesn't have to be a sin.
How can I remember our birthday if we don't have one?
It's tempting but is it gluten free?
Shouldn't we dress for dinner?
Oh for Heaven's sake, let's get one thing straight, I'm not!
I don't know. The new neighbors brought it over.
'Forbidden fruit pie? and its local?
I had the strangest dream.
My nutritionist says to avoid forbidden fruit.
Hell's Kitchen: Day One
Where did you find an oven? Oh wait…is that an APPLE pie?
Decisions, decisions.
What in hell does, "My Grandma's recipe. ", mean?
Peach cobbler ruins the story.
Your mom's recipe? What's a mom?
Not another forbidden fruit pie again!
Looks pretty sinful to me!
You're really selling this apple thing.
So you are trying to tell me that we could have had pie this whole TIME!
The pie is hissing.
But babe, sugar is the root of all evil.
OMG, Eve!
God said that if we eat this not only will we have to leave the garden but we will have to workout 2x a day for the rest of our lives.
I don't think it matters if the fruit is in a pie, but if you have vanilla ice cream I don't care.
I thought we were having ribs tonight.
Technically, it's still fruit.
So, you're sure He said that it was OK as long as they were cooked, right?
Good and evil pie? You shouldn't have.
I don't know. You say it's free of original sin, but what about trans fats?
Bye bye Mesoamerican pie...
Why E, how nice! Whatever has gotten into you?
And you're CERTAIN apple pie doesn't count?
No! No! Carbs are forbidden!
That's easy for you to say snake, you haven't tried her baking.
He didn't say anything about not eating the pie.
Did you make it from scratch?
I'm hoping blueberry.
So you're saying it's okay to eat from the Pie of Knowledge?
Smells just like my mom's! Umm, wait a minute..
What's a housewarming?
Is that from Scratch?
Wow! 3.14... times better than an apple!
No, the forbidden fruit I get, but CORN SYRUP?
Smells heavenly
Aww, c'mon Eve -- not another forbidden fruit pie!
Adam, first foodie: "Are you sure the apples are locally sourced?"
Ok, then who invented the oven?
Fig pie? I asked for a fig leaf!
So the serpent said if the forbidden fruit were cooked in a pie, it is technically OK?
You don't want to know.
You can't hide the apple in the pie. He'll know.
Think He'd like a slice?
On the tenth day the Lord created Sarah and Lee
Thanks, but I'm still full from that apple.
It's a good disguise but I think it'll have the same effect.
I know what he said, but I'm not sure if cooking really takes out all of the forbidden.
Is it too late to order pumpkin?
Oh, all right. If it's a peach cobbler...
Well he didn't say anything about baking them...
It's covered up, but it's still tempting.
I would like to try the cheesecake instead.
How did you learn to make apple pie? Oh, yeah, the Tree of Knowledge!
Try it, it's positively sinful.
I know we can't eat the fruit... but they didn't say anything about pie!
I ordered more ribs.
I can smell the sin o'men
Eve, you are leading me to temptation again.
I guess I'll never know until I've tried it.
Now, it's a metaphor.
Wow. Humanity's first half-baked idea.
You've upped your game.
The Lord will certainly punish us for eating the fruit of... Oh My God, I love pie!
Why did god make carbs so tempting?
Did you make that?
Paradise lost, Geometry found 3.14159...
You wouldn't deceiveth me, would you Eve?
Any chance of getting a scoop of vanilla?
Forbidden fruit pie, you shouldn't have!
My mother was right about you.
I knew you had a mother.
I'm telling dad.
The snake says that it's okay as long as it's cooked.
And you bake?
The apples are organic and the crust is gluten-free, so what could possibly go wrong?
Oh, sweetie, you shouldn't have!
When jeopardizing all of humankind is the best way to get out of your relationship
So, uhh, that looks a lot more tempting.
I thought we were having ribs?
Don't take this the wrong way. That pie smells great, but, where are your nipples?
I'm so stoned and I don't have a fork.
Forbidden Fruit Pie? Sounds tempting!
Great idea, this should take care of that apple problem.
Just like Grandma used to -- oh wait, I don't have one.
I hope that's mock apple
Better than Rhubarb; who told you that?
Look babe, I love your pies, but I'm just not so sure about this one
Blueberry or cherry?
It doesn't smell like peaches.
Smells too good to be true - perhaps it is fake knowledge.
A strict constructionist might have a problem with this.
Eve, are you sure this doesn't count?
Well, if you say it's paleo...
Motherhood and apple pie? He should have no problem with that.
Well, since you brought the rib(s) the least I could do is bring an apple pie
I think I remember God saying something about No Carbs.
Mom?
Is apple piety more reverent than normal piety?
Well, technically it's not an apple so I guess it's OK.
You've gone too far.
I didn’t hear Him say anything about forbidden fruit PIE either.
You've got to try this, it's sinfully Delicious
Please tell me that the apples were not locally sourced.
I'd rather not KNOW what's in it, if you KNOW what I mean.
Not bad for never having touched an apple.
Eve, a pie is not going to change my life. . . This one will, Adam, trust me.
But is it organic?
It better not be apple
They do say if life gives you forbidden fruit, make pie, right?
I shouldn't, I just started this new Paleo diet.
Amazing! She even cooks!
I hope you're not ribbing me.
A pious woman.
Oh, the temptation! The temptation!
I should build a window sill to let it cool.
Two questions, where did you find the oven and where did you find the ingredients?
Come to think of it, I am dying for a piece!
Put my what where?
Nice try, Eve, but it's still an apple.
Just like my mother would have made...if I had had one.
I was really hoping for cherry.
Again?
C'mon, stick to His script, Eve.
So you really think God won't know?
We're having neighbours?!
Well, I suppose that might be one way to get around it.
If they're baked, does it still count?
What's the filling?
This could be a tasty loop hole.
we had apples last night.
So, baking makes it okay?
It's made with organic apples--I swear.
Does this mean you're not a virgin?
Mmmm. That smells like an apple pie to die for.
Is it guilt-free?
It's forbidden, but he says its artisanal
I'm not looking for a serious relationship right now.
Well, okay, but only because my attorney backs me up in believing there's a loophole.
I just can't resist apple pie.
But carbs and sugar are forbidden!
I said Shake-n-Bake not Snake and Bake
You really think this will fool him?
Too many carbs. Got an apple?
The first attempt at solving pie.
He said take, not bake!
Not to worry, Eve. Someone told me that two wrongs make a right.
Nietzsche was right: underlying the distinction between good and evil is the distinction between sweet and savory!
Have you seen my fig leaf?
Honey, I was being figurative
Probably OK, he said an apple not a pie.
3.14159?
Ok. I'll try it. Don't have a hissy fit.
is it homemade or heaven sent?
" What is that wicked smell"?
Apple pie? But I fancied ribs …
My. That does smell sinfully delicious!
I don't care how you hide it, it's still forbidden.
So... You did what with the apple?
I'm thinking fruit pie won't have the Forbidden ring to it that Genesis needs.
Ooo -- homemade?
We're being thrown out of paradise anyway
I'm afraid He'll know they're in there.
That's not the kind of pie I had in mind.
Perhaps a raw apple would be more epic.
Do you think a pecan pie constitutes a loophole?
And on the sixth day, God created gluten allergies.
This complicates things.
Well done Eve. Now invent ice cream.
When life gives you apples, make pie.
McIntosh or Granny Smith?
I don't think you're going to fool him with this stunt.
That's going to throw a monkey wrench in the Bible
What's a Bake Sale?
I better not. I'm allergic to fig leaves.
So you're saying, an apple in pie does not defy?
I dunno, He was pretty clear about that 'no gluten' thing.
You're sure there are no apples in there?
That looks great, Eve darling, but didn't the ribs fill you up?
Strawberry-rhubarb? Are you sure?
Huh? Your mother's recipe?
So I eat your pie and then put a bun in the oven?
I told Jim and Glenda that we were bringing the wine.
Just a whiff of that makes me realize we're naked...and you have smallish breasts.
Are you sure it's just an alternative apple?
Got milk?
He's right, technically, we're aren't eating an apple. Should be okay.
That looks heavenly.
"Sweetie, the aroma is so sinfully enticing. '
So original sin is really baked in?
Well, aren't we fancy!
And thus, baking was mankind's original sin
Now you're just trolling him.
Blueberry ? I love blueberry pie !
I love it, but won't He suspect we picked the apples?
Is this one off the forbidden menu?
Looks delicious, but where did you find the apples?
Heirloom apples?
Uh, are you sure that baking kills all the forbidden in the fruit?
The baking makes the taste good, but doesn't seem to remove the overall evil.
Please tell me it's a blueberry pie
Did you know this place has an oven?
What's in it? Or shouldn't I ask?
Looks sinfully good!
You must be ribbing me, it can't possibly be just like "mother used to make".
Fig Leaves Pie? You used our clothes?
From my grandmother? What the hell is a grandmother?
Now I really have a craving for ribs...
I hope that's mock apple pie.
My God, that pie smells Originally Sin-tillating.
Made with fruit from the alternative tree of knowledge, you say. Don't see any harm in that.
Mmm that is tasty , BTW did you know that you are naked ?
Maybe we should just stick with pumpkin.
"Eat of the tree..." This is kind of a gray area, isn't it?
I'm afraid to ask you where you got the apples.
I guess you misunderstood me when I said I'd love to eat your pie.
That better be a cherry pie.
You've invented loophole pie? What's in it?
That'd better be strawberry rhubarb or so help me Dad...
You were warned. You were given an explanation. Nevertheless you persist.
Are you sure they're organic?
You really know my weak spots!
It looks so good it's sinful.
Tempting, but I'm full.
Well . . . if the snake said, "That's how you make peach cobbler," I guess we're OK.
It's not the fruit I'm worried about. It's the gluten.
I guess I could be tempted with a slice.
Trust me. It's gluten-free.
Though the pie flew in the face of God, Adam ate, believing that Eve would be less forgiving.
Lemme guess. Apple?
Please tell me that it's blueberry!
Please -- tell me you didn't cook the goose.
That's mighty tempting.
It's tempting. But lets have sex first.
If only the path to a man's heart was through his stomach.
Really? It's not a sin, if the crust is thin?
Hope this knowledge isn't half-baked!
I am just asking who you got the recipie from?
Now that's very tempting, indeed.
Well, I guess apple PIE is ok...
Hot tart?
What? Your Mother's favorite recipe?
Oh, please tell me that's a cherry pie...
I didn't know there was more than one apple.
Is there ice cream?
I've met someone else.
Is it apple? Cuz...
You say it's an old family recipe.
I would be more tempted with a scoop of ice cream on the side.
Is it still a sin if its baked?
So that's what you did with my apple!
As long as it's American, it must be OK.
Please tell me its a cheery pie
So you don't think it counts if the apples have been cooked?
I thought we were having ribs?
Still Life of Pie
First it was apple sauce, then apple strudel. When will you give up?
Dear God, please let it be anything but apple pie.
Tempting, but I'm on the paleo diet, babe.
I only eat Paleo.
I think we're gonna need a to-go box.
Apple pie? How tempting!
Are you sure it's okay to eat dessert first?
So you're saying it's not apples. It's an alternative fact called a pie?
Please tell me that's pumpkin pie?
But only if the apples are organic.
God, I hope that's blueberry
What do you mean by alternative apple?
I really shouldn't eat that without pants.
Pumpkin? . . .Cherry? . . .Blueberry?
When there are more people we can open a pie shop.
Well it certainly smells tempting
"So. do you think this is safer than right off the tree?
Well sure, I love apple pie Eve. But if God doesn't buy the talking snake story, it's all going to be your fault.
Well, He never said we couldn't bake with the apples...
And He said it's alright as long as we save Him a piece?
My secret ingredient is original cinnamon.
I'd try the apple, but the gluten is a problem for me.
Wow, nude pizza delivery, I am in Heaven.
Okay, but I don't think He's going to let us get away with it.
You're sure this way it's guilt- and gluten-free?
Smell soo good its sinful
No thank you, I'm paleo.
Are there peanuts in it?
I think you are going to regret this someday.
Was it "You shall surely die" or "You shall surely diet"?
Can't we just skip the dessert?
Of course it's for you. Who else is there?
Wait. I don't think He said it was "for baking" fruit.
It's tempting, but I think I'll pass.
Really--mock apple pie?
You say cherry but it smells an awful lot like apple.
The Garden of Eatin'
God says "no," yet you persist.
God said nothing about forbidden fruit pie...
I was hoping for ribs
Well, he didn't say anything about eating apple pie.
So you're sure that baking it in the pie is okay?
Four and twenty BLACKBIRDS??? I ordered Apple!
You invited WHO to dinner?!
No -- we're ok. It's gluten free.
And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Just grab it.
Would you like a piece?
Is this from the tree of knowledge?
We better make that order To Go.
I sure hope it's blueberry.
where did you ever learn how to make an apple pie?
Honey, you know what God said about gluten!
Wow, it doesn't look like an apple anymore!
I think he said touching the apple would make Allah mad, not à la mode.
Wow! You learned how to bake and all you did was taste an apple? Sure I'll try one. What do I have to lose?
She told us not to use Her pie plate!
after we have the pie, i feel like going shopping for pants.
Rubarb, I hope.
Devil's Food pie?
Did you use original cinnamon?
Tempting but I'm doing a gluten-free thing now.
Did you get that recipe from the Tree of Knowledge?
And Mankind was spared a fall because Adam and Eve were totally off gluten that week.
Let's do it again before He responds.
He's asking whether you tasted any of those apples before you baked them!
I don't suppose that's a cherry pie?
No matter how you sugar coat it, this will not end well
Just a quick nosh … what could it hurt?
Wait, where did you get the knowledge to bake?
Goddamn that looks good.
What's rhubarb?
I sense that you two are cooking something up against me.
Another half-baked alternative fact?
...but I asked God to make me a tart?
No thanks, Eve. I'm paleo.
Personally, I would have gone with a lattice crust.
How did you figure out how to make it?
Your pie looks delicious as sin!!
Since they were on the ground .... I think they will be OK.
it doesn't count if it's baked.
You said the apples are locally sourced?
Bake. Snake. I feel a song comin' on.
This is for the ribs.
Original Tin
No thanks. I’m on the paleo diet.
Um, I just got a call. We're moving.
I see what you did there.
Baking it isn't going to help.
You didn't put raisins in it, did you?
If that's from 'all-natural ingredients,' we're in trouble.
Well, I guess we couldn't get any more naked or shamed.
Well, he didn't say anything about apple pie!
uh, 3.14159...
Let's taste one of the apples first. You never know.
A little known fact - the oven was invented before clothing.
I don't think I can eat an anachronism.
Technically it is a pie now and not an apple.
He's okay with the apples, but said the soggy crust is unforgivable.
Uh thanks, but apple?
I feel like someone is watching us.
If you had vanilla ice cream, I'd agree with the serpent.
It's tempting but something tells me I should take a pass.
I hope it's blueberry.
There may be an aftertaste.
Another Sinterest recipe?
And it was good.
Oh, hell....I give up.
Your first clue something was wrong should have been when the snake said it was a recipe for a pie like grandma used to make.
That looks totally sinful.
Are you sure there are no apples in the pie?
Oh wow, an Eve ORIGINAL CINammon apple pie!
Mom?
Did that snake just spit on my head?
I'm not sure cooking the apples makes it any better
Let me get this straight, you've found an alternative fact for avoiding eternal sin?
Actually I wanted a pizza pie.
For God's sake, I asked for an angel food cake!
It sure smells like apple to me?
If I eat only the crust, will we still get kicked out of the garden?
Wish I could, but I'm on the Paleo.
You couldn't have used my mother's recipe.
I have this sudden, overwhelming desire to call you "Mom".
I forget. Was it cherries or apples we are forbidden to eat?
Bye bye Mesoamerican pie...
Please be blueberry.
But it's still apple!
Uhh... not sure covering the apples is gonna fool him.
Babe, I thought we agreed on this paleo diet thing.
Something is telling me it's apple...
Where'd you get the peaches?
I can't. My snake has me on a paleo diet.
But are you absolutely certain they're organic?
Is it gluten-free?
Well it really smells great, but I'm doing this paleo thing right now...
If you're going to mess up humanity forever, it might as well be apple PIE.
Kinda hoping that's not apple
Dammit, where are Ben and Jerry when you need them?!
Please tell me that's strawberry-rhubarb.
Since it's apple, I suppose just a piece.
I mean, I guess it's vegan, so it's gotta be okay...
He was really mad this time. I think it's going to take more than just a pie.
Apple again Eve?
For God's sake, tell me that's rhubarb.
We'll have to wrap it to go.
Oh wait, does that have gluten?
I love how you make knowledge so irresistible...
Baked into a cobbler? Will this paradise ever end?
Whoa…bad timing…I just started the Garden of Eden Beach Diet.
That's awfully nice, but just an apple would have been enough.
Pumpkin? Pecan?
Who's recipe did you use?
God says we have eat our broccoli first.
So good it's sinful.
And you swear it's gluten-free?
I thought pie are square.
Don't tempt me - I'm on the Paleo Diet.
I must say Eve, your baked goods are very tempting.
Please tell me it's not apple.
Should I make coffee?
Is this going to be like having your pie and eating it, too?
But, Eve, why would you change your name to Sara Lee?
Now it's just a peach pie...right?
Original sin, or original recipe?
Oh, please tell me that's a cherry pie...
Look Adam, this isn't the forbidden fruit. It's an alternative fact.
No, I don’t want to be your taste tester.
You want me to stick my WHAT into that?
Sorry, I’m gluten free. Now if you had just a plain old apple, I'd bite that….
I get what you're saying, honey, but we're still violating the [ital] spirit [/ital] of the law.
What, dessert before the ribs?
Apple, again?
You couldn't pick the blueberry of knowledge?
You're sure it's a cherry pie?
Oh Dear, you baked the original sin!
I keep hearing a voice telling me to shun the apples and stay on my diet.
Eve, you made my favorite...Apple SINamon Pie!
That's a chicken pot pie, right?
It's knowledge-flavored.
Oh, Eve, the calories alone are sinful.
That's a helluva pie.
You sure you were allowed to use that pan?!
Do you have knowledge of the word 'no'?
A tempting dessert?
Fresh baked from the kosher deli - what could go wrong?
Sorry babe, I'm doing Paleo.
So, let me get this straight...the 'alternative fact' version will be more digestible?
Does that make us Americans now?
Right, apple pie is not an apple; we should be fine.
Hey, wait a minute. Isn't this form over substance?
Smells delicious. Where did you get the apples?
When Adam didn't fall for the apple, Eve tried a different ploy.
So Trump says this is Cherry Pie?
No thanks, I've got a restrictive deity.
Where the hell did you bake that?
Did you sell our clothes to buy an oven?
OMG, wasn't motherhood supposed to come first?
Thats the fake kind made with Ritz crackers, right?
Ok, you can bake a pie. How are you at doing the laundry?
Tell your mother thank you but I am in enough trouble already.
I guess I would be anti-American not to eat it.
Do you think it's still forbidden if it's baked?
He didn't mention anything about apple pie.
So you're pretty sure that in a pie it's not that big of a deal?
Devil's food only in cake, right?
That smells positively sinful!
That looks sinfully good.
Is it home made?
I take it back; it was totally worth it.
Hmm..er...Has God created vanilla ice-cream yet?
Four and twenty blackbirds? That's not quite what I was expecting.
You used our last apple to make a pie?
I think someone's trying to tempt us.
I'm ready for a piece, all right ...
Well, this better be good.
I can't be tempted unless its gluten-free.
And then I'm supposed to say we found it?
Please tell me that's not locally sourced.
Let's see. Defy God...Invent fire... What's next?
Too many more of these and I might start feeling ashamed to be naked.
Don't tell me. It's apple.
I got the idea from Food Network...and Satan.
Why not, technically it's not an apple.
Adam never had a chance against Eve's temptations.
No, I think the apples are fine, its the gluten I'm worried about.
Dessert first?
Wow, a homemade pie. Next, you'll be sewing your own clothes!
Try the pie. It;s to die for.
Are the apples in there locally grown?
You didn't bite the apple?
He had me at ribs.
It’s tempting, but sugar tops my list of forbidden foods.
Well, if you're sure it's MOCK apple pie.
Pretty sure He recommended humble pie. This smells like Knowledge.
That looks to die for!
But how did you bake it?
Tell me it's persimmons.
Don't you think blueberry might be better?
In the interest of full disclosure, I took a small bite out of one before you made the pie......
Wait. What ARE Alternative Apples?
What do you mean, "You'll know it when I try it?"
My favorite! How did you know?
First ribs, now apple pie. What's next?
Eve, your apple pie is tempting, but it's still forbidden.
I'm confused........ your mother's recipe?
Eat it? Wow, I totally misunderstood.
How would we know whether it is good or bad?
I was expecting to meet someone named Eve -- not Martha.
It's totally worth it.
'Please tell me that's not what I think it is'
I'd be tempted if it were A La Mode.
So this is really MOCK apple pie?
Is that store-bought?
Apple, plus sugar and fat. This will send us straight to hell.
Where did you find an oven in this place?
Adam's apple
You know what would be really nice? You learning to dress like a woman.
It's ok, it's cherry.
It smells like my tree of the knowledge of good and evil scented body wash.
So it's made with saltines and just tastes like apples?
Oh, sorry honey. Snake and I grabbed a bite on the way home.
Swear to God its Mock Apple?
Holy goodbye paradise, Eve! Please, tell me that's blueberry!!
I still think we're not supposed to eat it.
We'll need bigger fig leaves after that!
I dunno...maybe we should run this past the Ninth Circuit.
That's true. He wasn't very clear on rhubarb, was he?
Hmm, that's makes them even more tempting.
Apple? Tempting, but I'll pass.
I always get in trouble with desserts.
Which tree did the fruit come from?
"I hope it is apple!
I'll just have an apple. I'm off carbs.
I hope you didn't bake out ALL the sin.
Apple pie! Very tempting.
You used canned apples, right?
WAIT, Let me guess: Apple Pie?
They're no apples in it, right?
I guess as long as the apples are fallen, we won't be banished.
Please tell me that is a pecan pie. He didn't mention pecans.
And you say it's peach, right?
Would it be a sin to ask God for some ice cream on the side?
Is that from the Tree of Knowledge of Gluten Evil?
Are you sure baked apples don't count?
He says it's guilt-free.
If anything could make the fall from grace worth it, it's apple pie.
I baked a pie. Your Dad's coming
Is that original cinnammon I smell?
and my second question is where do babies come from?
Did the serpent also help you bake that?
When the devil gives you apples...
You really think it will make Eden great again?
Yeah, I still feel like this could be a lease violation...
You're comparing apples to apples again, dear.
Funny, you don't look American.
No, no, it's a pumpkin pie.
I am really hoping there are four-and-twenty black birds in there.
No, Eve, that tree was to give us PIETY!
I think I'd rather have the blueberry.
Sure, a piece of pie never hurt anyone…
Oh, darling. You shouldn't have.
Who got second place?
Don't worry, it's cherry.
Well, yes, He didn't say anything about apple PIE.
Looks good! Or maybe evil.
You'll have to tell me, because my mind is kind of a blank slate right now
Since it's already baked into the pie, . . .
Add a scoop of ice cream, then I'll be tempted!
Funny, it doesn't smell like rhubarb.
Sure I'll have some! What good is being naked if I don't know you're naked?
Devil to table?
As long as we're going to get thrown out of the garden anyway we might as well make the most of it.
Think He'll notice?
You say that knowledge is packed into every delicious bite?
Let me guess, apple pie?
Wow, that looks divine!
Apple pie will be the downfall of my diet and what else?
Why settle for a bite of the apple when you can have the entire pie ?
"Wow, Honey, you can cook, too!
It's Mom's Apple Pie, what could go wrong?
When you're done, find something to wear
Angel food pie? You sure about that?
This feels naughty.
When you said, "would like some pie?" I had something totally different in mind.
God only knows how you baked that pie!
So you're saying it's only mock apple.
Goodbye missionary position!
So now you're cooking with alternative facts?
I'm into Paleo now. How about if we just eat some apples.
He didn't say anything about forbidden fruit pie!
It's not what you're thinking. It's strawberry rhubarb.
'Alternative apples,' huh?
You made that from scratch?
Something tells me I'll regret this.
It's not the fruit that worries me, it's the gluten.
Though he thought the idea half-baked, Adam ate, hoping to avoid the torment of hearing about that infernal pie for eternity.
Wow, this is really going to mess with exegesis in a couple of millennia.
Wow, thank you Eve! That looks sinful!
Oh thanks so much, but, really, an apple would have been just fine.
Are you sure it doesn't count if they're baked?
Has anyone ever called you an overachiever?
Refined sugar -- that will go down as the original sin.
This isn't just any pie, Adam. But I gotta tell ya, the Devil's in the details.
He said "a pie is OK?"
God's gonna be pissed that you took that off his windowsill.
Humble pie? How tempting.
Let me guess... apple pie? Eve, enough with the apples already. Seriously.
Quit tempting me, Eve! You know I can't keep my hands off apple pie.
Please tell me you used the leftover figs!
The critics will kill us. They didn't have ovens back then.
I suppose a little slice couldn't hurt.
Is there any bacon in it?
Did you just say, "alternative apple pie"?
I just can't. I 'm against that silly rule, too. But if we get caught gaming the system, we're gonna lose everything.
I don't know, Eve. We could be playing with fire.
Not apple I hope
From your mouth to God's ire.
I'd rather have a date.
Would I be eating this for recreational or medicinal purposes?
You didn't have to go to all that trouble. An apple would've been just fine.
Can I have it a la mode?
I still think we're going to get in trouble.
Are we expecting company?
Hey serpent, are you sure this doesn't count?
You made that from scratch?
Original sinfully delicious
Sugar-free or not, it just feels wrong.
WOW! This will make you famous for a long time.
I still think this is a half baked idea.
How should I know if it smells "good"?
Know your facts! These aren't forbidden; they're alternative apples.
Rhubarb? Should be okay.
He can't say that the pie came from the tree...
...and you're absolutely sure this is a cherry pie?
I AM tempted, Eve, but I just started my Paleo Diet!
And you're sure it's food for the soul?
We might as well make the best of it
Original Sin(ful Desserts)
Look at what's on the menu for the fall.
Must you constantly remind me?
Do I want to know what is in it?
Mom's apple pie. What a funny name.
I guess the knowing will be in the tasting. . .
I don't want to take the chance of getting kicked out if it's plain old apple.
Never would have thought of THAT on my own!
Smells wonderful! Should I ask what's in it, or is ignorance Bliss?
I think writing, "Then adam sat down and ate bite after bite of the delicious hand-made pie," really complicates the story line.
I see the pie, now let me see those buns.
The Genesis of Gluten Intolerance
It looks American, so it's probably okay to let it in.
Tell me that's not APPLE pie.
Peach pie, I hope.
Again with the apples?
You didn't have peaches?
It doesn't make me feel guilty, but I feel guilty for not feeling guilty.
Hmmmmm........after you, Eve!
I guess we haven't learned subtlety yet.
Apple Pie this good must be a sin
I don't know where to begin.
Couldn't we, uh, just keep things status quo?
Hmm, I think we will call this one, "Loophole."
Really? Ritz crackers?
Uh...you don't seem to get it.
Origin of the obese species
Blueberry again? What did you do with the apple?
What do you mean " sinfully delicious"?
I suddenly can't think of anything to say that's not filthy.
I know it's fattening, but we all have our guilty pleasures.
You're right, he didn't say anything about not eating apple pie!
With my snake and your pie, the captions are endless.
I'm not sure baking it into a pie gets around His prohibition.
They say the way to a man's soul is through his stomach
Technically, He didn't mention pie.
Is it still a fruit if it's cooked?
I thought you were getting ribs?
Sure it's all-American, but one bite and we'll be hit with a heckuva travel ban.
Tempting, but I'm paleo.
What's rhubarb?
The Original Recipe
Did you make that yourself?
I'm not sure making the apple into a pie gets us off the hook.
Devil's fool cake.
. . . okay. Just as long as it is not an apple pie.
Seriously? What's next, ribs?
Shame on us if we don't give it a taste
Rhubarb doesn't count, right?
Smells sinfully delicious -- whatever that means.
Is it apple?
How did you keep it from falling?
I hope it tastes like Mom's apple pie....Hold a second?
Well, it doesn't appear to violate the letter of the law, so, sure! What's the worst that could happen?!
Only if the crust is made from scratch.
I'm tempted, but it seems half-baked.
Do you think he'll figure it out?
Geez, Eve, you know I could never resist your Forbidden Fruit pie.
Well, yes, smelling the apples isn't technically forbidden.
It's an original recipe and it's sinfully delicious
Wait, tell me again what makes someone an American?
My attorney says it will be okay.
Please tell me it's a chicken pot pie.
I made it from scratch
Saying it's rhubarb is not an alternative fact.
If I had to guess, I'd say "apple" and then "3.1415926.)
I don't think your mother made this.
And to top it all off, you baked it in the Forbidden Oven in the Never Go Anywhere Near This Kitchen?
Fresh out of the what now?
No thanks. Rather have another prime rib.
Devils Food Pie? Sorry Eve, I'm not biting.
It's not like a real apple, I think it should be okay?
I don't have a problem with it as long as He doesn't.
The snake said, "there's no such thing as a free lunch."
I spy with my little eye trouble hiding in this pie.
Blueberry?
I thought we were having creme brulee for dessert?
Nevermind, I'll have cherry.
I still think that counts as eating the fruit.
You swear to God there are no apples in there?
Looks like you cooked the hell out of those apples.
Not those apples?
Ah, which fruit did you use in this again?
That pie smells so good, it might be worth getting banished.
Are you sure this is from a pie tree?
So, I get total knowledge AND US citizenship?
Please tell me that's not apple pie.
Wow, thanks, but it's still sin.
Did you use real original cinnamon?
'Thanks, but I just started the Paleo diet.'
Kale pie again? Can't you make one with apple or anything sweeter?
Are you sure it's a mock apple pie?
Ice cream....I knew I forgot something.
Your mother's recipe?
Well, I guess He never said pie was forbidden.
So, you're saying it's in the spirit if not the letter?
Do you promise it's Kosher?
Yeah, maybe, Eve...He didn't actually SAY baked fruit ...
Think whipped cream is forbidden, too?
No thanks. I'm gluten-free.
Apple pie? And where is America
It's not the apple. I'm off gluten.
Wait a second... What kind of pie is that?
Blueberry? Pumpkin? Peach?...Oh, just tell me!
Something so American can't be sinful, right?
I think you're right. He didn't say anything about forbidden fruit filling. Let's eat!
Gee, I hope that's not apple.
Well, as long as they're organic it's probably ok
I think I'd like the snake to taste it first, if you don't mind
That snake is really persuasive!
I really don't think THE MAN is going to appreciate your creativity.
I like the new take on date night
I guess I just interpreted things differently.
Trust me, it's peach.
Yes, I am a locavore.
I'll see you in hell.
I know the serpent says forget about the carbs but...
I hid the evidence.
Another one of your half-baked ideas?
Adam was reluctant to eat the forbidden fruit pie…partly for fear of banishment from the Garden of Eden and partly for the three hundred calories per slice.
Why not? We sure liked what Serpent taught us about grapes.
Asp, and you shall receive.
Is it ethically sourced?
Well, there's no shame in pie.
Don't tell me. It's apple.
...but without a dab of French Vanilla and no digestif, no vermouth, it just feels wrong...
It's better than a cigarette.
I hope that's a cherry pie.
I'll guess apple!
Gosh. For goodness sake...you shouldn't have.
I'm gluten free. Do you have just a plain apple?
We're cooked now!
"I still don't understand what you mean by alternative facts.'
I always thought it would be hot and steamy.
Love how it makes the whole firmament smell good.
I'm sure I said pumpkin.
This is the mock-apple pie made with Ritz crackers, isn't it?
I didn't know we had an Oven of Knowledge.
I thought it was gonna be a piece of cake.
Forbidden Fruits of the Forest pie sounds good to me!
A recipe from the cookbook of Genesis? Tempting...
Are your ingredients locally sourced?
Are you sure it's rhubarb?
Don't worry...It isn't apple.
This is not how we are supposed to sin.
So, it shall bring onto this World woe, sin, and her shadow Death, but, boy, pie is worth it.
Good disguise, but it's still an apple.
Is the crust gluten-free?
I think I’ll go with a fig leaf.
Blueberry? I think that's OK. God, I hope so.
I know what God said, but there are also alternative facts.
It's organic!
My pies are up here pal.
You're not Eve! I must be in Heaven!
That doesn't look like Devil's Food cake.
You sure that's a cherry pie?
Tempting, but I'm watching my carbs.
You know how to bake?
Are you sure it's rhubarb?
Psst. You can blame her for your weight problem, too.
I'm just not into Granny Smith
Baked and Afraid
Is that the pie from Mrs. Ssssssmith?
Sorry I would, but I just had an apple
I forgot to tell you about my apple allergy.
I'd love some but I'm watching my sin
What do you mean exactly when you say, 'It's good'?
No need for subterfuge. It's just an allegory.
That's a completely different question.
Where did you get the apples?
OMG It smells like apple and I am so tempted.
I guess it's OK if it's in a pie.
I'm not going to ask how you baked that.
It smells great, but you know carbs are forbidden.
Apple pie? I'm confused...does this make you wholesome or wicked?
For heaven's sake Gloria, didn't that one bite cause enough trouble!
I am really tired of this snake referring to itself in the third person.
Umm... let's keep this pie off the record.
Betty who?
Is the forbidden fruit organic?
Gosh, I don't know. I just started that paleo diet.
So, you say it's from The Garden of Eatin'?
Is that paleo?
Oh darn! He told me we can't heat the forbidden fruit.
THAT grew on the tree? Hey, you ever wonder if God might want us to fail?
If life gives you apples, make apple pie.
I would have settled for toast with half an avocado.
Wow, just like Mom used to make, whatever that means.
Eve, I think you were not properly vetted before allowing you to immigrate to the Garden of Eden.
Hope it's not apple!
Ah! This explains the rolling pin.
I don't know, but doesn't baked forbidden fruit seem sort of like fake news?
Is this pie with benefits?
I checked online. It says fruit of this particular tree is safe to partake of so long as it's baked in the oven at 325
You didn't have to do that. You know you're the only girl for me.
What exactly are "alternative apples?"
OK, so I get the pie, then you get everything?
Well. ok, if you're sure it's gluten-free...
Try this instead.
Really, the lovemaking was quite enough.
Well, as long as there was an executive order, I guess it's OK.
I hope that's pecan,
You say this apple pie could be a real eye opener?
So a pastry is not a fruit?
Well there goes my paleo diet.
GEE, I'VE NEVER HAD AN APPLE PIE BEFORE.
Well,he did say don't bite.He didn't say don't bake.
Please tell me the apples were from the farmer's market...
I can't just eat the crust?
He never said we couldn't make a forbidden fruit pie.
I've told you: not Paleo, not tempted.
Are you sure the knowledge cooked off in the oven?
What's a window sill ?
I see that they now deliver below 14th Street.
Gluten-free you say....
Is this connected with your being sick recently in the morning?
You really think this is gunna fool Him?
God works in mysterious ways.
I assume it's cherry.
I guess I'll take the blame.
Are you sure it's the Devil's Food Cake that's forbidden?
Considering what's at stake, let's just take a minute and think this through: if it's peeled, sliced, enclosed in a shell of buttered dough and baked into an aromatic and heavenly crust - is it still technically an apple?
Banana cream, I hope.
Any chance of getting that à la mode?
Are you sure this is the one with no forbidden fruit?
You're putting a lot of pressure on me.
Okay. I give up!
Well, He didn't say we couldn't have cooked apple.
You were warned, but you're persisting.
There's no harm in taking a small bite of this sinfully delicious apple pie.
Been there, done that.
It doesn't count if they're cooked.
Wait. Remind me again. Do we both have pie holes?
Now you're just being a jerk.
Do you have a healthier choice?
I suppose it's better than ribs.
"It looks tempting but is it gluten free?
Oh, that smells delicious! What's in it?
Sweet Christ, please tell me that is a peach cobbler.
That better be blueberry.
Hmm, Is that really kosher?
You had me at 'apple'.
Sorry, I'm like really into the paleo diet these days...
Will you try it first? You know how the last one turned out...
It's tempting, but I really must watch what I eat.
My eve, how we've evolved!
What are we celebrating?
Just like Mom never made.
Are you sure it's organic?
Can I pretend and say it's just like my mother's?
Is it as good as mom's?
If it tastes as good as it smells, you'll be famous!
Enough with the ribs, thought we could try a pie for a change.
Hmm, I did notice we are four and twenty blackbirds short.
It looks and smells delicious, but is it banish-worthy?
Sorry. Can't. I'm gluten free.
Are you sure the disguise will work?
So this is from an old family recipe?
You didn't.
There is always a new form of temptation
I hope it's not blackbirds, again!
Oh God, apple pie.
I trust that's blueberry.
Your euphemism is tempting.
It's not the apples I'm worried about, it's the glutin.
Didn't I mention that I'm gluten intolerant?
You baked me a sin?!
Gotta watch my weight. How 'bout an apple?
Who repaired the oven?
Oy! Now for the rewrite.
Great! This looks a lot better than that silly fruit from a tree.
If I eat it I won't fit into my clothes. If I don't eat it I won't know about clothes. What to do, what to do...
Dear God that smells good.
Cloves. Allspice. And...sin! I definitely smell sin!
I'm not getting kicked out of here for one of your pies...
Let me guess…strawberry/rhubarb?
Sin never tasted so sweet.
forbidden fruit pie?
If I'd known you were coming, I'd have baked a cake!
I think we should get a second opinion.
I like it here, so I hope that's not apple.
You found it on a window sill? What’s a window sill?
It is not an apple pie, is it?
I didn't know that this was the Garden of Eatin'!
Nothing is more tempting than apple pie. Nothing. - Adam
I hear sex feels like warm apple pie.
Oh, I can never resist a flaky crust.
Wait, what was it we were warned against? Gluten?
Fig pie lowers my libido.
So, you think God would get mad if we asked for forks?
I said I wanted to fuck your pie hole, not eat your pie whole.
Great! We'll call it pizza.
You really can't spell paradise without pie
The recipe is Original.
Are you sure it's kosher?
I think alternate apples would be OK.
Oh wait. Let me guess!
Devil's Food Pie just doesn't sound right.
I think you misunderstood my meaning.
Holy snake! You just got the apple and you already baked a pie. You are an angel.
Damn, I forgot to pickup the ice cream!
No thanks, I'm on a Paleo diet.
So you say you baked the sin out of it?
I don't know. One bad apple could spoil everything.
Is it still forbidden if it's baked?
Disguising it as a pie doesn't mean it's not forbidden
I must have the wrong garden!
No honey, I think we should use that in the sequel!
If it was a la mode, now that would be tempting.
Oh hon, I meant to tell you I'm doing paleo now!
Now, who did you say you got the recipe from?
Take God's word seriously, not literally.
The snake said we couldn't eat apples, but it didn't say we couldn't eat apple pie.
Lead us not into temptation. Oh forget it, I know a shortcut.
I'm sure it doesn't apply to me.
I hope that's not an apple pie.
Can't we just watch a movie or something?
Wait, I have to choose?
Is that Kosher?
But is it organic?
Smells awesome; but will God see it as an acceptable loophole?
This better not be the same pie that got us kicked out of the garden
You say the recipe's from Sinterest?
Lilith uses rhubarb.
Wait- did He say pious or pie us?
Really? Apple? Again?
Are you sure Breitbart said apple pies don't have real apples?
Hmm, he didn't say anything about apple pie.
I promised I'd be good today.
Uh, let me guess, apple?
Well if it's just alternative apples, then okay.
It's vegan, gluten free & sugar free - surely no harm can come our way now.
Are you sure it's cherry?
Is this thing organic?
Oh let me guess. Blueberry?
I don't care who thought of it. Give me a huge piece.
Is that all we're Eden today?
I get the sneaking suspicion you should've baked the snake instead.
Since the apple has been deconstructed, it doesn't count, right?
what gave you the recipe for this fruit pie?
No matter how you slice it, Eve, no dessert is absolutely guilt free
I thought gluten free was forbidden.
It was made from scratch.
You want me to stick in my WHAT?
Carbs: The Original Sin
Would you like a piece?
What kind?
Oh, Eve... you really shouldn't have.
I don't know. Are you sure we're out of ice cream?
So tempting, but I just went gluten-free.
I'm more concerned about the forbidden gluten.
What's lemon meringue? Smells like apples.
My dear, your baking is as creative as your biblical interpretations.
"Well, I guess he did say 'fruit of the tree of knowledge', not 'baked goods from the shrub of yumminess'".
OK, as long as it's local.
I'm having a strange recollection of a mother I never knew.
I was hoping for more than a pie from this relationship.
Smells devilishy good!
''well one thing's for sure, this is not your mamas recipe''
Can I have that to go?
This is not your mom's apple pie.
Are you sure this is rhubarb pie?
Could be the work-around for the eons, sweetheart!
Are we still in trouble if we don't eat it?
Hmmm...there may be an executive order prohibiting this...
I don't know Eve. Were they organic apples you used?
Pie are squared. What's that supposed to mean?
Julia Child IS god!
no, no trust me it's rhubarb
I'll just have one bite I suppose.
Voted best dessert in the Old Testament... so I was told.
I don't think it matters that it's gluten-free.
you say peach, but it smells like apple to me.
Hmm, will He know what's inside the pie?
I prefer blueberry over forbidden fruit.
Wow, whose mom made the pie!
It's called a knish
Tempting, but I'm paleo.
A la mode? That would make it too sinful."
Got milk?
No thank you. I'm trying to cut carbs
Oh God, I really wish I could, but I've gone off gluten!
It's tempting, but I'm cutting back on carbs.
I'm sorry apple was all we had
Thanks, but I'm pretty sure I'd get kicked out for doing that.
Four and twenty blackbirds or eternal temptation?
This'll be the day that I die.
Well, He didn't say anything say anything about baking.
FAKE NEWS via GENESIS
I just remember her crust being flakier.
perhaps with a slice of cheddar.
Unless you substituted four and twenty blackbirds for apple I think we'd still be busted out of here.
I'm not so sure...what is an oven?
Whoa, I just had the strangest dream...
Somehow I think cherry would be better.
It's blueberry you say?
You've outdone yourself, Eve! I can even smell the original cinnamon!
He didn't say anything about pastries.
So, you're absolutely sure there are no GMOs?
Processed food already?
You are an American?
You're sure it's a Samsung?
Honey you know I'm still on the paleo diet.
If I have a piece, will you sleep with me?
I'm going to make you an offer you can't refuse.
I'm not goin' down for mock apple!
That's really thoughtful, but I'm eating paleo.
Does that mean you'll do the cooking?
As long as that's not apple pie...
That's not apple, right?
There's something else I'd prefer you heat up.
Oh no Eve, now an apple pie, are you trying to kill me?
Whoa, not only are the apples on the list, so is the lard, the white sugar and the gluten.
Huh? I asked for the solution to Pi.
Oh no, we were supposed to eat just the apple!
The snake said we need whipped cream .
Why does it smell like knowledge of good and evil?
What do you mean taste it? I thought Pi was a number
Wow! Apple pie! Just like Mom used to bake. Wait. I don't have a mom.
Nice, but is it gluten-free?
Funny, but all I smell is fear.
You need a green card not an apple pie
That Apple pie is even hotter then you.
When did you find time to bake?
Are you sure that this is an acceptable work-around?
But I ordered pizza.
Is this a trick?
Ummm, has that pie gone through extreme vetting?
Better not. I'm gluten free.
Apples! How did you know?
My gluten sensitivity may end up saving humanity.
I can already feel the burn...
Can I have it ala sin?
Something tells me I've got a lot to learn.
Well, I suppose it's OK if it's cooked . . .
That looks sinful---oops, my bad
I'm at a loss as to who should take the first bite.
Let's face it...we're both piesexual.
I'm not sure. Did it come from the oven of good and evil?
I could've had a V8!
Go on, just try a small piece -- it's sinfully good.
And you have a bun in the oven?
Just take a hot bite and don't overthink it, dear. This one is filled with fruit from the Tree of Alternative Facts.
Apple, you say?
Okay, but where'd you get the Bisquick?
A moment on the lips, a lifetime on the bricks.
We were in trouble for picking the fruit, then you had to go and cut it up!
A naked woman with dessert and your complaining.
Apples again. You can't tempt me by hiding them in a pie.
No worries. As long as the apples are from Mar-a-Lago member countries, the ban does not apply.
--and you went forth and multiplied?
Are you sure? Look where "drink me" got us.
I guess they never said you couldn’t eat an apple pie.
Um, you don't need to compete with my Mom's cooking.
"Are you sure its peach pie"? Joyce Grimm, Pittsburgh. PA
He promises it's kosher
Now we have to leave the garden of eatin'
And the serpent says this solves the whole apple problem.
But we were told not to eat of the Tree of the Knowledge of Baked Goods and Evils.
Wait, is that made from my apple?
Now that's an original sin I can live with!
Original or extra crispy?
do you have any ice cream?
No, no, I said you're the apple of my eye. He wanted the pie.
Are you sure it's cherry?
Oh... pie.
They're right, you've come a long way.
Sinful? The crust is whole wheat.
And you promise it's gluten free?
It's organic apple! I heard it's good for you.
I'm tempted, but is it gluten-free?
But they say pie comes before a fall...
'' I hope that's a cherry pie. It's the only kind the snake will eat''
Oh please tell me that's a blueberry pie!
So, you ate the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Baking?
You're creeping me out.
It's tempting, but I prefer banana cream.
I get guilt free and gluten free confused.
Let me guess--is it apple?
To thank you for giving me your rib, I made you this apple pie!
Vegan, gluten-free, and what's the other thing?
Sorry, I'm gluten free
But I gave you my mother's recipe!
You baked what kind of pie?
You had to eat the apple to know how to cook it, right?
Do you remember what happened to the apples I was saving for eternal damnation?
What do you mean, "4 and 20"?
You're sure they were organic?
Well, we won't know if it's good until we try it.
Okay, what do you mean by Spare Ribs?."
'That better be four and twenty blackbirds.'
Wait...don't tell me...peach?
That better be cherry......
I think I like your first idea where we use fig leaves.
Did you bring the ice cream?
Is this a trick question?
Funny, it doesn't smell like peach pie.
What... you BAKED it... where did you get the fire?
It's tempting, but I can't. I'm on the Mediterranean diet.
No thanks, I am on a gluten free diet.
It's not a sin if it's cooked!
Apple sounds great, that lemon meringue was awful.
Wow, that looks almost as good as something my mom would bake, if I had a mom.
Blueberry ? Cherry ? No, No, you didn't.
Store-bought crust is a sin!
That better be strawberry rhubarb.
OK, it's not a rock, and it's not a goose... Look how am I supposed to guess this if I haven't eaten of the Tree of Knowledge?
I heard there was an oven but ---!
I am tempted to ask how you did this...........
I don't know -- blueberry pie is going to mess up the story.
With cane sugar?
I don't know, He says not to try anything that looks or smells delicious.
Does it count if they're baked?
It's our father's favorite!
Why did you double down on the apple?!
So, sugar is the new evil.
What do you mean, "It's okay because it's a GMO"?
Does it have tree nuts?
If it's organic, non-GMO, gluten-free, vegan and Paleo, why not eat it?
What? Original pie too?
Oh, sorry I'm on the paleo diet.
the fuck is that?
Okay, but it doesn't smell like rhubarb.
Temptation thy name is pie.
Very tempting....is it gluten free?
WE MUST BE IN AMERICA
Waitress, I've a premonition this will be to go.
hmmm...apple?
Where did you get the apples?
This isn't exactly what I had in mind...
"Sweetheart, don't you just love convention bake?
Oh . . .I was hoping for cherry . . .
While you rested I baked.
Strawberry and rhubarb, I hope.
You're sure He said "In a pie, it's okay?". Because I really like being naked.
This better be peach!
But when did you get the...can we even afford an oven?
Can I have blueberry instead?
No thanks. I'm Paleo.
I'm not sure apple pie was a good choice
Oy vey. You've turned into my mother.
What do you mean, "alternative apple pie"?
I guess it depends on what "apple" means...
Not sure... but I think I remember god saying something about not eating carbs
But Father said that's a gateway dessert.
Just to be sure, that's Blueberry, right?
I'm just worried those left-wing dillatante judges at the New Yorker won't find a caption worthy of their agenda
That's "mock apple," isn't it?
We did OK with the apple - now let's try the pie.
You never give up, don't you?
Original diabetes
I would feel more comfortable with a Cherry Pie.
I guess it's ok if it came from Whole Foods.
Psssssst. It's just a pie...He didn't say anything about pies...
Well, technically, I suppose you're right.
Not apple, again!
Rhubarb, right? Love it.
So, you're telling me I need to invent something with which to slice it?
Resist!
I thought the oven was broken.
I'd say He's brought temptation to a whole new level, how 'bout you?
I guess this is a safe workaround.
I don't know...does baking remove all or some of the sin?
Are you presenting me with alternative fruits?
Looks delicious but you'll have to eat it yourself. I'm on a Paleo diet.
Well I say we're cooked too.
That is tempting, but bare with me, what are the consequences?
Where in the name of God did you find a convection oven!
I asked for ribs, Eve!
Do you think that was wise?
Is that your mother's recipe?
"Alternative facts. Its in the bible. Look it up."- Kellyanne
Is that homemade?
You made that from scratch? How?
May I ask where the apples were sourced?
How did you know that apple is my favorite?
Thanks, but I'm waiting for a delivery from the pizza guy.
Now, where do we find the ice cream tree?
Why is it called Paradise Lost Pie?
O.k., but only if it is gluten free.
he says if we eat all of it, we'll become republicans for life
Apple? But we’re in the height of peach season...
I don't know, it seems kind of half baked to me.
Smells incredible. What's the surprise in the middle?
I can't imagine that adding ice cream is going to make this less sinful.
Oh great! Now He'll probably banish us to America.
It's to be eternally tormented for.
- Bannon Genesis 3 : 6 -
I...uh...think I'm falling for you!
Please tell me it's cherry, not apple.
Look, the tweet was pretty clear.
Ssssssucker.
Tell me before I take a bite, did it grow on a tree?
You remind me of my mother, which is weird because I don't have a mother.
This isn't what I had in mind when you said "biblical proportions"
It says on the sticker: education apple pie, not to be eaten within the borders of Eden
And you can cook too?!
Your grandma's recipe?
I was hoping for strawberry rhubarb.
Shouldn't I just have a V8?
Let's see...He didn't say anything about pies, and there's no lawyers yet, so I guess it's okay.
One bite of one apple was bad enough.
Wait, where did you find an apple pie tree?
This looks like the mother of all half-baked ideas
That smells amazing, babe. But remember I gave up carbs?
I can't see it, but it sure smells like apple.
Listen to me, Eve. This is important. Did you snack on the apples while you were making the pie?
If it's in pie form, it can't be evil? Right?!?
I'm supposed to trust you, and believe that you've made pie great again?
Suddenly, I'm filled with carnal lust. Oh, and you're lookin' good, too, Mama!
Are you sure He said, 'Let there be pie'?
Steve Jobs already got the patent!
I call it an Apple Piethon.
Well if it's made with organic apples, it can't be bad for me ...
Why do you persist?
You know, I'm still not getting this whole concept of'eating'.
So you used the apples from the tree but is the pie gluten free?
Not apple pie again!!
Thank GOD you used blueberries!
I've gone gluten-free.
Baked apple pie -- you've made history!
" I sure as hell hope that it's a berry pie.
My my, Miss American Pie, where's the whiskey and rye?
You say I'll know when I eat it.
I don't like peach pie.
The snake said it's not a sin if we don't have it ''a la mode''.
Holy crap, girl! The temptation to be religiously and politically incorrect here is almost irresistible.
Oh, wow, did you make that from scratch?
You're right, Eve! There were no commands about not eating pies.
Aah, life with pie
Don't you lower your eyes!
And again, so you found the apples on the ground?
Maybe just a sliver?
Hmm. Not sure that's on the Paleo diet.
I hope that's finger food. We don't have any knives or forks.
Seriously Adam... it's an organic, sugar and fat reduced pie made with non GMO fair trade apples in a union bakery. What could be wrong with that?
So, in a pie, we're okay?
Well, I guess so...your grandmother's recipe, you say?
It's tempting, but what's inside?
Do I like apple pie?
Don't tell me you were ribbed into baking that.
So you just all of a sudden knew how to make a pie?
I wish I could, but no gluten for me! Maybe just a piece of fruit instead...
if wer're gonna loose all this, I woulda gone with Jewish apple cake.
Let me read you the Scripture again
It's called pie. Apparently it's sinfully delicious.
Please tell me this isn't apple pie
Is that blueberry or apple?
Honey, if He gets a whiff of this, we're out of here!
No thanks Eve....still stuffed from the apple fritters you made for breakfast!
Did he say anything about "extreme vetting" when he gave you this recipe?
So, it's an apple derivative not an apple?
It's not the apples I'm worried about. Does God know you used his oven?
Now I wish I hadn't eaten of the Fruit of the Knowledge of Good and Bad Fats.
Sure, throw it in my face. What could go wrong?
Gees, I sure hope there's a loophole in that whole forbidden fruit thing.
God knows you are not Martha Stewart.
The first "form over substance" conundrum!
Any chance that's blueberry?
Oh gee, I'm gluten free.
I'm sorry Eve, you know I have celiac disease.
I didn't know you were an American
Don't tempt me! All I want is an apple.
What's next; motherhood?
Eve, that smells so good - are you sure it is not forbidden?
We’ve been over this with the cider, the butter, the sauce, the jelly, and the fritters, but it’s still just a distinction without a difference.
Who are the Morgans and why did they send us an apple pie?
Apple pie again? Don't we have some of that baklava left over?
So we're bypassing Paleo?
Wicked!
sorry, no, i'm paleo
No, no...apple ploy!
I'm gluten free. Can we just have fruit?
'We're being evicted, so I grabbed enough for pie."
What the hell is a locavore?
So an apple by another name really is not an apple?!
No problem. It's BAKED apple!
Aargh! There you go again, trying to take it up a notch.
Oh, Go on! Don't be such a wuss!
For God's sake, Eve, I'm gluten-free.
Somehow I doubt you've baked off all the ramifications.
Oh, my God!--how'd you know? Just like Dad's!
What about this isn't forbidden?
Yeah Eve, I don't think baking God a pie from the tree of knowledge is going to make up for what happen.
Not apple I hope
One cup of flour, a tablespoon of cinnamon, and 8 cups of thinly sliced forbidden fruit
You mean if I eat this apple pie you will never walk around nude again!
Come on. Look at what Trump is getting away with.
Does pie count, Lord?
Well, when you put it that way...
So that's what happened with all the blackbirds!
That apple pie smells so good. Just one bite can't hurt. Ice Cream?
So you're sure it doesn't contain any of those little red balls, that hang from the Tree of Knowledge?
But dearest, half-baked knowledge is not the solution to fake news
Do you think He'll like it and let us stay?
No thanks, I prefer peach pie.
Wrong.
Apple pie? Are we pregnant, too?
God didn't tell me you could bake.too!
OMG! There's one in the oven?
Eve, you didn't use any apples in this, did you?
Who's Granny Smith, and why are we naming apple pies after her?
Come on...What's in the pie, Eve? What's in the pie?
Wow that smells awesome. Let me just grab our clothes first.
Um, baking it into a pie doesn't make it any less sinful.
Way to think outside the orchard.
Give me a sec.
You say you were made from one of my ribs and a talking snake taught you how to cook? I suppose now you want me to take a taste.
Well, if it's your mom's original recipe, I guess I have to try it.
Does it still count as a bite if they're cooked?
He asks if you incuded the original cinnamon.
I hope you got those apples at the supermarket.
You're right! Nothing was said about baking, or pie!
I beginning to understand why you're not doing so well in law school.
No, I heard what you said...I just have no idea what you mean by "oven."
Pears, you say?
I thought the Forbidden Bakery was closed on Sundays!
That is tempting... but I was told there would be a gluten free option?
I've already eaten too many apples today.
You're amazing. Do you think you could make one of those with apples?
Thanks, but I'm really in the mood for a piece of fresh fruit.
So it's cherry...right?
Peach?
You want me to do what for that slice?
I'm sorry Kellyanne but those apples smell real to me so you've either been misinformed or you're lying.
No apples, right?
Who knew eternal sin could come dressed in a Martha Stewart crust?
Your not trying to trick me into eating fruit from the tree of good and evil again, are you?
When I said I wanted a piece, I didn't mean that type of pie.
Better. But is it gluten-free?
Alternate fact: original sin is replaced by apple pie.
Yikes! I think we're off-script.
This doesn't look like it grows on the tree, I take a bite.
That Food Network recipe is gonna get us thrown out of here.
Oh wow, A Forbidden Fruit Pie!
Would it kill you to stay in character just once?
I don't think apple pie gets us off the hook.
So, this 'fire' thing, it works how?
Do you swear to god that it's blueberry this time?
You asked the serpent for that?
Somehow it reminds me of mom's.
That is a sinfully good looking pie
And on the 7th day, She created pie.
Should I ask why you have that pie or what happened last night first?
Pumpkin? Blueberry? Cherry? Give me a hint.
One apple made that whole pie?
So, you're telling me He meant no iPhones or other Apple products?
Does everything have to be Americanized?
Why not. Just 300 calories.
Knowledge in a pie? Did we just get irony, too?
I forgot the ribs.
Lilith, I've actually met someone else....
I wonder if this means something.
Filming continues on the "American Pie" prequel.
Shepherd's Pie? I thought we were vegans.
I feel like I should know more about gluten first.
It really doesn't smell like chicken pot pie.
What could go wrong? You used the organic apples and the guilt free flour.
You sure that's safe?
The pie that revealed the first tart
I don't know Eve, Im trying to be good. Do you have an apple?
I'm not sure pie qualifies as an alternative fact?
You're not smiling. Do you know something I don't know?
A pizza would have been more tempting.
Did you say there's ice cream back at your place?
OK, it's organic, gluten-free, sugar-free, with a whole wheat crust made with skim milk. Why the health concern? What harm could an apple pie do?
I'm tempted. Is it gluten-free?
Are you sure it's peach?
I guess I could ask Him, but I just think that, even peeled and baked, it's still forbidden.
You forgot the carnal sauce.
Don't worry, it's blueberry.
Where'd you get the pie pan?
We finally got our piece of the pie!
Honestly, I'm more into shepherd's pie.
No thanks. Steve already made me a pie.
Fake News I never ate the apple.
Wait. Are you sure it's gluten free?
Apples? Are they organic?
Eat Of It And You Shall Surely Die Pie is kind of long for the recipe card.
Is it sin-free?
Eve, I'm not sure... Is it rhubarb?
Hope this will stick to my ribs.
Eve, you gotta stop hanging out with that snake.
Pulling out all the stops, huh?
This might fool Him
Trust me, it's 3.14159 times better than that apple.
I said I wanted ribs.
Maybe later. I'm still full from breakfast.
No thanks, I don't want to possess the knowledge that carbs are evil.
I'm gluten intolerant, but I guess eating the filling can't hurt.
Is there ice cream yet?
Can we make "American as as Apple Pie" great again?..uh , honey I dunno.
In a pie, it's irresistible!
Good morning. Have you seen my leaf?
Don't worry, pies aren't on the list.
Is it made with alternative facts? Because I'm allergic to the real thing.
A, I know you and the Big Guy have a thing about apples but they are in season.
But we just went paleo.
I'd have to say that your sweet cakes and buns are much more tempting for me.
I hope you didn't use the forbidden gluten.
Alternative fact?
'Sin there?
If I had a mom, I'm sure it would smell as good as hers.
I can't imagine how I could possibly express my appreciation.
If the lawyers say it's OK, let's eat!
Temptations from the Newer Testament?
Technically, Eve, God didn't say we couldn't eat pie.
Oh Honey, that is way too many points for our diet.
He's reallllllyyy not gonna like this I'll bet.
Oh, you’re definitely staying on the island.
Martha Stewart's past-life regression.
Looks sinfully delicious, dear, but it's not exactly Paleo-compliant.
That smells sinfully good.
Its hot and will make the garden great again
You must try this it's sacrilicious!
Just as long as it isn't apple.
C'mon man! Apple Pie again!
Gee,thanks,but I hope it's not apple.
Don't act like that snake didn't make that.
If that tastes as good as it smells I'll go to Hell in an instant!
Maybe it's okay if you cook it first?
OMG! How did you get my mother's crust recipe!?
So what IS in "definitely not apple" pie?
I feel tingly and I'm swelling up. Are tbere nuts in that?
If only life was as easy as pie.
You really think He won't notice you in them in the pie?
So, the Talking Snake said God was okay with this?
How very American of you.
Well, sure, I suppose faux apple would be okay.
Oh, no, Dear! Those apples were supposed to be saved for later.
I can only eat it if the apples are imported.
If we told Him we saw it on Baking With Julia, He might reconsider.
What's fire?
So it's ok to eat, because it 's "alternative" apple?
Some of your rib was left over. Hope you like meat pies.
Who is this "Marie Callender"?
Ya know, I think I may be too naieve for Humble Pie.
This will make it even worse.
no no, no no no! pu~lease don't say it's apple
Yeah, I like you and all but I'm not sure I'm ready for that level of commitment.
We can do one of two things, eat it and lose Eden or put some whipped cream on it, hit the snake in the face with it, and be the first to do slapstick comedy.
Local Apples?
Since you've gone to all that work
I thought we were still Paleo.
How about if the snake doesn't want it we split it.
I don't know Eve, I've never heard of the tree of knowledge of good baking?
For God's sake, I do NOT want to taste a little slice o' heaven, and you can't make me!
Hey, Eve, I'm not sure how much longer I can stay in the Garden of Eatin'.
Isn't gluten forbidden, too?
I said "a la mode."
Naked and Afraid, Episode 21: Pie Puzzlement
...and you're sure that's a mock apple pie?
Forbidden fruit is fine, I just don't eat gluten.
Does this mean we're going to be deported to America?
Is there an Android version?
Oh, my God !! You baked the apple !
What's the bad part?
As American as mom, apple pie, and original sin?
God hasn't created the rolling pin yet so I had to buy this from that snake... He told me it was organic, or was it original? I forget.
When did you learn how to bake?
As long as it doesn't have apple in it.
Did your mom make it?
Ohhhh Yeaaahhhhh. I'll ruin paradise for all mankind AND go to hell for a slice of that baby
Well, if we're really out of blueberries...
Oh geeze! Did I forget the original tin??
Wow it feels like deja vu only with pie.
It may be splitting hairs, but I guess it would be ok.
Did you pick those from the Tree-of-Double-Entendres?
Smells sinful..... please tell me its cherry.
Oh good, at least it's not apple!
Quite a divine creation
Oh, Eve. You know I'm gluten free ...
Wow. You're really serious about this knowledge thing.
I'm tempted but you made it with what?
Um, Eve? I can see your pie! Also, what's that you're holding?
Well, you are right, nothing was said about forbidden pie.
Guess what's inside!
Peach? I asked for Apple.
Meat Pie again? I wonder if we could use something else?
Does it look like my mother's? I can't even remember my mother.
This is alternative apple pie. Believe me.
FACT CHECKING THE BIBLE
I'm tempted. Is it gluten-free?
Oh, sorry I'm on the paleo diet.
There is no way a so-called Garden of Eden serves kale pie.
Is it free of whatever gluten is?
Ultimately, the only difference is the "packaging".
Is it American?
Original Cinnamon Apple, huh?
Actually, my favorite is blueberry.
The cinnamon and sugar really bring out the subtle blasphemy notes
What's a pie?
I told you to toss that apple in the garbage, not make a pie with it.
Uh - let me guess...apple pie.
Oh silly me. I thought it was just a colorful metaphor.
I told her to lay off the apples. Nevertheless, she persisted.
I call it Apple version 3.14.
it doesn't count if it's baked.
I'm tempted., but I'm allergic to apples.
I'm just not sure we should trust a snake with recipes. What's his angle here?
This seems half baked.
Rhubarb and kale?
I guess it won't hurt to at least try the apple pie. The serpent gave it two fangs up.
MacIntosh?
How knowledge of good and evil became mush.
It's tempting, but I"m gluten free.
It's apple, but I don't recall anything about not eating pie.
I think I actually prefer remaining oblivious to good and evil.
Well I'll be, God in Her wisdom.
It's an apple pie, Adam. Try it, you'll love it. It's sinfully good.
Now we've really jumped the shark.
Let's call it a frisbee.
Apple pie! How original!
wait where and how did you learn to bake?
i think you maybe overthought it a little
Looks tempting, but is it gluten-free?
Apple pie! Where did you get the apples?
But that completely goes against the Paleo Diet.
Cooked with knowledge.
Apparently, we're on the eve of destruction.
Isn't that a difference without a distinction?
I was hoping for chocolate pudding
In flagrante delicto a la mode. Tempting...
Oops. I forgot to mention I gave up pastries for Lent.
Alexa, is this going to get me in trouble?
Where'd you get the knowledge to bake?
It's not God I am worried about, it's the gluten.
Your intelligence is sure it'll make the garden great again?
Eve discovers Martha Stewart
But does God want us to know about the circumference of a circle?
Do you really think a snake is the best choice as our diet consultant?
So that's civilization!
Wow! Did you invent fire to cook that pie?
How can you bake a pie at a time like this?
Okay. But I'm gonna have to get it "to go".
Remember what happened the last time I took a bite?
This App.... I mean Pear pie *wink, wink* smells amazing.
Adam---I bet it's sinfully delicious
I heard a voice say, "One bite and you have to start wearing clothes."
Well . . . I guess it's ok if it's pecan.
Is this what they call original sin?
You may have just invented Artisanal Temptation.
You cooked them?
... and on the sixth day, God created pyrex bakeware!
Original Diet Sin
So, you're saying that I can have the pie and eat it, too?
No matter how you slice it up, it doesn't change a thing.
You say it's fake apple pie, right?
That's great, but can you sew?
Luckiest of women; this is the only apple pie forever that will not be compared, unfavorably, with mom's.
Baked apple pie? Honey, you already had me at the first bite....
Smells good but I like to work up an appetite if you know what I mean.
you're SURE you're not still sore about last night?
Forbidden fruit? Okay, but is it gluten free?
American? What in God's name is an American?
I forgot which filling I used, but I`m sure it wont change the course of history/
It it's peach, it will change everything.
I'm tempted, but is it gluten-free?
I've heard about the life of pie.
Enough with the metapors, let's just do it!
Are you sure it's a berry pie?
Local, Organic?
This is organic apple pie; he said it's ok to eat.
...but I wanted cherry!
That pie was delici....What are thoooose!?
No I don't recall any rules about a pie tree.
Gee, I really shouldn't . . .
So, I'm guessing gluten is the fall of man.
Does this mean that the "Tree of Knowledge" is basically a cook book?
First, he fell for pie.
God said we couldn't eat the apple, he said nothing about making it into a pie.
So that's where the apple went.
Isn't it a bit soon,Eve has only been gone a day
Maybe it's this pie that is arousing me, Eve.
Oh no! Apple?
So, where exactly did you get those apples?
Hmm. Naked and unaware or aware and fat?
We've got blueberries, peaches, and cherries; and you have to make apple pie!
What else can you make in your oven?
What's an apple?
He clearly said not to, but I do have a weakness for apple pie.
Do you have any Girl Scout cookies?
Chicken?
I know where you came from, and I'm not eatin' that pie thing until I know where IT came from.
That's a lotta pie for one apple!
Mmmm. sure smells like a pear pie to me.
Did He say it was okay to eat apple PIE?
Although technically, we're good.
This'll take a while to digest.
Where's the ice cream?
I said fig leaf, not fig pie!
I asked what's in it. Waddaya mean, 'Nothing'?
Well, since you put it THAT way!!
Wait, did you say your name was Eve Bannon?
Shouldn't we wait until Sunday?
A voice just told me that gluten-free crust is the least of my worries.
I'm pretty sure God didn't say anything about baked apples being sinful, right?
Apple pie? What I really want is your cherry.
First clothing and now baking?! Eve, how did you learn how to do all this?
I know that peach is your favorite, but it's not in season.
Wait, are you sure He said rhubarb?
If that's apple pie does it bend the rules?
Is it gluten-free?
'Original Sin, à la mode'
Alternative theological fact: "Don't worry, hon, the big guy's power is WAY overrated!"
Since it's your first one, I thought it would be a cherry pie.
Pretty sure store bought pies also count.
This is like that "pushing the toothpaste back in the tube" thing we were talking about.
Not to worry. Snake says "it's a peach pie."
Maybe leave this one out of the Bible...
Jesus, Eve - Where'd you get that pie?
Uhmmm - let me guess. Cherry? Plum? Peach?
Where did you hide your oven?
Nice try, but I don't think that's going to get either of us off the hook
You baked me a pie with the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge?
Yes, I'm very hungry but let the serpent have the first bite.
So much for the Paleo diet.
Welcome to the Garden of Eatin'.
Where did you learn to cook Mom's apple pie?
And with fruit from that tree? Well, what do you know?
And on the eighth day, He created euphemism
Er, I'm actually paleo. Try Steve.
Do I smell apples?
You're a regular Suzie Homemaker, and I don't really even know what that means...
I'm glad you're off the fresh fruit kick.
Wait, Why does the forbidden fruit tree seem so barren now?
Snake told me if we baked the apples first they'd be no repercussions.
You know I prefer the Dutch crumb topping.
An alternative apple is still an apple, Eve.
My tree told me 3.14159...
I'll tell Steve you stopped by.
I'll take that to go.
I left an apple here--have you seen it?
Does it always have to be Apple?
Great, now what will we call it?
Why am I less tempted by apple pie than I am by the urge to grab some pussy?
For the Garden and millions of human souls I am going need some ice cream and coffee with that.
Tempting, but is it gluten- free?
Please tell me this isn't apple pie
You couldn't have used cherries?
Good, I couldn't afford to lose another rib.
Tempting! But sorry, I'm gluten free.
Apple pie ? Apple, apple, apple...What is it about APPLE ?
I don't know, Forbidden Pie seems a little decadent. What else you got?
"Aw c'mon it's motherhood and apple pie".
Wow, tempting---is it gluten-free?
Thanks, hon, but that was ALL of the figs.
Where'd you get the knowledge to bake that?
I already said no; making a pie out of it doesn't change anything.
Smells so good. You say there are apples in there... and baking nullifies the after-effects?
Yeah I like this option better.
Well, at least we did make it past the apple.
Not *knowledge* pie...
So glad you found another use for those figs!
Behold! A wisdom pastry. Perhaps we shall call it pi.
Is it guilt free and gluten free?
I have not been briefed about the contents of this pie.
Oh...umm...about that tree...
Let's try this again....
I'ts called a forbidden fruit pie?
In for a penny, in for a pound, I guess.
Oh no! You've cooked the deal!
We'll just tell God that...we ate it all.
without ice cream?
Wait, did He say "Pie cometh before The Fall"?
Listen Adam, I have an idea but it's sort of half-baked.
If eating the apple will get us kicked out, I wonder what’s the penalty for using an oven?
He didn't say "Thou shalt not eat apple PIE!"
So this is awkward, but I already made plans with them good ole boys drinkin' whiskey and rye.
Uh, no thanks...I have a headache
You know I'm on the Paleo diet.
Now all we need is a nice Moscatel to go with this. Any ideas?
Mind if I split it with Steve?
Would it be a sin if I wanted peach instead?
You can't know if it's any good until you try it, Adam.
Well, since we don't have Moms I'm guessing this must be apple pie.
What do I think? I think you're a terrific baker and a terrible lawyer.
Nice... What kind is it?
How'd you bake it?
It’s what I fantasize my mom making.
I just can't believe it'll be as good as my Mom's.
Honey, you know I only eat raw fruits and vegetables.
Perhaps Boston cream might be safer?
The Book of Genesis, Chapter 3 according to Betty Crocker
What, no blueberry?
How could I possibly work off all those calories?
I made it myself. After you made me.
If it's not gluten free we're out of here for sure.
This must be the Original Sinful dessert
I swear, it's a cherry pie!
Eve, are you sure you used the recipe from the Ritz box?
Eve, how did you learn to bake an apple pie?
'You used fallen apples? My favorite! Let's share!
Biology class finals week at DeVos University
We're going to need a lot more comfort food.
Might as well go for broke.
I understand they're organic. I wanted to know where they're sourced.
Apples! Apples! Apples! Enough already, for heaven's sake!
I'm confused. is this for me or the serpent.
Store-bought?
Are you sure He meant only RAW apples?
I'm offering you desert before the main course
why are we eating this without clothes again?
You got the recipe from whom??
How can I resist your Devil's Food pie !
Apples shmapples. I think you have boobs.
Are you sure it is gluten free?
Excuse me, my pie is up here.
Well, as long as it's gluten free...
I just don't think my mid-neck should be called an Adam's- Apple- Pie .
What's a Bake Sale?
Everyone knows a slice of apple pie a day will keep the devil away.
That crust looks divine!
You paid how much for that at Whole Foods?
I don't think adding the word "pie" to it is going to fool him.
SERIOUSLY, you really shouldn't have!
Don't worry, it's a meat pie.
Fuji? Gala? Granny Smith?
I'm cool with the apples, but is it gluten-free?
It's plum. I promise.
Well, yeah, I was just smoking some of that weed over there and I really have the munchies now, and I guess if you already picked the apples we don't want to waste them and I guess there not really apples anymore anyway so yeah it's all good.
It's OK. The apples are cooked in the pie.
Wow, did you make that all by yourself?
You tempt me with a pie and alternate facts?
But is it vegan?
What did you do with my apples?
I thought we agreed - no more gifts.
Well, I guess maybe a small slice wouldn't hurt.
You're right. How many people can say they have had a pie in Paradise?
Oh wow! You've brought the new iPie.
Don't tell me. You cut the forbidden fruit and used the wood from the tree to bake the pie.
How American of you.
Original sin always tastes better baked.
Hey, wow. That looks great, but I should really get going...
But where'd you get the apples?
Nope. That won't work.
Sorry, but I'll only risk ticking God off for a Dutch Apple pie.
I don't know. You sure they're organic apples?
"Is the crust Vegan"?
On the eighth day we got Food Network
I think you've misreading Genesis.
I thought we agreed on the banana cream.
No, I'm sure I said cherry, Eve -- cherry pie!
I dunno. The fall from grace is bad enough...but gluten?
Don't even ask how I baked this.
Another original?
When life hands you apples, make apple pie?
I don't have a fork!
Look, I already ate the fruit. I'm full.
Sure! I mean, he didn't say anything about pies, did he?
There's something troubling me. On what day of the week did God say, 'Let there be pie'?
Am I the father?
Can I have that to go?
Let me think. God said don’t eat the forbidden fruit. He didn’t say anything about not eating pie.
What sinful creation are you making me try now?
So it's the calories that make it sinful?
Um, you say the snake taught you to make it?
"White" Lie or Alternative Fact?
Don't tempt me Eve. You know I'm on a low carb diet.
What kind of pie is it?
This doet feel right. Regardless of how you dress it up, it is still forbidden.
And we speak English, right?
Rhubarb huh?
Now that you mention it, he didn't say apple ...pie
And I forgot to invent cutlery again.
Cherry I presume?
I thought you had a headache.
The original gluten sin.
Where's the vanilla ice cream?
"Blueberry?......I really wanted apple....
American?
Since God gave us apples, we'll eat pie.
The lord never said"Do not eat an apple pie,"or did he?
You're right, he didn't mention gluten specifically.
Nice of you to cook up the extra apples, but I prefer a cigarette after.
How did you bake that?
It's Garden of "Eden", not "Eating".
He swears original sin is the cause of erectile dysfunction. But this will fix both
I don't think adding a crust will change His mind.
Smells tempting but I'd prefer an apple
I get where the apple came from, but the metal tray is still in question.
Was there no mention of ice cream?
It's so much more tempting when it's hot!
Check the ingredients label.
Umm, so which fruit did you use?
Thank goodness, I thought you wanted ribs again for dinner.
Are you sure he won't know?
I really wanted Apple stock.
This is moving too fast.
Surely He won't mind if we have it a la mode.
I'd love a bite of your apple . . . pie?
Thanks, but I'm gluten-free.
Yes, Eve, I agree that He never mentioned the word'pie'--I just hate to wash out on a technicality
I don't know. He said that if we ate those apples he would punish us with something called leisure suits.
That's a pie like no mom ever made.
So, forgetting an anniversary is now a sin?
It's fine for me but the serpent is gluten free.
sh*t that's gonna go straight to my ass.
I heard them singing "bye bye Miss American Pie"
Uh, I don't know. Is it gluten free?
How did you get the knowledge to bake?
I don't understand. What do you mean,'nothing's better than motherhood and apple pie?
Tempted? Definitely - but the fork has not been invented.
Please be peach this time.
Is that cooked in an original tin?
Are you sure it's all natural?
You realy didn't have to go through all this trouble. A plain apple will do.
Not this apple pie trick again
What do you mean, snake pie?
Smells great honey. Is it gluten free?
Sorry honey. I think I'm losing my taste for this particular fruit
I'm just not sure if 'locally grown' and 'non-GMO' is really enough to make it guilt-free...
Hold on, is that a Marie Callender's pie of knowledge?
...And, darling, the best part is no real apples have been used in the making of this pie!
Ya think it's forbidden any way we eat it?
Cherry?...Peach?...Pecan?..Rhubarb?”
I hope the franchise is worth the extra sin.
Technically, pie is NOT fruit....
Baked in a what??
Tempting, but I'm worried about gluten.
Janet, you're so creative! Eve just went out for some apples, and look what you've done already!
It smells so darn tempting, the hell with the calories!
Are you sure it's organic?
Eve, please pack your knives and go.
I forget. Is a la mode more, or less sinful?
Biblcal Alternative Fact ..Exodus
Oh, Eve, you are the apple of my pie.
You've come a long way, baby.
Where did you find a bakery?
"No thanks, I'm allergic to apples
Eve, if we turn it into apple pie you think the old man will still be mad if we eat it?
Are you sure He gave us a baked forbidden fruit exception?
It's tempting, but I"m gluten free.
"I may live to regret this but could I have it a la mode?
Oh my God, Eve! You made a pie with the forbidden fruit too?!?
So, it's either eternal damnation or pie. Could you throw in some vanilla ice cream?
And you're saying that if I take a bite of this, then I'll think of something clever to submit?
No thanks. I don't want to know that much.
it's either me or the snake...
Wow, I love cherry pie.
Honey, don't you remember, I am allergic to apple?
No, I haven't "Eden."
You mean they let into the bakery like that?!?
No ice cream?
Fine, but all we really need is one crummy apple to get us outta here!
Shouldn't the knowledge of good and evil come gluten-free?
Tempting, but I'm on a gluten-free-dairy-free diet. I'll just have an apple.
Why is it called a pie-thon?
Have we just discovered the relationship between a circle's diameter and its circumference?
So you're American?
Boston cream isn't forbidden, is it?
Honey, he told me there were no apples in this fruit pie-cross my heart and hope to die.
Did God say something about cooked?
If this is terrible we're both getting voted off.
Half baked? Well, here's to the future of human knowledge...
Don't worry, it's vegan.
A completely different apple, you say?
Adam eat the apple pie and you'll stop asking for your rib back.
Are you sure it's not apple pie?
I hope it tastes just like Mom's did.
On the 6th day god made pie, and on the 7th, he better make some damn clothes.
I don't think that's going to make it any better!
It has nothing to do with your baking skills
I hope that's not an apple pie.
How did you know? America hasn't been invented yet, and I don't even have a mom!
But you said if I showed you mine you'd show me yours.
I'm more of a mince meat guy, but a little piece of apple won't hurt.
You're sure this is gluten free?
How kind ! But aren't you veering off script ?
``Eve, honey, try to understand this. A pie doesn't make the fruit less forbidden.''
And you're absolutely SURE that smell is pumpkin?
I'm confused, do I only get a bite or can I eat the whole thing?
No, wait - that's technologically impossible.
Jesus, Mary and Trader Joe's!
Now I'm confused. Is it still fruit if it's in a pie? And is God an originalist?
Are we sure God made you out of my ribs and not a lawyer's?
What's the lesser sin: ice cream or cheddar cheese?
Eve, how many apples did you pick?
It's gluten-free, right Eve?
Really, it's peach, it just looks like apple.
Eve,you continue to amaze me!
Is that your famous 'Expulsion Pie'? Maybe I'll try it this time.
No no no Adam it's pronounced cinnamon not sinnamon.
More tempting, yes, but can I get it a la mode?
Blueberry? I thought this was supposed to be paradise?
The Story of the Garden of Eatin'
I'm pretty sure He didn't mean gluttony.
Smells like hell. How about you just give me my rib back instead.
Eve, you are a devil in the bedroom and a devil in the kitchen
Who told you that if we eat it standing up, it doesn't count?
What--apple pie again?
I've gone Paleo, but I don't think a bite will kill me.
You're sure it's gluten-free?
Apple pie again? You know I prefer blueberries.
Is motherhood next?
Blueberry pie again?
He didn't say ANYTHING about not making a pie out of the fruit...
Yeah I think a BLUEBERRY pie should be ok?
I really hope that's a mock apple pie.
Jesus Christ Eve, I only asked for a rib!
Your snake just bit me.
Humm, for some reason, a cherry pie just doesn't seem right.
Black birds again. I'd rather apples.
Gosh Eve! Only if it's gluten-free.
No thanks. I just ate a bunch of my own head lice.
Did you hear that? Someone just hissed "à la mode."
I told you to get peaches. PEACHES.
Seems half-baked to me.
So that's what you did with my apple!
But I'm gluten free.
You know I'm trying to cut out sugar.
Eve baby when I said I wanted to taste your pie that was a euphemism.
Do you have it ‘a la mode?’
This feels so very wrong, but if you throw in some Haagen Dazs vanilla, I could be persuaded.
God. I think Eve is a bad influence on me.
You know I'm on the Paleo diet.
Thanks, but I'm watchin' my carbs. Wanna just have sex instead?
Pie of Knowledge?" I must say it's tempting.
You probably could have talked me into the apple, but I don't eat gluten.
You know I only do gluten-free.
Again?
I guess it's okay if it's alternative fruit.
I'm more of a peach cobbler kind of guy.
I'm glad you can cook, I'm going to be a plumber.
What is the value of pie?" "Have some and you'll know.
Maybe we need to slow down a little.
Yum, hot apple pie; where's the ice cream.
'I'm gluten intolerant.'
God's law is one thing, but pie is another.
Knowing him, he will revoke our green cards.
Thought we could use a change...I call it "Adam's Apple Pie!"
I think we should call Adams Apple Pie
You know we aren't suppose to eat refined sugar
For now, let's just call it pie for short.
What do you mean you want to see other people?
I guess a little gluten won't hurt.
Let me guess--the recipe comes with Ten Commandments.
I'm tempted, but I can't eat gluten.
It's vegan, fat-free, gluten-free, soy-free, antibiotics-free, low carb, non GMO and 100% organic. I promise.
First the apple, then the pie, what's next, ice cream?
Is that same fruit in it?
Is that Kosher?
Thanks for the rib!
This decision is not as easy as pie
Will we feel any less shame because you baked it?
Remember that big, old, apple? Voila.
Who can turn down homemade?
Someday that will represent all that used to be good.
Smells heavenly, but I'm off gluten.
OMG! Was it tonight?
If that won't make him come down we're getting a dog.
Once again, I simply don't care for apples.
I thought we were on the Raw Food Diet?
I hope it's not rhubarb again.
And on the eighth day God created Dutch apple.
Maybe we should have peach pie.
I'm off carbs.
That better be a blue berry pie!
Peach?! I was hoping for apple.
But...gluten is forbidden!
It's cherry, right?
But how do we know it's gluten free?
Looks tempting, but I'm afraid the gluten will come back to bite me.
I baked it with your sins.
Pretty sure he said apples are okay. It's the gluten I'm worried about.
Really? It's not cherry?
And you're sure we can eat it now that it's prepared this way?
For the love of God, please tell me that crust is gluten-free.
I prefer it raw.
I don't know, Eve. I've been watching my sugar intake, and God has me on a strict Paleo diet.
Uh...Gluttony... Lust...God I HATE when this happens.
You know I'm allergic to gluten, right?
1)I should have known "The Tree of Knowledge" was a cookbook.  2) Thank goodness we were not forbidden sex just rich desserts.
Following the flop of the very first episode of 'The Bachelorette', the producers decide to switch to roses.
It doesn't smell like pumpkin.
How did you know how to do that?
Do you have anything gluten free?
I'm not sure we should be eating something from the Bakery of Knowledge.
"After all the trouble we got into by taking a bite of the apple, now you're baking an apple pie?!
Eve, that does not look like a sandwich.
Apple I presume?
Too sinful?
Is that apple or peach?
My mother always served it a la mode.
That's tempting, but I just started Paleo.
Please, not apple pie
No matter how you serve it. It's still an apple!
As Eden as apple pie
Not a la mode?
Please tell me that this is NOT! an apple pie.
Wow! You found another pie. Those cows are amazing.
Don't tell me it's your mother's recipe
Impressive, but it better be one of those guilt-free desserts.
But I just went gluten-free
Eve, that's so thoughtful, but unfortunately I'm on a paleo diet.
Well maybe if you didn't have a headache all the time...
I can't. It's just too sinful.
You say it's called a 'tarte aux pommes'?
To my knowledge pi(e) is completely irrational.
Forget the "forbidden fruit" thing. I need to know if it's gluten-free, low-carb, non-GMO, non-fat, cage-free, and all-organic.
I just don't see what's wrong with using plain old fruit.
Would it be a sin not eating that ?
Mincemeat? Really?
So if you bake them in a pie it's not an apple ban?
I don't care where the apples came from so long as you used my Mother's recipe!
Even more forbidden.
Apple or blackbird?
Wow - there's nothing more seductive than a freshly-baked apple pie.
Apple pie, don't tempt me.
Would ala mode be too taboo?
Are you sure it is a no sugar, no added knowledge recipe?
And here I thought the neighbors didn't approve of our nudist ways.
The Gluten of Eden
I'm gluten-free. Maybe just an apple?
I don't know. My Dad says I'm alergic.
I'll bet that would go great with ice cream!
I hope that is blueberry.
And you promise it's gluten free?
You and the apple pie are just fine honey - its losing my immortality that's giving me pause.
Alternate apple?
Now what have you and your friend cooked up?
Apple huh?.. very tempting but I shouldn't.
Its Apple Pie. Right?
...no, high fructose corn syrup wasn't forbidden.
Um...smells great, Eve, but are you sure it's paleo?
I'd actually prefer strawberry-rhubarb.
You didn't? My favorite?
Now eternal damnation is worth it!
Uh...it doesn't small like Peach Pie
No thanks, I'm full
With this raw, organic, no sugar, vegan, gluten-free, paleo, macrobiotic pie, I thee wed.
"It's my mothers recipe".
A gift of piety.
So sugar and carbs make it ok?
You know I'm supposed to stay away from gluten.
Smells like it was worth it!
apple, apple pie, he won't know the difference.
And the snake swears it's gluten-free?
I would, but I'm off gluten. That stuff is evil.
I would love to, but I'm gluten-free.
Garden of Eatin'
Super! Did you make the crust from scratch?
Behold, the apple pie of the tree of knowledge.
Yes, but is it gluten free?
Gosh, I'm sorry Eve, but I'm gluten intolerant.
How did you know I love four-and-twenty blackbirds?
I don't know, honey. If eating one apple will get us kicked out of The Garden of Eden, then a whole pie might give Trump a second term. I think I rather starve.
Is it gluttony free?
IT LOOKS VERY TEMPTING....BUT DOES IT CONTAIN ANY NUTS???
Whew, not another half-baked idea!
Hiss . . . what a tart!
Please don't tell me you made that with forbidden fruit.
Trust me, God didn't say anything about apple pie.
You promise it's blueberry, right?
Where did you get the recipe?
I forgot the ice cream.
But are the apples organic?
He said no gluten.
You do know I'm allergic to cinnamon right?
Yea, even in a pie I think it's still considered 'Forbidden Fruit.'
It's cherry.
Holy mackerel! Just like my mom used to bake!
That look absolutely sinful; I'm tempted to eat the whole thing.
Thanks but I already had an apple.
You didn't say, "save room for dessert"
That does not look paleo to me
Crust Almighty that smells good! What are you trying to do to me?
Um... I prefer cherry.
Honey, that better not be an apple pie.
Clever Eve; but why don't we just avoid apple to be on the safe side?
This is going a little too quickly for me.
Want some Humble Pie?
Please tell me it's not...apple pie!
I agree ... adding the cinnamon makes it smell so sinful!
The pie's the limit!
You're the apple of my pie.
My mother's recipe.
Is it my Father's recipe?
If we are getting thrown out of here for this, at least you could have thrown on some vanilla ice cream!
My Mother always made it with a lattice crust.
An apple pie?
I hope the boys don't fight over it.
It's been to hell and back, so you're safe.
Forbidden my ass!
Now we've got to work on the "mom" part.
Are you sure it is blueberry?
I guess if it is cooked, it might be OK to eat.
No worries. It's a CHERRY pie!
"Now what were God's precise words about eating the apple?
Please, just one bite.
Are you sure it's not apple pie?
On second thought, maybe we should have made cherry.
The trouble with this Tree of Knowledge business, is that just about anything around here could make me smarter.
Maybe, it's too sinfully delectable!
I was feeling more like cobbler.
I won't be fooled by the apple pie, Eve.
How bout now?
He said no apple. Does that include apple pie?"
Are you sure that eating an apple pie is not the same thing as eating an apple?
I don't get it. It's still an apple.
Oh No. I just hope its not apple.
First you eat the fruit, now you have pie?!
Little Known Fact - When Adam said "I guess you are right. He didn't say any thing about the eating a pie of the fruit of the tree of knowledge" he bound mankind for all ages to endure indecisive dinner choices between partners every weekends.
Apple!? I was hoping for blueberry.
I gave you a rib, and the only thing you can come with is a pie?
Eva, I think you've over done it!
Who showed you how to make that?
Looks good, but I'd really like an apple.
Will this make Eden great again?
Knowledge pie... is that healthy?
I was ready. No way was I going to get seduced but nobody said anything about pie
Hang on. Is there gluten in it?
It's blueberry, your favorite.
As...sss ... if that makes a difference.
Raspberry? Cherry? Blueberry? Wow, I can't place the aroma but it sure smells good. Let's eat!
That's not apple pie, is it?
This is a half baked idea.
Gosh and I never even met your mom
Hmm. Is that what He meant by 'just desserts'?
Ah, you cooked my goose!
Wait, I'm visualizing baseball, hotdogs...
To eat, or not to eat, that is the question.
I'm not sure who I'm more attracted to right now...
Wow, that smells so good I could die.
I'll take an itzy bitzy slice only if it's gluten free, made with organic fruit and it comes with imported spring water.
I'm full but I could be tempted for a slice
But, I said Blueberry
It's just if I'm being honest, we're not going to beat Satan's blueberry tart this year with the same old same old, honey!
Wow! Where'd you get the know-how to do that
Maybe we can still back out. It might not qualify as 'partake' if we don't eat it.
Actually I prefer peach cobbler.
Uh oh - where did you get the apples?
Is that Sinamen I smell?
Thanks. But who the hell is Granny Smith?
Where did you get the fruit for that?
Fantastic ! It smells just like Mom's apple pie.
It's tempting but I'm on a gluten-free diet.
Booby pie?!
Rhubarb huh?
Eve, honey, is it gluten-free?
He's always tempting us to eat gluten
I heard a woman's pie is addicting.
Uh, thanks honey, but I was really hoping for your cherry pie.
I bet it's not as good as Mom's.
Is He around?
Let's see how He does on the eighth day.
You're right. I did say pious earlier.
Is that Forbidden Fruit Pie gluten-free?
No thanks, I'll just have a bite of yours.
On second thought, I don't think I'd better.
You must be Eve's sister.
Is that pie gluten free?
The concept of a bake-off is still 6,000 years hence!
If I had a mother, Eve, I'd say it's just like my Mom used to make!
Forbidden fruit? What's wrong with apple?
You want me to use a pie when you have a headache?
My doctor says gluten is forbidden.
Doesn't smell like blueberry.
I don't sin without whipped cream.
If you are trying to impress my Mother, forget it.
OMG! Is that a Marie Callender?
Well, It's not an apple....
"Do baked apples still impart the ability to distinguish good from evil?
I thought I ordered a salad.
Well, okay... Guess your solar oven idea wasn't so pie in the sky.
Smells ssssinfully delicious
This is peach, right?
I never eat pie without a cup of coffee.
Apple? I was hoping for cherry...
Tempting, but I'm trying to cut back on gluten.
Weird, I was expecting spare ribs.
What happened to the barbequed spare-rib?
''I guess its not really an apple, if its a pie."
I can't remember someone named "Mom" making something like that.
Not an other apple pie!
Hmmmm...really? Mock apple pie with crackers?
"Mm... It smells- wait. Hold on.... Is it gluten free?
You know, Eve, the way to a man's heart is not only through his stomach.
Thank God its not an apple...
Wait, so he told you this is just an 'alternative virtue'?
Tempting. . . Is that blueberry or forbidden?
A little lower please.
Blueberry? Okay, but apple is my favorite....
Thanks, but I'm trying the Paleo diet this week.
Uh oh, I hope that's Pecan.
Let me guess. Cherry? No, apple!
"I thought we decided no more apples".
Sure, I'll have some alternative apple pie.
It's just a fruit pie. No apples. I swear!
Tempting, but you know I'm gluten intolerant.
It's not the apple, it's the gluten I worry about.
...and on the eighth day, Adam recieved a utility bill.
Whose cooking program?
If God was a woman.
But what about the carbs?
This was an easier decision when we were on that raw food diet.
A la mode or no deal.
Can you wrap that to go?
The alternative fruit is not forbidden, you say?
I expected bacon.
Great, now even our food is ashamed.
Soon after Adam was deceived and ate the forbidden fruit he changed Sara Lee's name to Eve.
I'll return the original tin.
Ohh!!!...it’s a CHERRY pie.
You had me at the apple!
You're sure this is cherry?
You tempt me so.
Oh God I hope that is PUMPKIN!
If you add some vanilla ice cream, it might be worth it.
Don't worry, this is not an apple.
Blueberry pie again.. Would it kill you to make a nice Apple pie?
That looks pretty fancy. Don't you think we should dress for dinner?
Wow Eve I didn't even know pie was invented yet.
"Well, ok, if you're sure it's gluten-free..." [NOTE: Resubmission; first entry had a typo and system would not allow correction]
Baking it in a pie won't take away the curse, but it is the way to my heart.
Do I know about calories yet?
No more apples!
What, you've never heard of humble pie?
I don't think alt apples work either
Don't tell me he owns bakeries as well as hotels.
Blueberry again. Can't we try apple?
You're sure it's gluten-free?
Do you have any other flavors?
Maybe I don't want any pie.
I only hope it is apple!
Uh, is that gluten-free?
What does "pie or die" mean, exactly?
I mean... He cant get mad if you used the rotten ones?
It may be OK. It doesn't look like an apple.
I can't see how a tiny piece can be such a major deal.
I'm no lawyer, but I think this is what is called 'compounding a felony'.
Well yeah, He didn't say anything about pastries....
I suppose He'd be okay if we ate it as pie
I have a bad feeling about this, I've never trusted that sneaky pie-thon...
The apple, OK. The pie, OK. But Eve, there aren't anymore temptations, right?
I cannot believe you made me an apple pie! I promise nothing will ever change.
Didn't God warn us against eating refined sugars?
Oh, Evie, so sinful. You know I shouldn't do gluten.
But God told us not to eat gluten.
I can see it is a decidedly modern take, but I can't help but think the consequences are going to be the same.
I don't know . . . Are you sure it's gluten free?
If I eat this I'll love motherhood? What's that?
Evil it is!
It's not the sin it's the gluten I'm worried about
#notmyamericanpie
Good thing there is no survival of the fittest.
So, technically, it's just a pie?"
Do you really believe 'alternative' apples are okay?
If we call it an "alternate apple" it's safe to eat.
Oh man, I forgot to stop and get milk!
I appreciate the offer, but I'm totally off gluten.
When life gives you apples ... PIE!
Strange. I thought the oven was broken.
So, it's really just a derivative?
I can't, I'm paleo
Maybe it's no longer forbidden?
Are you sure it's cherry?..I don't want to cause a big whoopty doo!"
Eve, are you sure that this will make us Abel to raise Cain?
You can call yourself 'Mrs.Smith' but I still think He'll know it was you.
you couldn't find blueberries?
Is it hotter than hell?
Are you sure it is gluten free?
Only if it's gluten and guilt free.
This is as close as I can get..
Wow, and I'll bet it's organic.
Really? Guilt-free low-calorie?
So you're saying it's NOT a sin if it's from the Tree of Carbs?"
Is this the beginning of motherhood?
I'm thinking we should eternally obey this snake. He did get us this great oven.
What'll you try next, a strudel?
Shoot, I forgot we were supposed to celebrate our anniversary tonight.
Working on another book deal, Eve?
I'd ask if it's as good as mom's apple pie, except we don't have one.
Granny Smith?
It has a bit of a brimstone aroma, what's that about?
Go ahead. It's gluten-free.
Peach pie? Are you kidding me?
Blueberry? Blackberry? Cherry? Cranberry? Raspberry?
No thanks, I'm on a Paleo diet.
Well, OK, if it's gluten free...
Yeah it sounds good, but the knowledge of good and evil can have a terrible after taste.
Are you sure that apple PIE doesn't count?
Seriously...there's an excssssssssseption for bake sales?
They said there would be cake.
No, no I said APPLE!
American Pie VIII: Genesis Edition, Take 2
Where in the world did you find heritage apples?
"It's my mothers recipe".
Isn't it a bit late for humble pie ?
Wow, apple pie! You should've have!
You know I'm going paleo.
Does Apple Pie count??
Yeah, again, I'm just not sure I should trust the legal advice of you Justice Department lawyers.
I'm gonna have to talk to my attorney about this one.
Are you sure you didn't use any GMO ingredients?
But I thought we were on the paleo diet?!
Pie 1000 calories. Apple 75. What am I missing here?
I hope it was worth it!
It's a trigger for me!
I don't suppose you have ice cream?
That seems half baked to me Eve.
The real sin here is that I have Type 2 diabetes.
That's cherry pie? Well, okay then."
The product placement in this movie is really annoying.
You sure he didn't just make up the "pie exception?"
Since the release of Snow White, the serpent had to find other ways to trick Adam and Eve to eat the forbidden fruit.
… and she gave also unto her husband with her; but he didst ponder as to whether it was gluten free …
What are apples? Have you ever tried one?
It could't be your Mother's recipe.
God likes apple pies? So he doesn't mind? This changes everything.
No. Mr. Bourdain will eat snake.
don't worry adam, it's chicken pot pie
The worst part of the Knowledge of Good and Evil was the shame that came with gluten consumption.
"Peach? I guess I could have peach." THE WHAT IF HISTORY OF THE WORLD
I was looking for my fig leaf. Oy, is that where it went??
I can barely get my dick in that.
How many calories are in slice of knowledge pie?
Now you've done it.
Eternal damnation in hell or pie.... eternal damnation in hell or pie...who wouldn't choose pie?
Sweetie, please don't take everything literally I say in bed.
No! No! He said, “Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the vault of the sky, not pie!”
Once bitten, twice pie.
Eat from the pie of knowledge of good and evil carbs.
It's our anniversary isn’t it?
I dunno, my doc says it's forbidden.
Apple pie again? THAT's original!
Fine. I admit it. My real hang up is the gluten.
Gee whiz Eve, we were already punished for that damn apple, what will he do to us for eating cherry pie?
Four and twenty blackbirds again?
I'm having a Deja vu.
I'm tempted but Steve has a gluten allergy.
I said naked, not baked!
Who told you these Tree-of-Knowledge fruit pies should be half-baked?
Darn, I was hoping Banana Creme.
I forgot to mention I'm on a raw diet.
Hmm, if I had a Mom would she have made it this way?
Is this Mom's apple pie?
Does that come with ice cream?
I thought I said "Go make me a sandwich."
Neither of us eat pie Eve.
So why the hesitation? It's gluten-free!
Apple pie, the 2nd best feeling in the world!!
Welcome to the neighborhood!
Don't punk me Eve. You swear that's cherry cobbler?
Well, if you put it that way.
You are not the pizza man and I'm not taking a chance.
Then God said, "Let there be gender norms."
Screw the couple's therapist! Can't we just admit I'm gay?
Compliments of the python?
Talk about original sin!! Forbidden pie without ice cream?
The forbidden fruit is OK if it is baked in a pie
I'm confused. That's not what the book said.
Jeez, rhubarb, seems off somehow.
No thanks, I'm on a cleanse.
I really don't want a bite. I'm trying to eliminate glutens.
What, peach again! Why don't you listen to this guy and try apple for a change?
That's looks like tempting piety.
Didn't He say no sugar, or no dessert, or something like that?
I'm getting a weird vibe here.
Honey, I would, but I'm gluten-free.
You don't happen to have any vanilla ice cream to go with that Apple pie?
Ooh, an apple pie! That's original.
Hmmm, is that crust paleo?
Wow...I wonder if it's baked will it still count?
Is there butter in the crust? I'm a vegan.
They're not cooking apples!
I'm not sure I want to know what a calorie is.
Good try Eve but I'm still allergic.
I guess it's OK now that the fruit's been cooked.
I feel the sudden need to put clothes on.
Gee ... Microsoft or apple?
You burned it again.
I told you CHERRY pie!
Sure. Just one slice. I think this paleo diet is probably just a fad anyway.
Honey, come try this. I baked the devil out of it.
Nothing goes better with ribs.
You're sure it's gluten-free right?
Wow- you even sprinkled it with Original Cinnamon!
I don't know. Looks too American to be sinful.
Is it recipe from my thigh?
APPLE PIE!! My favorite!
Is that really apple?
How do you like them "alternative apples."
aaaaand what is in this again?
You want me to stick my what in it??
You say it's peach pie?
He did say not to eat the fruit, does a pie count?
I hope that's mock apple
Do you have apple?
No, it looks delicious. I guess I was just hoping for à la mode.
What do you mean by "pie"?
Oh Evie! So sinful, that gluten crust but maybe just one bite. How bad could it be?
Are Amy and Steve still coming for dinner?
I thought you ate it.
Maybe I should go back to sleep and see if he'll make silverware.
Apple pie, or apple piety?
The crust makes it seem a little decadent.
Stand back, I don't know how big this thing is going to get!
Is it still "forbidden" if it's in a pie?
I'm really more of a cake person, but...
Gosh, hun, you didn't have to go to all that trouble.
Since we name stuff, let's name it Trojan horse.
So... I stick my dick in that?
Tempting . . . but is it gluten free?
Let me guess...apple, from the ...you know.
So what am I supposed to eat it with?
You go ahead; apples make me gassy.
Well it certainly seems wholesome enough.
Actually, the apple I'm good with - it's just that I'm not really eating carbs right now
Just the smell of gluten makes my head itch.
It's ungodly good.
Seems legit.
He says it's entirely locally sourced.
Please understand, I'm gay!
I hope you used the organic apples?
Please God, make it French-Apple.
I don't know - doesn't baking take some of the good and evil out of it?
"But, but ... are you sure it's peach?
I don't know, I was more in the mood for apple fritters.
Pi? What's pi?
Are you SURE this is ok in our paleo diet?
Looks fresh from the Garden of Eat-en
I'm sure it's delicious but it sure brings up some complex questions about Paleo.
Hey guys, you're getting ahead of me here.
Not the baked Four and twenty again!
Blackberry, I hope?
Where's the ice cream? Or, did you forget we're living in Paradise?
I thought we were going gluten-free.
Better call it quiche.
How did you manage to bake a pie? Everything is ferns
So you say you checked out this "pie exception" with the Big Guy?
Did He really say "Thou shall have pie?"
Eve, please tell me the apples were locally sourced.
You couldn't have made a blueberry pie?!
Don't worry, it's only pecan!
But what if I don't want to be great again?
I hope it wasn't made in a facility that may also process peanuts
Are those GMO apples?
Not dinosaur pie. Again.
I don't remember this being on the paleo diet.
are you sure this is organic
You know I like blueberry!
I could have resisted the apple, but this is just too much. Who taught you to do that?
I'm trying to stay away from gluten, but boy, that looks tempting.
Wait... lemme go grab my fig leaf.
Did you bake that all by your lonesome?
Umm, well that's really great, Honey. I guess I should hurry and invent the 'Fork' before it cools off..

And you swear the Big Guy was OK with your "forbidden fruit pie?"
Smells good, but I was hoping for Boston cream...
Did the snake say it was gluten free? I don't want any problems after we eat it.
Oh Babe, that is so tempting, but I actually stopped eating gluten last Monday.
Th fruit of Eve's labor
Are you sure we should go through that again?
This apple pie looks so beautiful as it is. It would be a shame if we ate it.
Next time could you make it a crumb crust?
You saw I was coming so you baked me a pie!
I don't recall him saying anything about giving it a good whiff.
I'm kind of filled. I'll just have an apple.
A la mode?
You mean you did all these stuff and God still doesn't know? This knowledge fruit sure puts us ahead of God!
It's an original sin... I mean recipe.
Is pie a sin?
apple pie trumps visas, bigly!
Got something different than peach?
Tempting, but I'm gluten free, remember?
It's okay if I eat it standing up, right?
It's tempting, but I only eat my apple pie a la mode.
I think you can see how excited I am about this. Did the snake get you the oven, too?
It's OK, Adam...the apples are from Russia!
I wanted the cherry not the apple
It's sin, have a little sin.
Apple pie is permitted? Are you sure?
A 'good and evil pie', He didn't say anything about not eating of that, did He?
"Four-and-twenty black...." I think you're in the wrong story.
I dunno, Eve, smells delicious, buy I still think it's going to be a deal-breaker!
That smells simply erotic!
That was for my cider.
I know apples are forbidden, but are you sure a pie is ok
Gluten and sugar free?
Oh, my God, it's the forbidden pi.
But I wanted cheesecake.
Duh! Of course it's apple.
Did the serpent put you up to this? Didn't I warn you that he is evil and has a warped sense of humor?
APPLE PIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! How did you know it is my favorite???
Yeah it has apples, but is it gluten free?
I hope this doesn't start our first fight -- apples again?
You sneaky little - ! Goddamn, you're good!
As long as it's gluten free, I guess I'll try it.
Uh.....The devil made me do it?
You say the recipe was on the Ritz cracker box?
Wait, there's a baked apple pie tree here, too?
In the beginning God created pie. And it wasn't easy.
I'd love to but I'm gluten intolerant.
I don't think he can tell what this is.
That better be banana cream
Well, yeah...I'm sorry. I just don't like the texture.
It'd be a shame to let all this fruit go to waste.
Tempting, but I'm vegan....
I dunno...Is it gluten-free?
OK, but have you read the end user license agreeement?
Turning it into a pie and calling it 'Just Deserts' doesn't make it okay to eat.
Apple pie, really? I thought Lilith was crazy.
Apple pie again!
It's my coveted forbidden fruit recipe.
I dunno...is it whole wheat?
But is it low carb?
So BAKED apples are OK?
As long as it's gluten free I think we're safe.
The serpent said I should avoid gluten.
I apologisz Honey, all this time I thought you ate it!!
You're sure this one is gluten-free?
Berried and scared.
I hope it's cherry.
I thought pi was an irrational number...
I'm not sure the framer had this in mind.
Adam, "I hope that's pecan pie."
Now he's saying, "Bake it Great Again."
Forget Sin, I'll burn the roof of my mouth!
“Okay, we’ve got the food covered for our party, but I still think we’re going to have to come up with another card game beyond strip poker”.

You say it's made from artificial ingredients?
Yeah, I know everything you make is creator approved, snake approved, and you approved, but I'll pass.
Are you sure this is peach?
So the serpent told you, if it's wrapped in pastry and cooked, then its OK to eat them?
You know I hate rhubarb.
Seriously?! You know I can resist anything but the scent of cinnamon!
No thanks. I don't like pie.
Mincemeat? Okay, why not?
That's gluten free, right?
Umm... that pie looks awfully sinful.
APPLE PIE!! My favorite!
Who told you that the regulations were silly?
Let me get this straight. You got this from a place called Village Inn and not "the tree?"
For want of cinnamon, the serpent failed.
Tempting, but is it gluten- free?
I should've mentioned this earlier, but I have a gluten allergy.
not worth leaving for Eve
Only if it is gluten free.
Eve's ORIGINAL SIN CORPROMISE
That looks good but I think I'd prefer a Macintosh and thou.

No, I haven't seen American Pie yet.
Pie, Vey!
With my cholesterol, you really are the Eve of destruction.
I was hoping for snake pie.
Sorry. I'm celiac.
You call it fruit filling, I call it apple.
As long as its Gluten Free
Are you getting complex already?
wait, woah woah woah, should we even be white?
But that's not on the Paleo diet
The apple was bad enough. I don't want to know what happens after gluten.
As long as those apples were organic
Eve, you know damn well that I can never resist your forbidden fruit pie!
We need a change.
Any chance it's mock apple pie?
I don't care about the apples, but is it gluten-free?
Guess it can't be any worse than that devil's food cake you made last week.

I swear it's not apple.
Butter crust I pray? I think it's against my religion to eat lard.
I'm not sure you should be cooking the apples.
Eve, this tasteless scheme that you and that serpent have cooked up is so half-baked!
Lemme get this straight. Are you offering me a slice of heaven?
Disguising it isn't going to make Him forget it's an apple.
Is this going to make the world any better?
It doesn't smell as good as mom's, but if you insist...
The fruits of the tree of knowledge -- they're organic, right?
The snake says he made us a 'glutton free' pie?
Welcome to an alternative reality.
Hi, I'm the Barefoot Contessa.
Well, I don't remember Him saying we couldn't put it in a pie.
Good point, Eve, the Lord didn't say anything about eating processed fruit from that tree.
I'm tempted, but is it Paleo?
If that has carbs, I believe the whole thing is forbidden.
I hope you used your father's favorite recipe.
What will the serpent say?
Who's Steve.
I love apples, but is it gluten free?
Bet we'll be known for the original apple pie!
Looks good, where did you get the idea?
Smells wicked good, but I'm trying to stay away from everything everlasting.
I don't know man. I think getting high and fucking in our neighbor's backyard is like totally hot and stuff but we should probably leave the shit in their pantry alone right? Like he's a fucking lawyer you know?
Madam I'm Adam. Eve-damned-Eden-Mad-Eve
If we eat that, we won't be in shape for birthday suit season.
Technically speaking it's not
Please eat this strudel so you can cover your noodle.
Does it still count if it's baked in a pie?
Does your snake want a piece of my pie?
We should call it 'Pi'.
If that's shoofly pie, we're still OK.
Yes, it smells delicious, but aren't you afraid you might be setting some sort of underhanded patriarchal precedent here?
Surely, I won't die if its apple pie?
The snake says I should eat this so-called apple pie.

Sorry, but I really can't if it isn't gluten free.

You're right, I really would like to know what's in that pie.
How did you know how to do that?
You made it with Ritz Crackers?
And you are sure carbs are okay?
Well, as long as its trending . . . .
Another scary original ! Now we really are cooked!
Thanks. But I am actually try to shed a few pounds. Would you happen to have any fruit around?
You're sure it's Paleo?
Technically, do you think this counts as forbidden fruit?
Organic? Gluten and sugar free? Wholegrain and fair trade?
So this is what you got when you divided circumference by diameter?

Martha Stewart Living Issue 1

It's supposed to be survival of the fittest, this is too fattening.
Hmmm...make it peach, and we have a deal.
Thanks, but where is my barbecued rib?
Ugh! Is that some organic erectile dysfunction stuff?
Cherry pie? Sure, why not?
Oh no! Mother's apple pie!
The crust certainly looks 'original'.......
One time at bible camp...
I'm tempted, but how do I eat the damn thing?
I think we are going too fast.
Gee, thanks, Honey. I'm more in the mood for cherry.
I think we should call this a double entendre
Sure I'll have some pie, but where'd that apple go you wanted me try?
Mmm.. you make the best Knowledge of Good and Evil pie!
Smells wonderful. Whose recipe did you use?
No more apples!
I don't know... are you sure the apples are "organic"?
It's really tempting, Eve, but what about the gluten?
Let's call it 'climate change'.

Has He made windowsills yet?
It's not sinful! It's different.

Wait there aren't any apples in that, right?
Here goes my Paleo diet!
How did you know pie crust is my weakness?
I tried to eat healthy since the New Year...
But it is American...
As long as it's gluten free, I say we take the risk.
Sorry, I only eat paleo.
I thought you were supposed to give me an apple...
Shouldn't we leave room for original sin?
He said forbidden fruit, not pie.
The Lord said "NO" to apples, apple turnovers, apple fritters, and apple martinis. Why do you think He'll be OK with apple pie?
Not sure which is hotter?
Oh, to hell with my diet.
I'm OK with sin but I can't handle glutens.
It's made with organically grown apples and a gluten free pie crust, try it.
Forbidden fruit pie? Think of the optics.
If you cook it, he will come.

I'm sure the sugar-coated alternative fact version will be easier to swallow...but...
Tempting, but I'm watching my carbs.
Is the crust at least gluten free?
Oh God, a sinfully delicious apple pie!
You know what the apples do to my digestive track, honey. How about some shepherd's pie instead.
smells like an "alternative apple" pie to me
Uh, you know what? After that whole apple-thing, I'm gonna grab something on the way to work.
Shall we eat first?
Wow, that's God awful!
I think it could use a few more minutes in the sun
Have you seen that wall? If we eat this pie we'll never get back in!
Don't worry, it's Rhubarb.
Oh baby, is that cinnamon? He didn't say anything about cinnamon.
Okay, let me get this straight. The serpent's name is Donald and he told you that this baked good is very American?
Wait, I remember reading about this somewhere.
Babe, is that gluten free?
Leaving Eden has never been more american.
Just like mother use to be bake?
That baked apple smell makes it so damn temping.
Good God Eve, not another serpent pie!
I don't care about the apples; is the crust gluten-free?
What's an alternative apple pie?
Hmm. Smells good but that's not in the script.
Sorry, I can't - I'm gluten intolerant.
Did you make that crust with lard? That's on my "forbidden foods" list.
Thank you, but I have to watch my carbohydrates.
OK, I guess, but I prefer something more rational.
Are you sure the sugar was organic?
Suddenly and without knowing why, Adam grunted: "Com'ere woman. Gimme' a piece!"

It's apple.
KellyEve, I don't think the big guy is going to be fooled by this "alternative fact".
I hope it is not apple.
But does pie goeth before the fall?
"Didn't I order a McRib sandwich with this?
I think it still counts as a ban.
What's 'gluten'?" What's 'free'?
Ok, ok... just please tell me it's gluten free.
Wow, all Eve gave me was a raw apple.
Are the apples free-range?
He says it's rhubarb.
Are you sure it's been vetted?
Smells delicious... but is is gluten free?
Something smells fishy...
Oh, Adam! It's a boysenberry!
Whoa! "Martha Bakes" has brought temptation to a whole new level.
Apples of Knowledge Pie sounds great, but is it gluten-free?
Eve honey, I think this is gonna cause trouble with the proof text people.
My pie couldn't be fresher!

No thanks,it's still an apple.
What is the fruit of the day?
You're stealing from windowsills now too?
I should have let you know - HE told me to cut back on carbs!

Just try it, Betty from up the street makes them.
I think this is a half-baked idea that won't end well.
Eve...apples? Now we'll have to move again.
Did you remember to bring the ice cream?
It's apple.

This isn't apple is it?
Do you think cooking the apples absolves the sin?
How many God Watcher's points is that?
Wait, what did I just eat?
Is that original sin crust?
'Could I get a piece without the fig leaf?'
I mean is it still forbidden if it's in a pie form?
Wow, was it that good for you, too?
oh...not gefilte fish again....
Well ... as long as you're sure it's gluten-free.
I guess if it is genetically modified, it's not forbidden.
Eve, you are so clever - cooking it as a pie does not make it forbidden, right?
Why am i not surprised this is how Martha uses her time machine?
Got something less fattening?
After the pie maybe we could have some dessert.
It is alternative blueberry pie.
I put it where?
No, babe, that's not my idea of having it real hot for a change!
Nice try, but I doubt He will be fooled.
Honey! Your mom sent us this! It might be Apple, though...
" I knew I should have waited, you didn't tell me you were making pie".
So, you're telling me this isn't apple?
Tell me it's gluten free.
Don't worry, the ingredients are local.
So if I don't eat this, the terrorists win?
We don't have any clothes, but yeah, I got a haircut.
Not a quiche - a kiss!
So, this is going to help me to 'Think Different'?
No. I meant Humble Pie.
I didn't want you to go to all that trouble for me!
I'll help myself if you don't mind.
I thought we agreed, no cheat days
Uh, I thought this was the Garden of Vegan
When we get kicked out of here, I'll need to invent a pot holder.
Go ahead, taste it. My recipe is of Biblical proportions.
I hope it's rhubarb.
Oh, you baked a pie so automatically I am the one who has to find outside employment...
I believe He actually said: "Don't eat that apple or you will be baked!"
Just to be sure...the box did say "guilt free", right?
Do I have to guess the number of blackbirds before we can eat it?

I'm thinking that organic apple pie is still a no-no.
I don't even know where to begin.
But we were told not to touch the apples.
hmm...is that by any chance cherry?
I heard you just moved in so I made you something
But...gluten is forbidden!
I thought you were a raw foodie.
Alternative fact #1 Apple pies are always made with peaches.
I sure hope that crust is gluten free.
OK, so the filling may be forbidden; but is it organically grown?

Baked goods and evil?
What did you two cook up?
I like my fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil pie ala mode.
Apple? I prefer lemon meringue.
Really? It's gluten free?
I feel like I am being led into temptation on speed dial.

How did you do the crust?
Dessert's done? I guess I should start on the ribs.
Wow, that looks just like Mother's!
Is it an apple tart?
You don't understand a la mode?
I'll take it, if you promise Eugene Levy isn't here.
Maybe we should cover ourselves - those apples are hot !
Tempting, yes, but does it contain gluten?
What do you mean, you don't yet know what kind of pie this is…?
You're right, maybe He won't guess it; all I can smell is the cinnamon.
Tree of alternative knowledge? Pinky swear?
My God, Eve, a fresh baked apple pie - there's no way that would be Forbidden
If it's cooked is it unforbidden?
Are we in America?
Eve, the one rule here is as easy as pie. It's just a saying. It's not to be taken literally.
This could become the fall of my waistline.
Smells sinful! Unfortunately, I don't do gluten.
Do I 'know' you?
And gluten-free?
Is it gluten free? I shouldn't have it if it has gluten in it. Also no nuts correct? How about dairy? How about high fructoce corn syrup? MSG? No saccharine?
That looks just like grandma's
You're sure that since we're in paradise, apple pie is not fattening?
Wait, what do you mean you didn't use organic sugar?
Is that what my Mother taught you?
Okay, I'll do it. Let's just hope no one makes a movie about this.
Adam, would you like a slice of my Alternative Facts pie?
I used to think all those people who called you an evil tart were wrong but now I’m not so sure.
It's not made of forbidden fruit, is it?
Thanks no, I've gone gluten free.
I don't think that I like them apples.
How do I know these aren't fake apples?
It looks divine.
No thanks. I'm gluten-free.
I thought you were going to make a banana cream pie.
Did you use father's recipe?
It appears you take great pride in that pie, but now we'll have to start a clothes budget.
Where did you get the ingredients?
Pie, huh. Now that's an entirely different kind of thing.
But you know I'm pre diabetic.
Is it nut and gluten free?
I'm tempted but I'm trying to stay gluten and guilt free to eat gluten free
That looks sinful, but why do I need to wear a fig leaf?
I, uh, just started the Paleo diet, so I’ll have to pass.
Is that paleo friendly?
It was meant to happen so just relax and let's have dessert.
He told you that the apples were organically grown?
Why did you cover the pie's nakedness?
Gee I don't know. Is that gluten free?
Is it to go?
Now that's really hot!

I won the church bake off!
My God, Eve, a fresh baked Fruit Pie - no way would that be Forbidden !
They were warned; they persisted. #so-calledGardenofEden. LIES.
Is it possible a la mode ?
You know blueberry would have caused fewer,future problems.
Oh, I'm just not that hungry right now.
Is it apple or cherry?
Whoa! Don't let our personal trainer see that.
Adam, If I knew you were coming, I'd have baked a cake!
Never heard of 'knowledge' apples.
I'm not that hungry right now. Do you have any fruit?
No thank you. I'm gluten free.
So what if I didn't vote.

Apple, schmapple, I don't want the calories.
Yes, I do need a fork.
Since you're tired of cherry pie why don't you try this?
You're right. Making a pie was much more pleasurable than eating a lousy apple.
What's that?
Gosh .... where did you learn how to create?
But I asked for chocolate meringue!
Are you trying to tempt me? Remember, I am eating Paleo.
Oh geez, Eve ... you know I'm allergic to gluten!
Wait, whats in there, and how did you figure out pie?
I hate this paleo diet.
Apple or cherry?
It's not my fault! I wasn't fully briefed!
the 21st century called and said we're doomed, let's eat.
What, no coffee?
Is that on the Paleo diet?
Is it rhubarb?
Well, we might as well keep exploring new recipes!
Honeycrisp or Granny Smith?
But it is gluten-free?
Does this pie adhere to locavore standards?
Just as long as it isn't forbidden fruit pie.
Not sure. Peach you say?
I don't know Adam, this smells good as Hell.
Who’s Lilith? And why does this smell like arsenic?
Promise this one doesn't have raisins.
Sorry, I'm on this futuristic 'paleo' diet

Is it free?
I didn't mention I was gluten-free?
Are you sure it's glutten-free?
Is this pie okay with the guy in the sky?
I only eat fresh fruit

It's still forbidden, but at least it's sweet.
No, I don't think he'll make an exception because you won "Pie Wars."
Fangs but no fangs.
You mean we're not going to live fat free.
Hey, it's like the serpent said, "A woman's place is in the kitchen!"
Wow! That's so American of you!
Ah, I love your pie hun, but I'm not about to piss off God that was his last good apple.
It's that time of month again?
American Pie Presents: Back to The Garden of Eden
Did this come from the Bakery of Forbidden Knowledge?
Gluten-free? Guilt-free?
Is an apple pie still considered an apple?
You should have invited my parents.
I'm gluten-free now.
What do you mean you re-negotiated the sanctions? I don't know about that. I haven't seen it. What report is that? I haven't seen that. I'll have to look into that.
Let's start again...
I think he'll still find the apple.
I hope it's made with steevia, I can't take the guilt.
You know I have a gluten intolerance.
It's an alternative fact apple pie?
I'm trying to keep trim, but what harm could one bite do?
With a sheepish "delicious!" for the sour pie of eating, Adam spoketh our first lie of Eden
I hope it's apple. I'm tired of pumpkin.
a La Mode would be more tempting.
It's not what I meant by pie
I was told by my dietitian not to eat this apple pie or there will be great consequences, but it's so tempting.
How could I forget? March 14th!
He was saying something about eternal fire and it gave me an idea.
I just wanted a bite of the apple, but you baked me a whole pie.
The snake says the Boysenberry is sinfully good.
Hmmm... is it gluten free?
Adam's déjà vu moment
I can't eat that. Gluten is evil.
Where'd that come from?
Do you know what you're doing?
But He said no carbs.
It's in a pie; so I guess it's ok.
I hope you checked for wormholes.
He didn't say anything about fruit from the pie of good and evil.
You mean to tell me this whole time I could have been eating cooked meat.
I sure hope that's a peach pie!
The apples smell delicious, but I wonder if God wants us to discover pastry.
Want some pie sexy
Which kitchen?
Okay--you left out the apple, but you used high carbs and saturated fats.
Is that gluten-free, babe?
I made it from scratch
What crust.
Do you think He'll let us stay?
Pie seems out of character
Actually, I'm more of a peach guy.
Is this a piece offering?
I see you've been watching the cooking channel again, Eve.
Don't worry. These apples are locally sourced.
OK. But what about the gluten?
No, I was wrong. You can bake a pie
You sure there's no gluten in that?
I don't know if I should... Are you sure it's gluten free?
I might need a judicial determination as to whether this would constitute Original Sin.
You're still in a sense eating the apple, Eve.
It's really tempting Honey, but you know I can't eat gluten.
You think we are so innocent?
I don't know if I should.
And I thought you atethe apple
Whole wheat? It still looks sinful.
I guess it's worth a try.
Please tell me that's Four and Twenty Blackbird Pie.
But it's forbidden gluten.
It's made with unfiltered cold press extra-virgin snake oil.
Don't worry. This one is Blackberry and Rhubarb, darling.
Blueberry. Always blueberry. Why can't we have apple just once?
Isn't the whole point that sin is only bad in its raw form?
Sorry, my God forbids gluten.
Brad and I thank you. Give Rachel my regards.
The universe's first roofie.
I suppose we could pretend that its blueberry.
Hmmm. Is it low carb, gluten-free?
I've never seen American Pie.
It's not Paleo friendly.
It's ok. It's American-made.
Somehow this captures my heart...
Yes, I promise I won't do that thing I did to the last one.
You're sure he said these apples are pious?
Eve, no matter how you hide it, an apple is an apple..and we're doomed.
I thought I told you I'm doing paleo now.
So breakfast ends at ten thirty?
Just the filling please. You know pie crusts give me heartburn.
I'm going back to fig leaves. They're safer.
Are you sure it's strawberry rhubarb?
It's as American as getting kicked out of the garden
I'll pass if it's apple pie.
Well, there's no hair on it. It's probably O.K.
Didn't we go gluten free?
Wow! That smell… That flaky crust… You said you just used one apple, right ?
I don't know, Eve -- I'm thinking vanilla ice cream would make it perfect!
It looks delicious dear, but you know that I'm trying to eat Paleo.
How do you know it's not fake gluten free? 'Cause everything that snake says is fake. Fakest. Ever.
Is it gluten free,Eve?
Original cinnamon?
Oh, please God - I hope it's not apple pie!
Golden Delicious or Granny Smith?
This is the moment that Tarzan fell in love with Jane
Maybe just a sliver?
It's really an eye-opening experience?
I'd love to try some, but you know we'll have to wait another three millennia before we're able to bake it.
I guess if you're going to steal His fruit, you might as well go for the gold.
Are you sure this is this organic, gluten free and guilt free?
Warning: Filling may be hot!
He said no gluten.
And you wonder why you never passed the bar exam.
Paradise? My ass! We don't even have Ben & Jerry's to go with that.
Your husband wasn't tempted?
Tonight apple pie. Tomorrow, figgy pudding.
They were out of apples.
Smells great, Eve. God told us we can't eat from the fruit of the apple, but he didn't say anything about variations of it.
Got anything a little less filling?
If I eat this, will I have to do the dishes and clean the stove for the rest of eternity?
Now you've really cooked my goose!
Ok if the snake says it's 100% organic!
Oh, sorry, he bit me. Can I have the pie?
Well, He did say not to eat the apple. He didn't say anything about pie.
Glutenfree, right?
What exactly do mean by "from scratch"?
What was that about "crusts," "ovens," and "consequences"?
Adam—please explain this hole.
Eh, this garden's overrated anyway.
That sin better be gluten free!
I told you: NO hot stuff until we, at least, get some clothes!
Where did you get that from? The 20th Century?
But I never asked you to negotiate sanctions, agreed?
I have this strange feeling of apprehension.
Damn, woman, the nuclear option on Day 26!?
It depends - do you know how to use an epi pen?
Well, if you also threw in some whipped cream and coffee...
Thanks Eve... But I think your evolving much faster than I am...
On the 8th day God created pie. It was then that Adam and Eve needed clothes!
You ruined my fruit!

Why can't you understand that a ban on eating apples is not a ban on eating apple pie?
Well - if you say its Asian Pear pie - then that's okay.
Tempting.... is it gluten free?
Oh wow, so that was a baking apple?
That doesn't look very paleo.
What's Dutch Apple?
That doesn't smell like blueberry ...
Well, if this still gets us banned, at least now we can expect a protest
Sorry, I can't Eve. I have a gluten allergy
Did the snake make you eat the apple, or bake the pie?
I'll just work it off tomorrow.
So that's how you want it! I fetch, you cook.
It really is tempting, but I'm trying to watch my carbs.
Gee I kinda had my heart set on Key Lime Pie.
Let's call it "Naked Pies Cafe"!
Don't worry, baking kills all the knowledge germs.
I thought God told us not to pick from that tree.
Oh no! Not the apple pie guilt trip again!!!
Should I go high or should I go low?
What is an apple pie?
Uh, I don't know? The last time you suggested something, I voted for Trump.
I thought carbs were forbidden?
Sure, Eve, He didn't say anything about pie!
We're going to need two scoops of ice cream, plus something to cover the pie.
It'll make the place smell more homey
Are you sure it's rhubarb pie?
You say it's faux Biden fruit pie?
You just had to do some creating of your own!
You know if we don't eat it we still may be safe.
I apprciate your generosity, but Forbiden Fruit Pie sticks in my throat.
You forgot the fork again!
Hmm, He's cool if we eat mincemeat?
I'd really prefer cherry pie. I don't see why you think apple is so special.
Where's the Cool Whip?
"Oh my god! You anticipated my desire".
...your ahh tart?
On second thought let's leave the pie here and take off for the weekend.
Let me get this straight, he said "No pie-eating people can be permanently vanquished?"
You found it on a window sill? What’s a window sill?
If it smells too good to be true, then it probably is...
You think this might be better than...
It's a Russian recipe from the Trump Delights Cookbook.
So, you didn't eat the apple?
Is it low-fat and original sin-free?
Wouldn't a cherry pie be better?
HAPPY PIE DAY
The doctor did say I needed more fruits and vegetables in my diet.
We're not supposed to eat blackbirds.
How could have done that? I haven't invented the oven yet.
Whar did I do to deserve this?
Sorry, I'm still on my juice cleanse.
I appreciate the gesture, but I'm gluten intolerant.
Eve's apple pie was sinfully good.
God warned us about refined flower, refined sugar, lard, and even processed fruit.
I have this strange urge to hit that with a stick!
I still don't get why they call it the Tree of Wisdom.
What do we use for napkins?
But I already know that
Multitasking already?
It's OK because it's made of alternate apples?
Hang on, I just need to calculate my daily Weight Watcher's point allowance.
Tempting, but apple pie without a scoop of ice cream just isn't worth the extra calories.

I don't know, where is the whip cream?
Is it made out of those whatchamacallits?
Do you have gluten free?

Why do you always take everything further than necessary?

How could I know if it's good?
Technically it's not 'eating.'
Please let me guess again. It's a pecan pie!

Apple? Is it fall already?
What if he's omsniffinent?

So young and already American?
Looks great, but I don't know what to do with it.
Apple pie! That's really tempting. Is it gluten free?
For my birthday? Oh, you shouldn't have.
I'm on a fructose-free diet, but that pie smells divine!
Maybe the sugar and spices will make the alternative facts more palatable.
Um, did you ever see "American Pie?"
My rib feels fine, but have you seen my Adam's Apple ?
Sorry, I am raw vegan
Well, I gave up complex carbohydrates fot New Year's "Eve"...
He said next time he'd bring us a really good Pinot.
Very tempting, Eve, but the one rule here is to avoid gluten.
I think He prefers cake.
I should have told you before, I'm gluten intolerant.
I thought we had that last night...
So, you're telling me that food is another thing to describe as "hot"?
Uh Oh hide it; The Creator just prohibited the further receipt of apples received from serpents without the proper vetting!
Oh no, global warming is truly happening !
And there's no fruit in there, right?
I read some pretty bad Yelp reviews about that tree's fruit. Supposed to have a bitter aftertaste.
A blueberry pie? I have no knowledge about that.
Dose your offering count as an apple?
Stop worrying, honey. As far as He can tell, there are blueberries inside.

My crust runneth over.
Yesterday I asked for a lemon and you got me lemonade.
it's a so called pear pie
Maybe we should get the opinion of our lawyer.
I feel a headache coming on.
I think He might have forgiven a bite, but the cider and the strudel and the caramel dipping and now a pie? We may be pushing things too far.
That's tempting, but what about my diet?
Kissing doesn't last. Cooking does.
Strawberry rhubarb?
But I thought pi are square?
Guess which flavor is it
Please tell me there's gluten in this one.
We sssssscream for ice cream.
That should help; too bad I can't just take a pill.
Sweeney Todd's fever dream.
Where did you ever get the idea for apple pie?
Please shave next time.
Oof, dessert? I'm pretty sure the calories in that thing are totally sinful.
Snakes can't talk. We'll eat the pie first, but then we're taking you straight to see the Doctor.
Sure, one piece is harmless
I forbid you to eat this!
One bad apple spoils the pie!
Eve, I was born yesterday but not at night.
I have an idea for a movie
So this is your pie r squared. Is this sinfully good or are you into the new math?
Sorry, I'm off gluten.
I'm willing to break the rules, but only if it's gluten-free.
I don't know Eve, I told the agent "dude ranch" not "bible camp".
I don't care if it WAS a Granny Smith!
Baking them in a pie isn’t likely to make childbearing any less painful.
Did I tell you of my celiac condition?
This must be a trick.

Apple sauce for breakfast, apple strudel for lunch, now apple pie for dinner.
Hey Steve, Can we share it with the dinosaurs?
So you think that the change in appearance should be the determining factor?
Couldn't you make anything other than APPLE pie?
I hope this pot pie is less potent than those brownies you baked the other day.
Doesn't smell like blueberry, but there's only one way to be sure; you first, Sweetie.
And you're sure it's gluten-free?
Forbidden pie, huh? Okay, I'll bite.
Something tells me we're gonna have the guilts for eating the whole pie.
I baked this especially for all future generations.
Are you sure the ingredients are ethically sourced?
But... I just took a Viagra!
That apple pie looks sinfully delicious.
Tempting, but any cheddar?
Please tell me that's gluten free.
Somehow, the is all Donald Trump's fault.
Uhhh, Cherry? Blueberry? Pumpkin?
What would happen if I passed?
An epic apple pie?
Oh no, I just gave up desserts
I would much prefer blueberry.
Mom's secret recipe!
He says it's his mother's recipe.
Shortly after eating, Adam realized there was no right answer all along.
It smells great, but I'm really trying to stick to this paleo-diet.

Easy As Pie
I'm not sure what that is but my stomach really wants me to eat it!
nan
Someone in the comments section recommended adding what?
It's tempting, but I'm glutin intolerant.
You used green apples ? I think we can get away with it.
No, darling. It's supposed to be an apple, not an apple pie. I think you should give it to the snake.
Now how do we prove we didn't taste it first?
Looks half baked.
But God said not to eat from the gluten tree!
Thanks, honey. But why do you call it Trojan pie?
I probably should have mentioned I'm gluten free.
It's OK, it comes from the oven of knowledge
Thank you Eve , I can enjoy this apple pie with out taking a bite .
How come your hands aren't burning?
No vanilla ice cream?
Gee, not quite the cherry pie I had in mind.
Oh, I’ve already been to whole foods
Pumpkin? Right?
Is that a gift from the transition team?
I have just a sliver.
Now you're talking!
The c,ard said "Welcome to the neighborhood." It was signed, Sarah Lee Serpent.
The scent alone is making me want to put on come clothes.
Think of it as alternative fruit.
Guys, it's time for some game theory
Do you want ala mode?
Tempting, but I thought I ordered strawberry-rhubarb.
Ooooh, thanks, how sweet. Looks positively sinful... can't though, I'm gluten free.
Isn't that taking it a little too far?
Are you sure this pie for us is pious?
Gee Eve I think this is called overshooting it a bit
The snake needs it to be gluten free.
Pie. You want me to guess what kind. Gee . . . !
Oh gosh, you should have. No, really — you shouldn't have.
To eat the pie or not to eat the pie? 'Tis man's oldest question.
This way, no one will know we are taking a bite of the apple.
Just what I was never thinking of.
it sure smells like apple pie
Oh, yum! Can I eat just enough to need a loincloth?
Of course I’m a patriot. I’m just trying to lose a few pounds.
Apple Pie? Don't you remember what apples does to us?

Original, but not very tempting.
Psst! Ask her if she could serve it a la mode.
Just for me? Wow! What's forbidden fruit?
Thanks, but blueberry stains – can you bake me an apple pie?
'If it's got an apple in it, we're in big trouble.'
In retrospect, we probably should have ordered out.
But you think I'm supposed to stick it *where*?
I don't know, apple pie is too cliché.
No, thank you.
Did you use organic apples?
The forbidden fruit pie doesn't fall far from the tree.
And its gluten free. How did you know?
Hidden falls
Apples and blueberries, you say?
Apple? Oh, I was hoping for rhubarb!
I prefer coconut cream.
Is that the whiff of a half-baked idea?
If we tell Him it's a cherry pie do you still think He will make us wear pants if we eat it?
I guess a bite of apple pie wouldn't hurt.
I'm in more of an avocado toast mood.
No thanks. I'm on a diet.
The gluten is what makes it feel sinful.
Unfortunately, my diet forbids that.
Gee KellyAnne, are you sure it's okay like that?
Oh, go ahead and enjoy it. It's in the Bible.
No windowsill to let it cool.
Well, if it"s all artificial...
So you're saying this wouldn't be un-American?
Only if I can have it a la mode. Can you believe I speak French?

And this movie, you say is called American Pie?
Sorry Eve. I've gone sugar, fat and gluten-free...

Oy, it couldn't be cherry or blueberry?
I asked for a sandwich.
Of course he'll like it, why wouldn't he?
Smells delicious, but I heard the after-taste stays with you.
I love a bake sale !
It's tempting, but I'm on a diet.
Pot pie? Again?!
I got this recipe from the cookbook "101 Ways to Eat Forbidden Fruit".
I guess now that it's cooked it shouldn't disagree with me.
SNAKE said it was sinfully delicious and gluten-free!

How did you peel the apples? How did you bake it? Is this some kind of anachronistic joke?
This "Mom" guy is getting our asses kicked outta here.
This is my cheat eternity.
Snake says just do the apple. The pi will never end
I dunno...I still think calling it "apple pie" instead of "Forbidden Tree-fruit pie" isn't going to get us off on a technicality.
Forbidden pie !!!!!
It’s tempting, Eve. But I’m already maxed out on my weight watcher points.
Smells like apple to me.

That better be gluten-free.
How good is it?
I don't know, I think Eve will be pissed is she smells that pie on my breath when I get home.
OK. Zero transfat, but is it paleo?
Is that your apple pie?
Original Sin and Forbidden Fruit are both great names for a pie, I just don't think that's the big issue here.
Pie my asp! You can't snake charm your way out of this.
Didn't we try that last week?? All I got was diarrhea - not any smarter at all!

You're suggesting I'm not patriotic? I don't even know what that means.
Diet schmiet, what's one more slice in the grand scheme of things?
HAPPY PIE DAY
And so the serpent realized it was too late, Eve had already sold her soul for a baking oven.
Tempting...but you know I'm gluten-free, right?
I think you missed the rule about baking on Sundays.
Is it apple? Please tell me it's apple.
It doesn't count if it's in pastry.

It doesn't smell like chicken pot pie.
Since it's just the two of us, I guess we're going to need a to go bag.
Eve, which version of Apple pie is this?
So it's a trade?
If that's not Vegan then one of us is gonna have Hell to pay!
Something different?
The Fruit of knowledge won't increase your ability to do math in p form...

Have a bite. It won't spoil your appetite.
Trying one of my Mother's recipes was just a suggestion.
Don't worry, it is not apple pie.
I really don't know what to say.

But God said, "No carbohydrates"!
Instead of sex, yeah I'll try a piece
"It's an apple pie, Eve! Like, just -- apples! As in... you know -- what you ate to get us kicked out of Eden? Geez, God clearly didn't make you out of one of my funny bones, did he? Have a sense of humor, why don't ya!?" #FirstCreationProblems
The actual 'original sin.'
Looks tempting but I'm gluten free.
Apple Pie - Go ahead taste it

Pie is the new forbidden fruit.
Wow babe, you're something-- Knowledge and Splenda!
I thought you knew that I'm gluten-free.
You got it wrong. That's not the way to my heart.
Pot Pie is not a good idea, we should just smoke the weed in our garden .
There is no shame or sin in your pie game.
But a plain apple would've been gluten free.
Hopefully it's not just another strawberry rhubarb!
I'm sorry but I don't like cinnamon. How about a plain apple next time.
Clever dodge on the apples but I'm gluten free.
Honey, you know I'm gluten free...
Forbidden fruit aside, does it contain gluten?
Just a guess, but I'd say its circumference is right around 3.14.
When you're given lemons you make lemonade and when you're given apples...you make apple pie!!
That is the most precious thing I've ever seen!
Thanks, but it's too hot to wear.
It's mock apple pie.
umm, is this vegan AND gluten free? You know how gluten makes me bloat.
It smells delicious but I don't think I can eat that all by myself.
I hope that's boisenberry!
Were you Abel to add any sugar Cain?
Did you eat one to get the recipe?
The presentation is indeed tempting, Eve, but is it gluten-free?
OK, now can I have a little ice cream on it?
Uh, reminds me of my first wife.
Just like mom's.
Does that pie fit my new Paleo diet?
While I agree there's always room for dessert, is it really worth the shame at our nakedness?
Are there nuts in that?
Does the president really believe we'd fall for that?
That apple pie sure looks hot, Eve!
Does this set a bad precedent?
The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington?
Sorry, baby -- I'm cutting out carbs.
No! No! No!..I said apple pie, not blueberry pie!
My little serpent friend here says you can have the leftover apple.
I bought it down the street at Adams Apple Bakery and Pie Shop.
Let me apologize in advance.
Sorry, babe. I'm doing this Paleo diet.
Gluten-free or not, I still think it's wrong.
Yes, Adam, artisan...A-R-I-T-I-S-A-N
Eve... where did you get the apples for that pie?
Is it a Antony Bourdain moveable feast ?
I appreciate that you made it gluten-free, but I a rather stick with Paleo.
I just feel like it's a sin to make it with anything other than a Granny Smith.
Whoa, I gotta stop doing VR porn when I'm hungry.
Honey, how did you get the fire going without me?
How can this be?
I hope that isn't one of Lilith's old recipes.
Are you sure it's allowed on our paleo diet?
You want me to stick my what, into where?!?
Apple turnover ? No, thanks...apples do not agree with me.
Apple spy.
pssssssss a little gluten just this once won't kill you.
Is that gluten free?
Those apples smell great, but is the shell gluten free?
But, we just got approved by the co-op board.
Look on the bright side, we're both into fashion.

It's like - we do love you, Lord. And we FEAR you. But - we really wanna to eat you.
...What a riboff.
The tree of the knowledge of good and evil pie DOES have a certain ring to it.
And it's gluten free?
I was hoping for one like mom used to make.
You have found a way to my heart.
Where did you learn to do that with apples?
Actually... I'm off carbs. But thanks!
I thought pie was in the sky.
Whoa, I think I better eat one of them apples too!
Apple pie, really?
Sorry Eve, Marie Callender was just here.
Are you sure? The label said "made with real fruit"...
It smells real good, but did you use organic apples and full grain flower?
He didn't say anything about byproducts.
Is it too late to eat out?
If it is strawberry, thank you. If it is apple, give it to the asp.
the forbidden pie
Is there gluten in it? You know I shouldn't eat gluten...
Oh right, whipped cream and clothes.
A pastry exception? If only He hadn't repealed those regulations.
I'm not sure gluten-free is going to cut it.
Is it still forbidden if it's been at 350 for an hour?
Yet another version of the same temptation?
It looks and smells so good, wherever did you get the recipe!
They were all out of forbidden fruitcake.
I said I wanted lemon meringue, and you bought apple. Typical.
The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil pie...now that's a mouthful
Could we say the filling not from THAT tree?
Let's eat it seriously and not literally.
I like the part about acquiring wisdom. But I'm not sure about taking you shopping for clothes for the rest of our lives.
I suppose that's one way to get around to eating an apple
Well, we don't have a grandma, so this will have to do.
Wow it sure smells like apple pie, but it didn't brown at all.
You wouldn't be tricking me would ya?
Take and eat...
I like a homeless man with style.
Hey, I signed up to lie for one apple. Now what?a
I get the whole "American as apple pie" thing, but I'm pretty sure alternate facts don't apply here.
With all that gluten, now it's really forbidden.
How sweet of you, but I don't do gluten.
Too complicated.
Is that snake turd pie??
I'm not so sure. God said I was already 'great.'
Don't tempt me into sabotaging my resolution.
Trying to tempt me with a forbidden fruit PIE this time? Now t hat's a lot of crust!
God warned me about gluten.
I don't want it to come between us.
What knowledge you have gained. Apple pie and microwave. What more does mankind need?
But 'pre-heat' sounded so wrong, honey.
Hey Sugar, your overture to our Sin-phoney?
Who can say whether fruit pie is fruit or not?
The first advertiser.
Sure, apple pie is tempting. But where can you go to get a good cigar around here?
So no longer a fruit, technically speaking, let alone forbidden fruit?
Is that the apple pie of wisdom? I know someone out in DC who could really use some of that about now.
I'm sorry honey, but that's not on the Paleo diet. Did my mother give you that recipe?
Trust me, it's organic and non-gmo.
I say beware of pythons bearing pies.
Are you sure it's He won't punish us on our cheat day? I still think it's a half baked idea...
I totally would but I'm off gluten
Trump built the wall. There is no fresh produce.
You sure know how to please a fella!
Oh, you were talking about this cherry pie.
Hope that is apple pie
You have no idea how long it took to cook with no oven.
That God created convection ovens before he created television kind of tempts me to do something I might regret.
Honey, are you sure that's gluten-free?
Cherry pie? My favorite.
That better be a blue berry pie!
What, no fork?
Not that forbidden fruit.
Apple pie I presume?
Please tell me that's gluten free.
Geez, I don't know...I'm trying to count my apostasies this week
That's great. Maybe we can stay 'cause you made a pie.
Despite our enduring and profound intimacy, I never suspected you had a solar oven.
Wait. Are you sure it's gluten free?
Pi o us....Now?
Mmm... apple. My favourite.
Well, if you're absolutely certain it's gluten-free . . .
I think He'll understand since I've gone gluten-free
An American Pie ? Won't be biting into that.
I'm sorry. I've had to give up gluten.
Now I'm supposed to take a bite of your cream pie?
It's my first hyper-local pie.
I was told He was crusty.
All that knowledge, and all you come up with is a @#*!%$z pie?
So it's only seven percent eternal damnation?
Hath it no gluten?
I hope it is an apple pie.
Did you ever feel you were just on the most fertile ground to drop a good "pick-up" line, but still might blow it?
It's blueberry.
Very tempting, but I'm watching my weight.
I'm about ready to be done with this raw food kick too but is it our cheat day already?
Well, I think its okay if it's gluten free.
You baked Him another apple pie? Goodbye for good, Eden.
Is that gluten free?
Whoa!! A value-added product!
That's impressive, but I'm gluten-free.
Actually it could be any kind of pie.
You’re going to burn your hands, sweetheart—they haven’t invented potholders yet.
I'd love to, but God told me to avoid gluten.
Is that apple pie?
Is that ANOTHER recipe you found on Sinterest??
Is it American pie?
We can outsmart that serpent. Let's create a smash-hit comedy and not actually eat the pie.
Do you have any flavors other than apple?
I'd like to make a counter-offer.
let's see, pi equals 3.14159, so....
Seems chancy... ya know with the whole nakedness and paradise thing.
Are you sure you picked the right berries? I see the vultures heading this way!
Meat, vegetables, and...apples! How did you bake it?
What that snake serves up is NOT 'As American As Apple Pie'.
I guess you're right, he only said not to eat it raw right off the tree, he'd didn't say anything not eating it cooked.
Never mind, I'm not hungry.
That looks tempting, but I'm gluten-free these days.
He'll have to forgive us after tasting this forbidden fruit pie
Why am I thinking Snake Oil
Uh oh. Give that to the snake. I have to run to the orchard.
Sorry, I'm in a cherry mood today.
A la mode?
I hope that is not a fruit pie
Can I have ice cream with it?
That better be a dam good pie.
Um, did I say apple? I meant peach.
It's so like Him to forget the fork.
I can't remember. What is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter called?
Oh, I forgot to mention . . . I only like apple!
I'm trying to cut back on gluten.
Eve, is that gluten free crust!
OK, you're right. I can be tempted by the flakey crust recipe from the Food Network
If you make a gluten-free version, THEN I'll be tempted to eat it.
Is that your pie?
As Eden as apple pie
you little snake..what a surprise!
Well, the McIntosh apples aren't exactly forbidden, but they are lousy for baking.
I was hoping for a figgy pudding pie.
It's tempting but too many carbs.
Where does It go?
Gee...let me guess... is it an apple pie??!!
OMG! I forgot the ice cream.
"??p!" - " WTF!" ??
Did you already eat one? Cuz how do you know how to bake?
Um... I prefer cherry.
Thanks very much, but I have already had dessert.
I appreciate the effort. But, I already said I'd eat the apple.
Unfortunately, I don't think the ability to make an apple pie will convince U.S. Immigration that we aren't a threat.
Decisions! Decisions!....Where's the blond with the apple?
Gosh, Eve, that's really sweet, but is it gluten-free?
I'm not that crazy about apples but I will try it.
Fried, boiled or baked, Snake is splitting hairs. The warning was, "No apple eating."
O.K.? Now I'm totally confused?
So, Satan presumes knowledge enters finite creatures in slices.
''Apple? Didn't you say cherry this morning?''
Well, it certainly is tempting. And you're sure it was not made from THAT apple!
Come on, you know you want to
OMG, this is sinfully delicious!
Nice pie.
Did you say Apple Pie!
MayI have that ala mode?
I prefer mine half-baked.
I understand about not eating them from the tree, but no one can resist fresh baked goods.
Something tells me the pie's not gluten free either.
Any chance that's gluten free?
We won't have enough so lets split that before we create civilization.
Let me guess. Peach? Blueberry?
You know I prefer peach.
Original Tin
I hope it's gluten-free,
For me? You really shouldn't have.
Adam, freshly baked apple pie from McDonalds!!
See tasting that apple wasn't all bad!
Oh, come on. It's gluten free.
Can't you just bake a cake for once in your life?
Well, my trainer told me it does not count as a fruit if it is in a pie.
No. Cooking obliterates most of the vitamins in food.
What do we eat it with?
Please tell me its a cheery pie
Ok I know it's a peach pie but...
Darnit! I should have picked up some ice cream when I was at the Mini-Mart!
Tell me it's gluten free.
I sure hope you didn't use those apples from that beady eyed neighbor of ours.
I can't eat that right now, I'm in a state of ketosis.
Sorry, I only consume gluten-free food products and ethically-sourced produce.
I know apple pies are forbidden, but this a fine-apple pie.
You didn't bake this the Oven of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, right?
Don't worry, it's organic, local strawberry-rhubarb.
Yeah, technically it's not "an apple" but it the principle of the thing that counts.
Oh no! I forgot my Viagra!
I thought we weren't supposed to have gluten..
Is it pear?
Not al a mode? Uh, no thanks.
And you are absolutely sure it does not contain any Gluten?
Apple IS my favorite Eve, but you know I’m gluten intolerant.
Oh no, not apple pie!
This is not what I had in mind when you said let's have a picnic in the park.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't apple pie contain apples?
I swear it'll be worth it, it even has gluten.
Do we have any ice cream in the fridge?
Tempting, doll, but I got a shot at being Trump's new press guy, and I gotta go get a dark suit.
"The disclaimer says...Eat the pie leave the garden." # Nahash pie shop
I said Pecan Pie, not Apple!
I don't remember you saying that having sex for the first time would be a piece of pie.

I prefer blueberry.
I hope this works!
I can't think of anything that would trump this day in America.
I've never heard of a dingleberry pie. What's in it?
Smells tempting, but where did you get the recipe for that?
I'm apple intolerant!
Another pie? I wanted to celebrate with cake.
Thanks for the pie, and do I have something for you.
Does it have gluten?
Yes your profile did mention a pie fetish
Your reconstruction theory is certainly not half baked.
Oh dear, is it gluten-free?
Uh, wow looks tempting, you did say it's blueberry right?
Since when does a femme fatale like to cook?
Uh, I don't know. Is it gluten free?
After dinner, do you mind if I put on some of your things?
Do I have to know what's inside?
Hey, that's not made from those apples, is it?
Oh my heavens, is that gooseberry?
Try it! You'll like it!
I'm worried we're becoming too traditional.
You're sure there aren't any apples in there
Uh, gluten free right?
You bake?
The snake’s order for you was an apple, not a blueberry pie, and it was for just one apple, because sadly, you’re no longer a 10.
"I'm trying to avoid the carbs but I'll have a bite anyway".
There is no note. I think we can eat it.
My mom's recipe had less cinnamon.
Um...sorry Eve but you know I'm gluten free.
Well...since you say it's gluten-free, it couldn't hurt to try a piece...
Are you sure? ... I explicitly remember Him saying something about the pie of the knowledge of good and evil.
Should I name it America or apple pie?
Lemme get this straight. The snake said if we eat this pie, we'll become world-famous desserters?
Uh, gluten free right?
What is it's glycemic index?
well... He didn't say anything about baking the fruit
That would be so much better with some ice cream on top, which I haven't gotten around to inventing yet.
Okay, okay, but are you sure it's gluten free?
I'm having a Deja vu.
Pi? Isn't it a bit early for Greeks bearing gifts?
I think I'll pass.
I was looking for 24 blackbirds when I came across an apple tree.
He didn't tell you? We're sugar- and gluten-free now.
Sex begins in the kitchen.
No, you have it all wrong. I said I wanted to have my cake and eat it, too.
The apple alone I was able to resist, but now pie. Maybe. But don't dare put a scoop of ice cream on it.
Apple Pie? I love the crust.
What the devil is this pie-shaped object?
This is going to lead to a series of teen gross-out comedies

American Pie? Your friend says I should put what in it?
Gluten? Mightn't we be banished?

The hell with apple pie, give me the Chevy.
Here, have some of this then we need to talk about "bad naked".
Forbidden fruit pie, huh? Is it organic?
I did not know you could bake
Wish I waited for the pie!
How to win the war.
Forget what you know and do what you feel.
Forbidden is okay, but are there pine nuts?
Apple? He said he hates apple.
To bite or not to bite ...
Is it gluten-free, though?
Love at first sniff.
As long as it's no-gluten, I guess.
No garden ingredients. Looks delicious!
If we eat now, we can still dress before we leave for our vacation out east.
Is that the snake's apple pie? I'd like a bite of that."
I am so done with this vegan diet....
'Definitely a conundrum!'
How'd you learn to bake like that?
Apple pie? What is an apple pie?
Take it, pal. Trust me, it's a lot better than the first one.
Relax. It's gluten-free.
It’s just what my mom would have made.
Where's the ice cream?
A tragic misunderstanding that will haunt all men for eternity!
Smells great, but where's my fork?
But then, who gave the cooking class?
I bet you'd like it if your Father made it.
I'm supposed to be tempted by a apple, not an alternative apple!

Better than Lilith's? She couldn't make a mud pies to save her soul.
....or as an "alternative" to the real thing....
Sooo tempting. But c'mon, you know I don't do gluten.
The snake has a message of hope for us!

But we GOTTA have ice-cream!
IT'S OK ... IT'S AN APPLE PIE!

ummm, I thought we were Paleo.
Yelp.
Babe, you know I'm doing Paleo this week.
Relax, dude. It's gluten free.
kellyanne, weren't you "counseled" about that?
Did you get that from Martha Stewart Living Forever?
No, I can't. I'm taking the WholeKnowledgeofGoodandEvil30 challenge.
I tried one before making the pie.
Not exactly what I was hoping for.
Is it really cherry?
Sorry, I'm not performing perverted acts with that pie.
Is this because I forgot Valentine's Day?
I'm mostly afraid of the gluten.
I don't think you can bake it out.
Blueberry. Huh.
Ummm... knowledge- and gluten-free?
"This is quite tempting, but I'm gluten intolerant".
OMG Eve, what did you do with the apple? I said this is the Garden of Eden, not the Garden of Eatin'!!
Hm, I don't recall naming an oven....

You baked the knot from my throat?
Now THAT'S Pie à la Mode!
I’d like to know what’s behind that pie.
What a revoltin' development this is!
I said The Big Guy is okay with peaches, not apples!
If that's your mother's recipe, I'm so outta here.
It's not from the Tree Of Gluten, is it?
We have any whipped cream for that?
So you're saying that if the apples are cooked in, it doesn't count?
I thought we were on a diet!
Um...is this the part where pussy grabs back?
I thought I was gonna cook and you’d wash the dishes?!

Sorry, I don't do alternative facts.
I don't know, god, my personal trainer says I need to watch the calories.
I'm thinking Rhubarb this time.
I prefer apple butter.
So, will eating this explain numerical value or just regret?
look the apple, turned in to a pie.
I remember what happened after the last apple but this smells too good to pass up!
Are you sure it's glutten-free?
Isn't this a little soon?
At least we'll have rent money.
Isn't this a little soon?

Can I tempt you with some pie?
My, that's tempting, more than that wormy apple you tried to foist off on me yesterday.
They recommended this at the App Store
"Thanks , but I was using pie metaphorically " .
How can you be sure it's gluten free?
I don't think that can beat the apple pie you made for me yesterday.
Sorry, I'm off gluten.
I got the secret recipe from Satan himself.
Maybe the snake is lying when he says the pie contains no apples.
Take a bite and tell me what a delicious cherry pie.
I'm really sorry, it smelled like peach.
But, what if all we're ever remembered for is introducing gluten into the world?
Thanks, but I was really hoping for motherhood
Look, the snake said the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. I don't care if the other tree had a Michelin star.
Please tell me that's a 4 and 20 blackbird pie!
It is in pie form so I guess so.
Um...uh, yeah. Are you cheating on me?
No, I'm sorry, I should have told you about my thing with cardamom.
You know I hate cherries!

Apple pie again!
You're the best rib a guy could ask for.
sugar and fat stuff?
That forbidden fruit pie better be gluten free.
I don't really like mock apple pie.
I've never had sexual relations with that pie!

"No thanks". "I'm gluten-intolerant".
...so tempting. I'll have a slice if it is gluten-free, vegan and all organic.
Don't you think we've had enough humble pie?
Why are you tempting me with apple pie?
Nothing personal, I'm just feeling a little full from lunch.
It's amazing what one apple will get you in the,"Garden of Eating.""
You've got to stop watching Martha Stewart and get back to the basics.
Are you sure that's gluten free?
Tempting, but, really, I had lunch at the office and couldn't eat another bite.
"You sure it's gluten free?" The word "sure" should be emphasized as your editors see fit.

I don't know what to say.
No thanks. I'm trying to cut out the carbs.
Golly, gee -- an apple pie! But all I said was you're the apple of my EYE!
Uh. Thanks, but, is it gluten-free?
Was that a " Pie in The Sky?"
I picked a back week to start cutting carbs.
Okay, one guess? Blueberry.
Methinks if it's four-and-twenty blackbirds, we're home free!
I'd really prefer to try it for real this time.
I wanted blueberry.
Again? I forgot. I have a headache. Serpent, you are not helping.
Any chance it's gluten-free?
No bad apples here!
Sorry, I just can't visualize a bakery and coffee cafe in a place called Paris.
It smells great, but I'd hate to be banished.
And after Eve had eaten of the forbidden fruit, the serpent, knowing that the way to a man's soul was through his stomach, said to Eve, "Bake the fruit from the tree of knowledge in a pie before giving it to Adam."
(It figures carbs were involved.)
Thanks but I'm allergic to gluten.
Apple? Baked where?
Something tells me i shouldn't eat it...Is it gluten- free?
Apple? I thought you meant cherry pie?
Damn, why couldn't he have chosen rhubarb.
I don't know, Eve. Does it have gluten?
Looks and smells great.Is that your mother's recipe? WAIT A MINUTE.
I dunno, pie? I just don't want this moral lesson obscured by a patriarchal trope.
