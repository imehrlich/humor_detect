Yes, I see the train but I think we can beat it.
Well technically, you ran the red light.
I'll order. You pick up.
We finished in first and third place.
You can knock off the heavy breathing back there, Gwendolyn. I know you're not pedaling.
This would be a lot easier if you dropped the restraining order.
I'll place the order, you pick up
"I told you it was a long bike ride." - Arman Roberts, age 6
Yes, dear, I'll call you as soon as I get there.
Your profile said you enjoy long bike rides.
I'm beginning to think you're running those yellow lights intentially.
You can do whatever you want, but I'm taking the next right.
Got any ideas for the upcoming traffic circle?
We are not doing a wheelie. Don't call me again.
Since you'll be home first, can you start dinner?
When you say "turn here," is that your "here" or my "here"?
What do you mean--a metaphor for our relationship?
Pothole in 10 seconds.
You seem distant today.
Hi, it's me. I'm running a little behind.
'For God Sakes Harry! Pull up your shorts!!'
If I remove beans from my diet, can we ride our old bike?
I'm going into a tunnel, I might lose you.
We're not gonna be late. You're gonna be late.
Where were you when I called a few minutes ago?
A trial separation was your idea.
I said, "I THINK EXERCISE IS BRINGING US CLOSER TOGETHER."
I'm way ahead of you on that.
Thanks for calling. I wasn’t sure you made it through that last intersection.
Yes, I'll accept a long-distance call.
I thought you said you enjoyed long bike rides.
No, we're not there yet!
I think I can make the light.
When I arrive, I'll tell them you're coming.
Remember, no more yellow lights.
Next time, we go to the bike shop, not one of those big chain stores.
That's weird. I've got four bars.
Pull up your shorts.
I got your text. What's up?
My wife and I hit a bump at 45 mph--I'd like to report four missing children.
Sorry, I'm going to lose you. I'm about to go into a tunnel.
It was green when I went through it.
We're screwed when we hit Lombard Street.
You have reached the voicemail of Alicia Crandall. If you would like her to pedal faster, press 1 now.
See honey, this way I can have the space I need, but you can still feel connected
Now let go of the brake. The elastic will do the rest.
You said you wanted to go for a long bike ride.
I'll be home in ten...your mother in twelve.
You sound distant.
Was I there yet?
I agree; we are drifting apart but at least we are doing it together.
I told you that I just need some space.
I'm gonna turn left at 11.28, your time.
It was green for me!
How did you get my number?
The race results were posted online. I took 3rd place; you finished 10th.
"I know I'm always distant but have I ever steered you wrong"?
I'm losing you.
It's clear we've grown further apart.
Its on our way. How about, I order the pizza but you have to pick it up?
Wait a second, you'll see.
Hold your breath in about two seconds.
Pick up the pace. You're falling behind.
Call when you get there.
I'm in front so of course I'm going faster than you.
What do you mean, 'We've grown apart'?
I can't hear you. Text me!
Let me get back to you.
... and with only 2 bars I could lose you.
FOR THE LAST TIME....YOU DON'T NEED DIECTIONS!
Oh sorry! I butt dialed you.
You just ran a red light back there.
You seem distant lately.
Pick up the pace. You're falling behind.
Bump.
I guess I misunderstood when you said long bike ride.
It'll bring us closer together, you said.
I think we are in first and last place.
I'm not calling again...Shift the damn gears.
Get ready. I'm going to pop a wheelie.
People are starting to notice we're separated.
Melania invented it.
Let's hope we find a place to turn around before dusk.
They all say you aren't pedaling!
I don't get it. How much more space do you need?
There's a drawbridge ahead. Good luck to you.
Run another yellow light and I'm off this thing.
Thanks, but I'm way ahead of you.
Wait....you're where?
You said you wanted space!
Pick up the pace, you're getting out of cell range.
There's a bump in five seconds.
Fine-no more running yellow lights.
When I texted you, '...we need some space' this was not what I had in mind.
I can't talk, I think she's listening.
It should snap back when I hit the brakes
Look, you agreed to a trial separation.
We do everything together Mom, he's still distant.
Drive-thru window ahead.  I'll order and you pay.
"You know, now that I see it coming, I guess this isn't the best bike for Dead Man's Curve.
I admit it, I misunderstood 'long bike ride.'
Try to keep up.
If you haven't left the house yet can you grab me a water.
Cindy, I need to be up frontwith you.
Stop telling me to be careful. I have not run a single red light today and you have run four.
I'm calling from your future...
No, it's you pedal, I steer.
I've arrived.
Better hurry. I hear a train coming.
Are you pedaling?
I don't like it either, but I told you last night, dairy doesn't agree with me.
Uh, could you release the rear brake, please?
Our next custom bike shouldn't be made by someone going through a divorce.
Knock it off with the backseat driving!
U-turn? I don't know, it's a bit of a stretch.
Is this what you meant when you said you wanted to go for a long bike ride?
We're now both exiting and entering Rhode Island.
It was you who wanted a trial separation.
I thought I told you never to call me here.
Let's eat inside. The drive-thru is a real pain.
Let the brake off.
I understand, but legally I don't have to stop at a yellow light.
Siri says make a u-ey.
Yeah, I think we just figured out why it was so cheap.
Don't you love these long bike rides?
I was sure your profile said experimental bisexual.
No, YOU are paying the ticket. It was green when I went through.
I'll see you there!
OK, OK. I'll stop trying to make it through the intersections when the light turns yellow.
I'm going to try and run this red light, okay?
How much farther to the marriage counselor?
But your profile said you like long bike rides.
You do realize I'll be coming in first.
Fred, where's the baby?
I like spending time with you too, honey.
He is on the phone. Can I take a message?
The roaming fees are killing us!"
Pump your brakes—some jerk in a stretch limo is blocking the road.
Should I start dinner when I get home?
A hole in my shorts? How big?
You and your engineering degree!
Hello, who's calling?
I wish you'd keep up.
Limobikes do have their limitations, madame.
How did the rental guy say we turn again?
Relatively speaking the faster you pedal the quicker I'll hear you
I know the judge said 50 feet, but this is ridiculous.
No Dear, I cherish our together time....
Run one more yellow light and I'm filing for a divorce!
Trust me. It's straight the whole way.
Wanted to warn you, in 5 seconds you may smell something.
Slow down, turn left, watch out for the dog, are you listening?
Try to keep up.
This isn't what I thought you meant by long distance cycling!
We need to talk.
Hey, I don't think this trial separation is working out so well.
I told you, it was for my first wife.
When can I see you again?
I think I can make the light.
I think we stretched too much before exercising.
Yes, yes, I did suggest a nice, long bike ride. But, do you have to take everything so literally Darren?
But, I want you to WANT to pedal
That light was green when I went through it.
What? I said it'd be a long bicycle ride.
It's a bicycle built for two who can't stand each other.
You should get a stronger signal in a second.
Miss you, too!
Did you check the dimensions when you ordered this bike online?
Can you steer me? Can you steer me now?
I miss you.
I thought we were going on a LONG bike ride, not a LONG BIKE ride!
We used to be so close.
Can you let the dog out when you get home?
You're good up there but I just ran my tenth red light.
Call me when you get home
It's not you, it's me. I just feel like we're in different places right now.
I just thought we needed some space.
Turn left!!!
I swear to God, Karen, one more wheelie and we're getting a divorce
Pothole in 10 seconds.
Can you imagine doing this sort of thing before cell phones?
You seem more distant lately.
Tunnel coming up, I'll call you back.
I think it's time that we seriously confront our intimacy issues.
I feel confident we can beat that train across the tracks.
Please stop calling to say you miss me.
Well, it was green when I went through!
God, how I hate back seat drivers!
Yes, I'm married, but we're separated....
Yes, I'll accept a long-distance call.
Your pace or mine?
I'll text you when I get there.
Rubber bike? You bought a rubber damn tandem bike?
Yes, I still love you."
Who's calling, please?
Actually, I don't think this is bringing us closer together.
Sorry about that. I had a chili for dinner last night.
You're "out of area."
Watch out for hills where I go up and you go down.
This is not what I meant by a trial separation.
I just feel like you've always been holding me back.
Okay I'll meet you there.
No U-tuns OK?
Talk lower, I can still hear you.
Roger that, no more bean soup.
This isn't what I meant when I suggested longer bike rides.
What time will you be home?
It isn't you. I just feel we're no longer in tandem.
All right. No more going through yellow lights.
That you think this is romantic is precisely the problem.
Last one home makes dinner!
Let me know when we've finished crossing the finish line.
Honey, the stretched limos were all booked.
Is this what the couples counselor meant by taking time together and apart?
I am going to try to beat the light.
Are you even pedaling?
Worst rideshare ever.
I miss the old days when you rode on my handlebars.
Have you smelled it yet?
The marriage counselor was right, honey. Distance does help.
Wide turns. Remember, wide turns.
Mostly fine with a few clouds. How is it there?
I'm starting to lose you.
Sorry. It was green when I went through it.
What do you mean we need to make a u-turn?
I'll put the coffee on and wait for you
The millennial tandem. No interaction needed, cell phones not included.
You never look at me anymore.
I can't talk now, I think I'm being followed.
Is this what you meant by separate but equal?
I may lose you at this next intersection.
Thank God I just missed that truck. Oh . . .
So it's an extended metaphor.
What do you mean, 'hairpin turn ahead?'
Can we not run yellow lights, please?
Text me when you arrive.
You said you wanted to go for a long bike ride.
I think we're ready for two bikes.
I can understand if you need more space.
I've been meaning to tell you I need more space.
No, I don't want to take another long bike ride tomorrow.
"For the thousandth time, yes, the doctor said "long bike rides'".
Am I going too fast?
Pedal faster. You're falling behind.
It's an Einstein thing. What time do you have?
I'm enjoying this time together.
I'll meet you at the corner.
Did you fart?
Sorry - I thought "the limo of bicycles" meant luxury.
I'm sensing we're drifting farther apart.
It's a bicycle built for too far.
Does the bicycle make my butt look smaller?
Hey, did you stop peddling?
A bicycle built for tweets
I wish you would reconsider the restraining order.
This wasn't what I envisioned when you said a long bike ride.......
Apparently, the bar is retractable, in case we decide to reconcile.
You know, this is the closest I've felt to you since we got married
About 75 degrees, slight wind. How is it back there?
Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself
It still looks fat
You should of thought of that before we headed to Lombard Street.
Where are you?
I comply with the restraining order, you should comply with the pedaling order.
The roaming charges are going to kill us.
I know the therapist said to balance being alone and in tandem, but this is ridiculous
But we ARE doing an activity together right now and this IS talking.
I love it when we spend quality time together.
I think this cartoon is Somewhat Funny. How are you voting?
We're In a long distance relationship
Could you please take your hand off the brake?
I need a bathrom. Can you get home by yourself?
Remember, when you cross the border -- wait!
Stan and Mary finally admitted to themselves that a long distance relationship just worked better for them.
What does the manual say about u-turns?
I told you this would be a long bike ride.
These new Tandems are great for couples who tried separate beds but wanted something more.
When you said the estimated time of arrival is 3:05 pm, did you mean yours or mine?
At the corner this time let's both turn left.
Do not-- I repeat --DO NOT go through any yellow lights!
You'll need sunglasses in a second.
Well, you're the one who wanted the separation agreement.
Remember, if I turn right, you steer LEFT.
Yes, yes, I'm sure. Whichever way I turn, you turn the opposite. Just like a fire truck.
Daisy? Daisy? Is that really you? I'm half crazy, but I think we need a crew. We won't win any medals. At least we both have peddles. You're a block behind, but that is just fine on this cycle built for two.
You seem distant.
Do you want my estimated time of arrival or yours?
Let's use the drive through for lunch, you pay, I'll pick-up.
You seem a little distant lately.
These roaming charges are killing me.
Let's pop a wheelie.
I'll give you a call when we get there.
No, I miss you more.
Yeah...this isn't what I meant by spending time apart.
Wait. You're getting ahead of me.
These helmets really make us look stupid.
We're doing a trail separation
I think I'm being followed.
I'm just asking you to let me know next time you plan to pop a wheelie.
I'm feeling good about this yellow light.
You're being distant this morning.
I think I'll still get there first.
You just hate taking directions from a woman don't you!
Did you get my text?
I'm pregnant.
I'm going for coffee. You coming?
What do you mean you peed already?
I told you never to call me at this number.
You said this would bring us together
Did you just say, 'we're breaking up?'
Try to catch up.
I'll pick up the bread and cheese while you stop at the liquor store.
We need to have that talk about yellow lights.
Have your lawyer call my lawyer
I gotta go, this is long distance.
I just called to say I love you.
I thought you said a hobby would bring us closer together.
What do you want at the drive-thru?
And you've been so distant lately....
This isn't what I meant when I said 'time apart.'
"I'm starting to feel some separation anxiety".
Sorry honey - the light was green when I went.
You're breaking up. I'll call you later.
Okay, no yellow lights.
This 'statement' we're trying to make... Tell me again what it is?
What do you mean this doesn't count as quality time?
We're currently in both first and last place.
Finally...a moment to ourselves.
You walk the dog, you'll be home before I am.
Please stop BEFORE the train tracks.
You stretch everything when you're a Trump, Barron. Get used to it.
Follow me.
I can't talk now, I'm going into a tunnel.
Last one there buys lunch.
Uh-oh—I forgot about the traffic circle.
...and don't forget we've got couples' therapy at 6:30.
I'll text you if I see a bump.
Well, Charlene, maybe YOU should have taken a closer look at the Groupon!
It most certainly was green when I crossed!
Pay attention. It's a long distance call.
It was on sale at Costco
You said you needed more space.
Hold on, I think I can just make it through this yellow light.
What do you mean we never communicate?
Isn’t it great to be able to spend time together?
We're turning onto Lombard Street and you're not going to like it.
I'm just saying you're undermining the spirit of the restraining order
Text me when you get there.
'Wrong number'
I love that we're doing things together.
Catch up! It says you're out of my service area.
I think we should move in together.
Isn't it great to finally spend some time together, honey?
I'll stop for brunch and you stop for lunch.
These Citibikes are too big to fail.
Cut beans out of your diet and we'll talk.
OK, I'm going to make a left in ten, nine, eight, seven ......
I might lose you. I've got only 1 bar.
Again, I'm sorry the stretch limo was unavailable.
How much longer will you be contagious?
U-turn ahead.
I know, you need your space.
I view this as a trial separation, not the end of the road.
I think this trip is really bringing us closer together.
I'll try to have dinner ready by the time you get home.
You should have thought this through when you took out that restraining order.
Last one there buys drinks!
Daisy? Is that you?
Ok I'm done. Call me when you get here.
Your pants just split.
Exciting? Ok, but can we agree on a yellow light strategy now?
You're breaking up...try getting to a place with better reception.
I told you never to call me here.
Always I heard that behind a great man there is a great woman but honey, this is ridiculous.
Don't you think this trial separation is getting rediculous?
Pedal faster. You're falling behind.
When you get to where I am, you'll have four bars.
This wasn't precisely what I meant when I said I wanted some space.
Ok. We are headed into the final stretch.
Sometimes I feel like I'm doing all the work in this relationship.
This wasn't what I had in mind when I suggested we go for a long bike ride.
It's a matter of perspective
I'm calling to remind you not to use your phone while cycling.
Maybe it's the distance, but I feel like we're both spinning our wheels.
Steerer to Rear, Steerer to Rear, do you copy?
Are you sure you're ok ? You seem distant.
I thought YOU had the baby.
It's a stretch, but I know we can improve our communication skills. Just follow my lead.
Daisy...Daisy? Are you there?
Watcha doin' ?
I'll let them know you're on your way.
You're falling behind. Pick up the pace!
They need us to be there by noon and 12:01.
Are you finally convinced a divorce would be better than a separation.
I know it's prom, but the stretch limo was more than I could afford.
Get this. Now she thinks I have issues with intimacy.
You're the one who wanted more space.
I vote we go around the hill instead of over it.
Daisy, Daisy, is this your answer true?
This isn't what I had in mind when I said that I needed space.
I told you you couldn't keep up!
It doesn't work if you brake while I'm pedaling.
We've got a terrible connection.
Bob, do NOT try to beat that oncoming train!
Did you fart a while ago?
OK, look on the left ... we're approaching that stretch limo. I'll wave to the driver; you make faces at the guy in the back seat!
Oops, I just ran a red light.
I don't think this is what the therapist meant by spending time apart.
Funny, I've got four bars.
Peddle faster...the light just turned yellow!!
We’re sorry. You must first dial a 1 before calling this number.
All I'm saying is I need some space.
I said 'trial separation' not trail.
It's a bicycle built for two with a restraining order.
Left turn at the corner.
I'm about to go into a tunnel, so I might lose you.
I'm not lost, we don't need to ask for directions.
Lean in.
Einstein was right.
It's not an activity for couples if you have to lead every time
The therapist said this would save our marriage?!
Did you see the dachshund chasing us back there?
No... the light was green.
We're just going to blast through this red light.
Sorry, thought this might bring us closer.
Honey, this is not what I meant by spending more time together.
I know we agreed to give each other some space, but this is getting ridiculous.
I told you never to call me here.
I just feel like we're growing apart.
Lactose intolerant? What gave it away?
Alright, look happy, the Jones' house is coming up!
This would go more smoothly if you didn't have your foot on the brake the whole time.
I don't think you're going to make the light. I'll wait for you on the other side of the intersection.
If I order takeout, can you pick it up?
Whattaya mean cell phones create distance between people? Who is this?
Call me when you get home
Just made it to Michigan. How are things in Ohio?
I misunderstood what you meant when you asked if I wanted to go in a long bike ride
Let's stop at the coffee shop up ahead. I'll save you a seat.
You know I don't like it when you back seat drive.
I sense some real distance between us.
I'll be home early.
This is not what I pictured when you said long bike ride.
Don't forget to pick up milk on your way home.
I told you to keep your distance but this is ridiculous.
Gotta go. I think someone's following me.
Wait up!
I'm just not sure this long distance thing is working out.
You were right--it's not as fun as a stretch limo.
I think we should get a different marriage counsellor.
Just follow me.
I can't talk now. I have some catching up to do.
Hold tight. Here comes another dead zone.
Let's not stay long at this party. I'll do the 'hellos' and you do the 'goodbyes.'
Daisy, Daisy---can you hear me?
It's a trial separation. You lead after next corner.
Is this what you meant by a long bike ride?
You're still in violation of the restraining order.
Your restraining order says 50 ft... that's why!
I don't know... you just seem so distant lately.
I know we can beat that train. Don't worry about it
I just don't understand why we come in first and third every single year.
Take one more sharp turn like that, Larry, and I will kill you!
I think our trial separation is really moving us forward.
If you want to catch up to me, you'll have to peddle faster.
I thought you said riding a tandem would bring us closer together.
Four the thousandth and last time, I am peddling!
I feel like I'm pulling all of the weight in the relationship.
I think we're taking this whole personal space thing too far.
I'm sorry, I think we're breaking up.
I'll order the pizza if you pick it up.
I feel that you're pulling away from me.
Dude, some real bad curves coming up, hang on.
I'll see you later.
I'm sorry, but the light was still green when I entered the intersection.
Is this what they mean by 'six degrees of separation'?
The therapist said to give each other more space
You need to make a left at the light. I'm going to go straight ahead!
You've seemed so distant lately.
You try to make it through another yellow light and we're getting a divorce.
Yes, I had a bean burrito for lunch ... but this is ridiculous!
I'm not interested in a long-distance relationship.
I'm glad we found a way to make our long-distance relationship work.
This trial separation isn't working, I want my own bike.
We'll be there in 10 or 15 minutes.
....and I want two hotel rooms.
Since I’ll be home before you, I’ll let the dog out.
Miss you, too!
GPS shows I'm on pace to beat the train but should really kick it.
Did you get my text?
I'll be in Scotland a'fore ye.
Wanted to ask you to answer the phone with your right hand so we don't lose our balance
So do you think my butt looks big in these pants?
Take your hands off the brakes!
I thought being in tandem meant we would have the same cell plan.
That was a big bump -- how'd the kids do?
This is not what I had in mind when you asked me to join you on a long bike tour of New York.
Hold on, I'm going through a tunnel.
'I don't think this long distance relationship thing is gonna work'.
We get there when we get there!
Honey, you know how hard it is to manage a long-distance relationship while traveling.
Pedal faster.
Hello. Who is this?
What do mean its a long distance call?
No, I've never heard the expression "Old cog and chain."
If we wanna win this thing, you need to drop the restraining order.
No, I'm still here.
Let's try and see if we can pop a wheelie!
Everything ok? You seem really distant.
Don't you think it's time you dropped the restraining order?
Honey, let go the brake.
Why are you calling? Just text me the directions
Honey, I said text, don't call.
Lately, you seem distant.
It was a good idea but, no, you're just going to have to stop eating beans.
I'll tell the Mathesons that you're running a little late because of traffic.
The couples therapist said he thought it'd be a good way for us to ease back in to doing things together.
I can't help but feel we've grown apart.
Are you peddling now?
Are we almost there?
No, I have not figured out what to tell the bus driver.
Well, stop using the brakes so much
We need to signal for a right turn.
Let me know when we arrive
We used to be so close.
How does my tush look now?
Heads up...tight corner ahead!
There's a hairpin turn ahead. Text me if you don't make it.
This is only until the TRO expires.
Pull over...I have a wedgie
I get it, you need some space, but this still feels a little codependent to me.
How are things at your end?
Why are you following me?
I'm so glad we finally found time to do something together
When the marriage counselor said we should do things together, I don't think this is what he had in mind.
Thiiiiis neeeeew waaaarp driiiiiive iiiiis reeeeaaaaalllly cooooooool!!!!!
I can make this light but WE can't!
Call when you get there.
Why is it so hard to get close to you?
Isn’t this great? The wind in your face, the sun on your shoulders, the distant sound of your spouse.
There's a train coming up ahead. I'll go first.
Hon, I have to tell you that you are now part of my extended family!
I'll check, Mom, but I think she's on the phone with her father.
Donald Trump is a jackass.
You should see the house.
Why don't YOU stop and ask for directions.
A self-powered limo sounded good in theory.
I don't think this is what the marriage counselor meant when he suggested space.
A U-turn, now?
I'll stop the sharp turns once you ease off the brakes.
We're approaching the Fire Station, be ready. They'll be laughing at us again.
What do you mean we're drifting apart?
I'm having a chain reaction
I'll wait for you to catch up.
What do you mean it's still not enough space?
I can still smell you from here.
Hurry up Sevn. You're going to miss the big Finnish.
Congratulations Mr. and Mrs. Snyder! You are the first people to come in both first and last in our town's annual bike race!
Isn't it enough that we're sleeping in separate beds?!?
These long distance relationships are hard.
No, I haven't forgotten the plumber's coming by this afternoon. Why do you ask?
I thought you wanted a trial separation!
It's become obvious that we're drafting apart.
I can still smell you.
Next time you should specify that you want a stretch-LIMO to the airport
What's the point of a trial separation bike if you're going to be calling me all the time?
Thank you for keeping me on as chauffeur during these rough times, madam.
It will get worse as we get closer to lightspeed.
Yes, I'll tell them you'll be 30 seconds late.
No,a left at the next intersection,and swing wide this time, damn it!
I know you 'need some space', but the turns are murder.
I'm just not ready to get back together yet.
I'll phone you to let you know when I arrive.
Sorry about running that yellow light."
Heads up I'm going to try and do a wheelie.
Just calling to let you know I need my space.
Going the wrong way? I'm going the same way you are!
What do you mean you've been braking so we don't go back down the hills?
Hey you in the back......get off the brake!
I feel there is a distance between us.
Must go! Someone's following me!
I told you I need some space!
It's not my imagination ... I'm sure somebody is following me.
Did you call your mother?
I'll go ahead an get a table and wait for you to arrive.
I'm not sure if this will help us decide if we can sustain a long distance relationship.
Try to catch up. We'll be in a poor reception area soon.
I said, do you ever feel we're drifting apart?
This is why I hate riding with a plumber in the front.
Oh, sure, missing the turn to the marriage counselor is MY fault...
I guess you could call it a long distance relationship.
I tried pedaling faster, mom. He's still right behind me!
Hold on, I have to make a U - turn.
I need more space.
The good news is that the upcoming hairpin turn over the canyon is the only one on today's tour.
You said you needed a little space, didn't you?
So this is your idea of a trial separation.
I just crossed into Rhode Island. Have you left New York yet?
I think we should go straight.
Do we need milk?
We can just clear that train. Faster!
If you get home before me, can you let the dog out?
I don't think this is what the therapist meant when she said we need to give each other space.
Can't talk. Roaming charges.
Do you mean 4:00 your time or my time?
What do you mean you feel like you're getting farther and farther behind?
I just think we need a little time apart.
I'll call you when I get home.
I still say it would have been cheaper to just buy deodorant.
I’m going to try to make this light.
I told you there's a difference between distancing oneself and getting completely detached
Remember to brake this time when the elastic band pulls back.
I've only got 2 bars. How many do you have?
She's fine, but we've decided to separate.
Are we there yet?" "I don't know about you. I am
He's going the distance...he's going for speed.
I feel like we're drifting apart.
No problem, I'll start dinner.
Craig, Lisa, and their stupid 37ft bike won't know what hit them.
Honey, are you still following me?
Is this your idea of a trial separation?
No, you can stop before the train tracks
yes, but you're ALWAYS a few minutes late
Sorry, butt dial
I can still see your calf tattoo
See if there's a brakes app.
No, I can't slow down, damn it!
Let's try to beat the train.
And where, exactly, were you planning on parking it?
No, you were the one who insisted on separate vacations.
Do you have an extra water bottle
Best restraining order ever!
Remember that roundabout I mentioned?
Let's call our therapists and tell them they were both right. Distance from each other and exercise is improving our relationship.
This isn't what I meant when I said I wanted us to feel more connected to each other.
These bike rides have gotten longer since the separation.
Let's be sure to stay away from the roundabouts.
Can you hear me now? Got to get a smaller bike or a better phone provider.
Can you call me later, Daisy?
No, son, I am not 'almost there yet'
Heads up. That dachsund who always chases us is on the right.
Please stop texting me!
I can't talk long, I'm roaming.
Speak up, you sound a little distant.
Unlimited wireless minutes in a billing cycle
She's gaining on me!
I want to start biking with other people
It was either this or couple's therapy.
What do you mean you've never turned before.
I think the linguine is long enough now.
The curve up ahead is gonna be hell
Just because we live in the same city now, doesn't mean we have to give up on our long distance relationship.
This memes not trending? We look like morons for no reason?
I'm stopping for lunch-- I'll order for you!
This is why we have so many roaming charges.
If this thing were any longer I'd have to dial 1 to call ya.
You said you needed space.
Daisy, I can't afford a stretch limo, but will you go to the Prom with me?
I've had enough of your backseat driving.
I'm sorry, Karen, but long-distance just isn't working anymore.
Yes it's a little more clear but with the soup cans and string we had unlimited calls.
I know I'm wasting our minutes dad, but obviously my yelling "wait up" isn't getting me anywhere.
No, I didn't just fart!
Just calling to say "hi" and could you pedal a little slower?
Yes I'll accept the charge.
Are you far behind?
I'm going ahead, you can catch-up.
How would you feel about tackling a railroad crossing?
I need warp speed in 3-2-1...
Curve!
Tell McKinsey the proposal is fine, push back my meeting with marketing, and for God's sake pedal harder.
I had no idea this is where you were going with your ‘healthy long distance relationship’ idea!
Back off, you're following too close.
You're the one who's been acting distant.
I can't hear a thing. Let me text you.
Want to stop at the bar up ahead? There are, like, 30 other spandex-clad bikers there and the plan is to take up all of the seating, barely drink anything, but still somehow manage to be super fucking annoying and disruptive.
Daisy, Daisy, text me your answer, do. Don't let Trump politics keep me so far from you.
I'm sorry, we're breaking up.
We'll be there in about an hour, and in an hour and four seconds.
Yes, I did have Beans for lunch.
I'll ask one last time: would you please stop riding my tail?
It's your breath.
Are we almost there?
I'll race you home!
C'mon, you have to pee again?
You're overreacting. This is just a trail separation.
I told you a bicycle for two was a stretch.
Isn't it kind of sexist for me to be riding in front?
Stupidest. Court. Order. Ever.
Where are the children?
Turn right at 3 o’clock my time.
The "just-friends" bike.
Are you close?
I'm worried we're drifting apart.
We need to talk about this separation thing again.
Of course it's going to bring us closer together again. Just keep pedaling!
I wonder what Einstein would have to say about this?
Pebble coming up in 20 feet.
I think you wanting more space is getting out of hand.
This still feels long distance to me.
John, just ask for directions already!
Ready for a sharp turn to the right?
Can you wait for few seconds? I hit a red light here.
Would you stop calling your using up all my long distance minutes
I'll call you when I get home.
But your profile said you like long bike rides.
I want a divorce. This separation just isn't working out.
I would like to patent a bicycle built for two distant cousins.
Where are you?
This trial separation isn't working.
I'm losing you. I think it's a bad connection.
I'd like to extend our trial separation.
We're moving forward with our separation agreement.
I already told you why... I can't afford a carriage and I have space issues.
" This was the compromise, the divorce lawyer said we had to share the bike''
Is there much traffic up ahead?
Meet me at the corner.
And remember, we can turn only left with this thing.
What's taking you so long?
Biking's great, Jerry, but I still think we need to see a marriage counselor!
I'll meet you at the Starbucks up ahead. What time will you be there?
What do you mean 'slow down' so you can catch up?
I think I just passed the event horizon.
Dead skunk coming your way...
I'm worried that this long distance relationship is starting to affect where we are going.
Wow, you've never said I'm right before. Oh, turn right? OK.
Please, let's not drag this out.
Honey, remember, this bike makes wide turns.
Next time you ride downwind.
I can't believe you are breaking up with me by phone.
Let's speed up and get out of here! I just crossed the red light...
I want to warn you I had Mexican for lunch.
Maybe it's time we head our separate ways.
Honey, would you let me know when we've crossed the event horizon!
C'mon! You jerkin' my chain again?
I said turn right
Seriously, we're divorced now; I think we should get our own bikes.
Stop following me; it's over.
Be more careful on this next corner
It may have been red for you but it was green for me.
I did say it's all downhill from here. Give it a minute.
I'll give you a call back after I reach the finish line
We’re still in tandem—why do we need to talk about our relationship?
This is not what I had in mind when I said get a stretch limo.
This is not what I meant by a long distance relationship.
Call me if you get a flat tire.
You're really going to have to start peddling back there.
Yeah hi, it's your wife again. Perhaps you could do a better at judging this next railroad crossing.
I feel closer to you already.
Looks like we're going to finish first and fourth.
I thought this was supposed to bring us closer together.
Just shout, On your left, there's no reason to call !
I got the bike shorts on sale yesterday. Why?
I can barely hear you, I'll text you when we get home.
I think we should see other people
Hey, can you slow down a bit? You're getting too far ahead of me.
Yeah, we could try long walks on the beach and be just like everyone else
No more backseat driving, okay?
Just your normal long bike ride.
It's OK. My wife can't hear us. OK. My husband can't hear us.
We make a left in 100 feet.
Right now we're third and eighth.
Look I can't be at my collaborative best stuck in a workspace that's just a metaphor for absolute authority.
How's the traffic back there?
"No really, let's keep in touch".
I think the lawyer was right, we should have split the bike in the divorce.
You've been avoiding me lately, I can tell.
Can you pick up the pace a little bit?
You're breaking up
Okay, now let's try it with the giant pane of glass.
Race you to the finish line.
You're the one who wanted to separate.
Do you think I'm clingy?
We don't look "in love". We look foolish.
Even so, I want to thank you for remembering I wanted a long bike ride for my birthday.
I will call you when I get there.
Didn't I tell you that doing activities together would bring us closer.
Really? I thought you were ahead of me.
When you said a stretch limo...
I'm just not sure I'm ready for long distance.
?Does this mean we're in a long distance relationship??
sharp left coming up , could be a problem
Seriously? You called me collect?
Engage
But no, a boy bike wasn't enough for you, so you had to go and get a biiig-boy bike.
...Oh. Problems with the space-time continuum? Hang on a sec...
Siri, call rear admiral.
This wasn't what I had in mind when you told me you ordered a stretch
How could your GPS reading be different from mine?
Hey, it wasn't me that ran the red light!
Cole slaw and baked beans. Why?
Yeah, we can look really smug when we arrive, but it's the last time I ask for an "eco-friendly stretch."
You said size didn't matter
I think the trial separation is going well.
Let's get down and see if we can figure out how to turn this damn thing around.
Why do we always have to take the long way?
What do you mean I'm still getting my sweat on you?
This time no turns, okay?
Hey, can I call you back in five? I think we're plummeting to our deaths right now.
Is this enough of your own space?
You're breaking up. Can you pedal harder?
There's a bug on my neck?
Don't worry, son, ma's got your back.
I should have turned left WHERE?
You are back-seat steering again, dear.
Are you still with me?
You've just been so distant lately.
I'm not sure about this whole long distance thing.
What do you mean by a turning radius?
Ya, I'm trying to give her more space now.
Sit tight, I am going to turn around.
It's great spending more time together.
What time is it where you are now?
Lean left on 3!
Sometimes I feel like I do all the work
Did you remember to attach the "Caution Wide Right Turns" sign?
But should I turn left when I get there, or when you get there?
When you said "we'll take a stretch" I thought you meant a limousine.
Hey babe, can you hurry up?
It becomes normal length when we get to 99.999999% of the speed of light.
Whose turn is it?
But I thought riding a tandem bike would bring us closer together.
Pothole in 10, 9, 8..."
Haven't heard we are attached at the hip yet, have you?
Bump ahead!
When we get closer to the singularity, our data minutes become infinite
Damn... I left my water bottle at the house." "I see it on the counter. I'll grab it." "Can you make sure we set the alarm while you're there?" "Sure thing. How's traffic?
I'll be home when you get there tonight honey.
You're having an affair aren't you?
Roger that, rollerblader at 9 o'clock
Our therapist was right, this time apart is really good for us.
Synchronize activity trackers. We're entering Queens.
I've got the sense you've become more distant.
But what if we don’t have six kids?
I'm changing lanes!
When Doc said share a hobby, I think she meant in the same time zone.
Yes dad, I can feel the bonding.
I feel we should steer the conversation in a different direction.
Well, it's not quite the romp I had envisioned when she said "trial separation."
No, I don't need to ask for directions.
I think this separation is going to work.
There's a spider on your back.
Hon, Google says: "Recalculating"
When we get there you order, I'll pay.
I'm not being a back seat driver, it's just my turn to drive.
Restroom break in 5 more bike lenghts !
So now you're willing to talk about the distance between us?
But you said you needed space.
Your butt crack is showing.
... but you said you wanted more space in our relationship!
We're OK. The restraining order simply said '...not within 12 feet...' of one another.
Just tandem calling. Can you hear me now?
I am not sure this is what the marriage counsellor meant by spending time together.
Are you following me?
I'm sorry, but I just don't know if I can do a long-distance thing any more.
You do realize this is another long distance charge?
If it starts to rain, I'll call you back.
Let me know when you start to feel the rain.
Follow me.
Hello Please....slow...down
Never again will I ride with a dachshund owner.
I know you said you wanted to see less of me, so does this work?
I want a divorce.
I can still smell you.
Must you always follow me?
You know you're difficult during your cycle...
Catch Up.
Not clear at all. I'm going to have to change my provider.
I feel like we need couples therapy.
Upon closer review I've come to the brilliant conclusion that this bike is not a hot idea
Whaddya mean I'm losing you?
We should be there in about two minutes and two minutes and two seconds respectively.
How about we end this seperation?
No, Gerald, I think your fear of intimacy is clearly the issue in our relationship.
For breakfast? Eggs and beans...Why?
Where have you been?
I feel like we're moving apart.
Bicycle built for a family plan
We've agreed to a trial separation.
are you pedaling...I don't hear you pedaling
You don't think this is taking a trial separation too far?
Quit complaining! I told you it was going to be a long bike ride.
Next time, we skip the free upgrade.
Nope - I can still hear your damn humming.
Not much, you?
No, you can't wear the yellow jersey.
You really think we've grown apart?
Sharp curve ahead!
Do you want me to stop and pick up something?
Just wanted to be sure you haven't fallen off!
Can you smell me now?
Gladus! We're coming to a hairpin!
I'm pretty sure I'm being followed.
How are we growing apart?
My therapist says this trial separation isn't working.
The separation agreement says we switch at Battery Park.
I'm not sure this elastic bicycle invention will catch on.
My wife and I just separated.
We're experimenting with a trial separation.
This distance biking is really bringing us together.
Oh you're crazy... That light was green.
Did we just pass through a wormhole?
Try taking your foot off the brake.
Pull over, I have to pee
When you get to the picnic, tell them I'm right behind you.
Watch out for traffic at the next turn!
The Wi-Fi on this bike is terrible.
Marvin, this is NOT a stretch limo
Understood, I'll be a little more cautious at the railroad crossing.
Say no more, I'm way ahead of you.
Honey, can you please ask for directions?
Make it quick,I hate getting hit with roaming charges.
I think the seperation is working.
Just admit you want a divorce.
I think I need to stop in a minute...you should stop in two.
How does my ass look from back there?
Our therapist is right, cycling has brought us so much closer.
Sorry. At first, you didn't sound like Daisy.
I think I misunderstood when you said "Long bicycle ride."
So how's the weather?
I'll order the macchiatos, you pick them up.
Maybe we should start seeing other people.
You were right: it is possible to keep our training schedule without violating the restraining order.
I'll text you at the red light!
I SAID I want a divorce.
Are you still going uphill?
I think I need to read the descriptions more carefully on Amazon.
I told you UberBike wouldn't catch on.
Winter is coming.
Damn...I though spending time together would bring us closer.
I'm NOT trying to outpace you.
So far, so good, Mr. Armstrong. Tour de France officials suspect nothing.
I'm calling to give you a heads up that I just farted.
We need an intercom system so we can cut done on our data usage.
On your left.
This is not what I meant by a trial separation." (from my wife, Karen Schapiro); or from me: "I said to get a stretch LIMO.
Whoever gets home first should walk the dog.
Let's keep our distance for a while.
One, those screeching sounds are not convincing and two, I know we are not in a tunnel.
How can I convince you that this doesn't make us get there sooner?
The reception is terrible. I only have two long bars.
This is the shortest long-distance relationship I've ever heard of.
Thanx for giving me my space.
Watch out! We're nearing a turning point in our relationship.
This was great before we got these phones.
Why do you always have to be such a drag.
Pedal faster. I can't afford these roaming charges.
Okay, okay. Will you stop riding my tail?
Do you want to reconsider the restraining order?
No, you cannot steer. I am hanging up.
I think our therapy sessions are working!
Oh, the usual. You?
You're falling behind
Okay. We won't stop for Mexican next time.
Maybe cutting out the middleman wasn't such a great idea...
Are we there yet?
This puts "cycling" in perspective.
I can just make the light
Did you not just say 'Don't push it?'
What do you mean, there are no breaks at your end either?
No worries, I'll be there in a minute.
"What time is it where you are?
Hang on, I think we can make it across the tracks.
I'm steering us to the attorney. This trial separation isn't working out.
Are you still pedaling back there?
Peddling Miss Daisy.
I'm talking to the female part of me.
Are we there yet?
No more time zone jokes, please!
I am on my bike, I'll call you later
We aren't getting any closer.
You called to say my T-shirt is inside out?!
Who are you and why are you following me?
Hold your breath real quick.
Yes, I know the saying about allowing spaces in a relationship, but this is ridiculous!
I think you went through a red light.
Daryl, this is not what I meant when I said I needed space.
Stop following me.
Just left a dead cell zone, you'll be hitting it shortly
Get ready for a sharp right.
If we're on the same path, why don't I feel closer to you?
"When you get there order me a skinny latte".
...and tragically, Bob thought he could cross the tracks ahead of the train.
I don't know what scares me more: the right turn ahead or swinging into oncoming traffic to make it.
We need to do even more stretching.
Corner ahead.
Turn coming. Prepare to lean in.
Wanna ditch the friggin' extension? Then stop eating beans!
Agreed, no more soy cheese burritos
Do you lean to the left or to the right
Can you hear me?
Don't worry, I got us a great long distance calling plan.
No need to shout.
It's a hoax: distance doesn't makes the heart grow fonder.
I can still ride your ass from back here
If you need me to pedel harder, just text me!
Hello? You again? What are you peddling this time?!
I still miss the Hummer.
We're doing a trail separation
If you get there first, order me a latte and try for a spot by the window.
Hang in there, we're in the last stretch.
O.K.! I promise to stop eating black bean burritos the night before our rides.
When I get home I'll walk the dog. When you get home you can start dinner.
Couples Therapy? Seriously? I think that's a stretch.
I know we can beat the train to the crossing, if you pick up the pace.
Your what? Separation anxiety?
The light's about to turn red, but I think I can just make it.
Let me know when you get into town and I'll pick you up.
Look, we're heading in the same direction. I just need a little space right now.
I still can't afford that carriage, Daisy.
Hang an alt-right?
I'm making record time. How about you?
How's it goin back there?
Hope you make the green light!
It has 18 speeds and it is restraining-order compliant.
And then Todd realized the call wasn't coming from inside the house.
Why would they say we look like a dachshund?
Yeah, I heard you and I do remember promising to love, honor and obey, but I can only pedal so fast.
You're the one who needed more space.
Return to the limo, then, Madam?
You know I hate it when you call me at work.
You may want to hold your breath in a couple of seconds.
I thought biking would bring us closer together.
I think we should see other people
It just feels like we're struggling to really turn a corner as a couple.
This long distance relationship does suck.
No backseat driving.
If you recall, we're trying to reduce our workout conversations.
You told me you wanted a closer relationship!!!
For our next tandem let's get the Bluetooth
Don't you think this trial separation is getting out of hand?
Are you still mad about my leaving the toilet seat up?
Give me a brake.
Wasn't this supposed to bring us closer together?
I guess this means we are still taking a break?
What do you mean you don't feel like we're connected anymore?
I don't think I'm ready for a long-distance relationship.
But I told you, it's just a trial separation.
Get ready, wormhole ahead.
You wanted the trial separation, not me!
If I get there before you do, I'll save you a seat.
I just don't think it's far enough to fool our spouses.
Who is this?
Can you stoke me now?
Long distance charges may apply.
But our therapist said activities were supposed to bring us closer together.
I will text you when we get there.
Yes, i can hear you now.
I am on my bike, I'll call you later
I feel that you always keep me at a distance.
We're in the home stretch.
Sharp left coming up.
Are we drifting apart?
Say again? You sound so distant.
Could you pedal a little faster, dear? It's bdginn Could you pedal a little faster, dear? It's raining back here.
I'll start supper since I will be home first.
No, it's not a cool way to go to the prom.
I should be home by 7:00. What about you?
I think you left the hand brake on.
Mary...I'm just not sure we can make long distance work
I told you no garlic and onions before a ride!
Okay, okay... I'll pull over and wait up for you.
Not ready yet for having a long-distance relationship, honey.
Watch this wheelie!
Seperated or not, a decision on left or right would be in both our interests.
Only 0.2 miles to the Divorce Court...
You're never going to catch up at this rate.
Let me know when you cross the state line.
Don't blame me. I didn't run that red light. You did.
Yeah, I'm with her now. We wanted a couples activity, but we also needed some alone time.
Hurdler's at 2 o'clock!
Hang in there, almost done with the long stretch.
Rock.
It was the only way we could compete in the tandem race and stay in compliance with the restraining order.
This wasn't exactly what I meant when I said I needed some space.
Finally, some quality time together.
Just because we have this arrangement doesn't mean I can't fart.
Who farted?
I need you to bring up the rear
We're on full elastic stretch. Get ready for the backspring.
You wanted to share my hobby and you're still not satisfied!
Stop stalking me baby, it's over.
I'm headed home. Where are you headed?
I'm running late. Can you pick up the kids?
In order to complete your call, you must first dial '1' and the area code.
It's good to stay connected.
This is not what I meant when I said that I needed more space.
' Does Beano make a regular bike?
Stop following me.
No, I don't have any brakes up here.
Honey, when I said some time apart would do us both good, this is not what I had in mind.
This ride is much longer than I thought it would be.
Engine Room, shifting to low on my count.
This is not exactly what I meant by a 'trial separation.'
Yes dad, but the generation gap is growing.
Been there...done that.
We need to make it longer. I can still smell your farts.
I hope this "distance makes the heart grow fonder" thing works!
I'll have to call you way back.
Think of me as your peloton.
I told you this wouldn't be a stylish marriage.
Want to meet up at the coffee shop on 130th?
Henry! Please pull up your shorts!
Does your divorce lawyer have any other cool ideas?
You can expect heavy rain clouds at mile marker 137.
This isn't exactly what I meant by "time apart."
I don't think I CAN make a right turn!
I'll order then you pay.
I can make this light but I doubt you will.
I told you this was better than marriage couseling.
Speed up if the light turns yellow.
I dunno, lately she's constantly on the phone and she's become so distant.
I don't even remember how we did it before.
I'm gonna be a bit late.
"Can You Hear me, now?" John Curliano, Alameda CA.
Give me your answer, do.
What state are you in?
Sorry, but if you keep stalking me, I'm calling the cops.
What happens when we come to the fork in the road?
Well this is a stretch
I just need a little distance
Left at the next corner.
Remind me whose therapist suggested that this would bring us closer together?
I don't call this a trial separation.
I'm taking a left, you comin'?
Distance training will keep us together in the long run.
" We can place 1st and 5th if we step on it!
I thought I lost you on the last turn.
No, YOU'RE the back-seat driver!!
It looks like you're going to finish second again.
Please stop sending me chain letters
This long distance relationship isn't working out for me.
'On three...backpedal!'
I'm glad you're enjoying our limo service's Bike-To-Work day, ma'am.
Have you been seeing people behind my back?
You really don't think the kids will notice something's up?
The bike store said this would give us room for a growing family
Don't you think that having our own space is helping our relationship?
I can't help it- You[re the cook.
Daisy,Daisy
We decided not to get divorced for the kids.... but there were a few concessions.
When do you think we can meet up?
U-turn ahead. Suggestions?
Comin' up on Lombard, sweetheart...
That was then. This is now.
Next time can we get a stretch limo?
If we hit heavy traffic, you're on your own.
So what if you went through a red light? I didn't.
Agreed. No more beans for breakfast.
On your left.
I told you long distance relationships never work.
I need more space.
This long distance relationship is a little too much for me to handle.
This is ridiculous; we've got unlimited free minutes, but we've got to get hands-free earbuds.
You realize, Ma, you're taking helicopter parenting to a whole new level.
Hello.... Yes, I'll follow you.
There's a right turn coming up. If it doesn't work out, I loved you!
Change in plans, no turns.
Will you pick us up a bottle of wine on your way home?
I'll call you when we get there.
I'll have to call you back, someone is following me.
I'm gonna be there before you. What do ya wanna eat?
Do you think our trial separation has lasted long enough?
When you get there, order me a beer.
Did you lock the door?
What? You're breaking up!
I'm calling to discuss what our counselor said about engineering artificial distance in our marriage.
Our therapist said a tandem bike! This IS a tandem bike!!
You were right. They do only have Prime Day to get rid of the weird stuff.
I'll save a table for us.
Honestly, I took "a ride in the park" to be slightly more...I don't know....romantic.
It's about those bean burritos you ate last night.
Yes dear, I can still hear you now.
This isn't what I had in mind when I said to pick a hobby that challenges our communication skills.
Are you still pedaling?
Not exactly the nice, long bike ride I had in mind.
This long distance relationship is working out.
Heads up, we're gonna turn left at the next intersection.
Can you pick up the pace? I'm falling behind and you are out of it all together.
What do you mean this isn't equitable, Susan?
Be there soon, I'm a few minutes behind you
Sorry, you're breaking up.
We will do lunch when you catch up.
It's okay. This is just a trial separation.
Uh, do you have any brakes back there?
How's it goin back there?
What did you think "long distance ride" meant?
Hey, Honey...could you stop following me?
You really bungee cord was the way to go?
How long have you been following me?
I can't stop following you.
Yeah, YOU'LL be on time for work, but I'LL be late again.
I thought a day riding tandem would bring us closer together.
Pete and Sylvia discuss the upcoming tight corner using the same techniques that they learned in couples thepay
In about 5 minutes, check out the robin on the right.
#chainsthatbind
Speed up. You're falling behind.
A bear chasing us? Don't worry about it.
A wheelie? Hey, you know I'm up in the air with that.
Which do you hate more, the current news cycle or this?
So long, we have a weak connection
I didn't miss the stop. I can't figure out how.
If we end the separation can we get a shorter bike?
I feel like I'm always chasing you.
You should have went before the left the house.
What's the problem? I thought you agreed to a separation.
I think someone's following me.
Are you sure roaming charges will apply?
I thought you said you enjoyed long bike rides.
Don't be such a back seat driver.
My entry is no caption at all. No words can improve this. It stands alone.
No. I don't think they make a girl's model.
Oh-oh. Rotary ahead.
This isn't what the counselor meant by, "a long bike ride together."
I only have one bar, too.
Brake honey.
Not now Mom!
Our relationship? Well right now I'm feeling very distant from you.
Honey, do you have the water bottle?
This was brilliant! We should cross the finish line two bicycle lengths ahead of everyone else!
This bike was a great idea. But, you got any ideas about the sharp curve ahead?
No, I would come in first and you'd take second.
Hey, can you pedal a little faster?
This isn't the kind of long distance romance I had in mind.
This isn't what I meant when I said I needed a little space.
This long distance relationship is working out.
Step on it. You're breaking up!
I don't care if it's natural, Gary. You're going back to regular deodorant.
You promise you're pedaling?
They said the frame should be "vertically stiff yet laterally compliant".
I'm finally getting the space I need in our relationship.
I have to get back for my shift at the limo service.
I'd like to apologize in advance...
It gets better
We decided to give each other space.
The loneliness of the long distance two-seater-biker.
Bicycling as exercise is kind of a stretch.
Dude? We got a stretch!
Not what I meant by long-distance bike rides.
"Hi, can you slow down"?
Good news and bad news. I'm first and you're last.
It's the parking that's tough!
This isn't what I had in mind when you asked for a trial separation agreement.
You reached Tour de Emotional and Physical Detachment. Please speak after the never.
You will soon be entering the Eastern Time Zone.
No dear, I AM pedaling as fast as you are
We must be half way across the state by now. Why on earth did we buy a bike that can't make turns?
So, in 500 feet, I turn left, and you turn right.
So should I put my relationship status as 'it's complicated'?
Hey I just crossed the timezone. Prepare to adjust your watch!
You still think this was a good idea?
Ted, before we left, did you remember to sign the will?
You're 87% of the way there and you're never catching up!
Your mother sent it.
Sorry, the cell service here is no good.
I think you pedaled into an "event horizon".
Don't talk and ride! It's very dangerous, kids.
Meet me at the bike shop at 10:15.
Nope. I can still smell the beans.
I hope this new arrangement will end your continual complaints about my flatulence.
Hold on, I'm going to switch ears.
I think we're taking this 'conscious uncoupling' too far.
Yes, it's true. We finally separated.
You're the one with an intimacy issue.
I still want a divorce.
Is it windy where you are?
Ha, Ha, you"ll never catch me!
Are you sure you're peddling your own weight?
Would you rather FaceTime?
Exactly hun, I thought I'd miss tennis too. But I've haven't felt this close to you in ages.
Harald, for the next drop call in the valley, try Morse code.
Do you mean this left or the next left?
Jim, are you there?! I think I am losing you!
Ease up on your brakes, will ya?
"What time is it where you are?
How long have you been driving for Uber here in Shanghai?
Babe, the therapist said, " Do something you enjoy together, get some alone time, and compromise."
I said, 'I love recreating together, don't you?' Over.
Okay, I've done the math, and a wheelie is out of the question
Honey, I don't think this is bringing us any closer
You've just been so distant lately.
I'm still not dropping the restraining order.
I think we're getting close.
Hurry up, you're falling behind.
That's right--straight ahead.
Not exactly what I meant when I said I think we need some space from each other in our relationship.
We'll be charged overage data for this cycle.
Remind me again. When can I expect you home for dinner?
I said turn right, dammit!
Don't pretend you know me, over and out.
Watch out! The drawbridge is coming up!
I'm not sure either. I'll give you a call when I get there.
This is not what I had in mind, when I said I wanted to take a long distance bike ride.
This long distance thing isn't working out for me.
I was thinking about our intimacy issues.
Phonewise, sound does not go backward
I just feel like we have been drafting apart
No, you hang up first.
I told you cycling would bring us closer together.
I think we're drifting apart.
Fine. And you?
Obviously I will be home before you. Shall I start dinner?
You would think there would be a cell tower at one end or the other
Honey, since you'll get home before me can you be sure to let the dog out?
It's not the length of the bike. It's the length of our phone conversations that's ruining our relationship
Call me before you turn.
Yea right,I don't believe that by a long stretch.
Is it this important to you that we be in different time zones?
I like these long bike rides
Togetherness or just connected?
It's a long strech
I'm way ahead of you. The Kushners are out.
I think it's good that we're finally spending some time apart.
I should have supper on the table by the time you get home.
Honey, you've become a real drag.
This wasn't what I meant when I said I needed space.
We just needed some space.
STEER ME! ... Can you STEER me now?!
It's not you, I just need some space.
Leave the kids out of this.
I hate how we're growing apart.
I want a separation. Well, more separation.
Brace for a bump in 5...4...3...
We should get there by noon.” “Your time zone, or mine?
Frankly, I'm getting a little tired of this long-distance relationship.
So what size family should we have?
The lawyer said separated means separated.
Pull over! Your spandex is riding up!
Okay, Betty, get ready for the next turn.
The trainer said to stretch more before riding, but this is ridiculous.
It is hard to hear you. Please text me instead.
Take off the brake.
Are you sure this is an Olympic event?
Home stretch!
I enjoy these father-son talks.
Well, they did say we could cover more ground with this bike.
And then she said, 'Where are you going to park it?'
We are trying long distance
Sorry, but you are finishing third.
Don't worry. When it comes to stretch limos they get what they pay for.
I'll be there in 5 minutes. You'll be there in 10.
Give me your answer do. Have we grown apart?
This may not be the best time to tell you but.....
Well, this is a fine time to tell me there's a funny noise coming from the chain.
This bike is for couples who are staying together because of the children.
Have your chiropractor call my chiropractor.
I only have one bar!
This isn't what I had in mind when I said I think we should spend some time apart.
Where do we park this thing?
No, I didn't call you, I was checking voice mail at work.
I'm having second thoughts about our long-distance relationship.
Hello, which way are we turning?
Melissa, Don't worry.....you'll get equal pay someday, ..as soon as you catch up to me.
I feel like I'm pulling your weight.
Can you hear me now? Good, because I wanted to tell you that I think the lifecycle of this relationship has finally exceeded its limit.
We've agreed to a trial separation.
Honey, you can bike but you can't hide.
Is everything okay? You've been so distant.
Right now it's just a trial separation.
I just don't know if I'm cut out for a long-distance relationship. Over.
... don't forget everything is returnable within 30 days.
It's great spending quality time together
You ready? Sharp left ahead!
are you having trouble keeping up with me?
What's your area code again?
Just sign the divorce papers! Maintaining this distance is too complicated.
You've been awfully distant lately.
This trial separation is taking too long!
O.K. O.K. I'll turn right and you turn left.
So what's your answer, Daisy?
On my way.
I'm not sure this qualifies as 'separation'.
Doctor, I'm getting that feeling of being followed again.
Any idea how we turn?
Our psychiatrist recommended that we spend time apart..........
I told you not to call me from up front. You know how expensive long-distance charges are!
You're breaking up--I must be in a dead zone.
Try not to make any more turns.
Ground Control, I'm through the black hole...didn't feel a thing, but it's bleached my T-shirt.
Black hole ahead.
I feel like you've become distant.
Yeah, we could switch, but it is buggier up here.
Can we please talk about our separation?
Modern Togetherness
Honey, I can see your butt crack.
This is not bringing us closer.
I feel like the trial separation is going really well.
Honey, we should try stretching the bed as well!
Are you sure you need this much personal space?
no way you can go your way.
Their therapist told them to give each other space.
For the couple that has grown apart.
I don't care if it did turn yellow -- keep pedaling!
Fine ... but no anchovies!
That wasn't me,really. It must have been something we rode by.
We should have plunked instead for the stretch-limo.
Oh, c'mon, my farts aren't THAT bad.
What about last night/s dinner beans?
I told you to call me when you get there!
The therapist said that this should be part of our trial separation.
This long distance telecommuting has really effected my phone bill
Next time you make me run a red light, I'm popping a wheelie.
We need to talk. I don’t think we can turn this relationship around.
I would love to stop there but is there parking for a vehicle this size?
first time on a bicycle limo ?
I agree, banning texting while riding was a good idea.
Is this trial separation working for you?
Tell me when the light is green and you can go.
Was it something I said?
I told you that long distance relationships are hard!
Of course I checked the app first!
This new family plan is a real stretch.
I want a divorce.
Lets not try to cross that railroad track.
Introducing the I Can't Stand Em' Tandem™
Will you shut up, it's better then walking!
Make this call short dear, its long distance.
This restraining order is severely hindering our fitness regimen...
Driver, the mini-bar needs to be refreshed.
So, how are the kids?
When I asked for a separation, this isn't what I had in mind.
I just feel like we're growing apart sometimes.
I'll stear, you Google brake failure!
Tell me again, how do we go around corners?
What do you mean you "want to see other people"?
I'd love to switch, Alice, if I thought you had the smarts.
Why do you keep veering to the right?
Honey, could you pick up some milk on the way home?
It happens as you approach light speed.
Hold on, the guy behind me is yelling about something.
I thought biking would bring us closer.
It's sunny up here; how about you?
I can't hear you. I think I'm in a bad reception zone.
Welcome to hook and ladder school.
Did you say TRAIN!!!
What's the problem? Wind breaking is what the person in front does.
Can't you just text me?
Stop rushing me, Linda. I'm already ahead of you.
I think we overdid it with the stretching.
Do you think we'll incur roaming charges?
To my chagrin, the time had not yet come for the eco-friendly limo.
Bad connection. I'm losing you.
When they said long-distance biking, I don't think this is what they meant.
We forgot about the "S-Turns" coming up.
I feel like we are getting further and further apart
Where do you want to stop for lunch?
When do you think you'll get here?
I'm sorry, but renting a stretch limousine was way too expensive.
Want to meet at the pub in say, twenty seconds?
I'm so glad you can't smell me.
Marcia, I've made a decision. No more beans.
Love this bicycle built for divorce.
Hey son, how's the weather back there?
How much longer do you think?
I win.
Is this what our therapist meant when she spoke of separation anxiety?
Sorry, but I'm not in this for the long haul.
My left or your left?
We are no longer in tandem, I want a unicycle.
Did you say 'trial separation'?
I'm developing separation anxiety.
I don't know if it's me but lately, you've seem so distant!
I'm having second thoughts about our new flagpole delivery service.
Do they see us? Ours is bigger. Right? Are they looking? Let's go around again.
Looks like Einstein was right.
Next time order a bike with chain drive to the wheels.
I just feel like we're not as close as we used to be . . .
Faster son! Our trainer said we shouldn't overstretch.
Because I'm a Type A personality and you're a Type B. that's why.
And I'll be making a left turn in about zero three seconds.
Is it a right or left turn up here on Albuquerque?
Honey, wait up!
Just stay far behind me they don't know we're together.
We've just grown apart.
What do you mean you're not in my time zone?
You're the one who served the garlicky refried beans, and kale filled burritos grandes.
Are you sure we're doing this right?
Don't worry--I'll be sure to text you before the next turn.
I used rubber glue to assemble the frame.
Biking was meant to bring us closer together
I told you there should be some distance in our togetherness.
8th and 42nd coming up. Um, we might have a problem here...
Just think of it as a stretch limo, honey.
Catch up will you!
Honey, did you remember to load the remarkably long water bottle into the remarkably long water bottle holder?
I sense something has come between us.
How's the weather back there?
I warned you I had issues with intimacy.
I feel as if something is keeping us apart.
The restraining order really makes this awkward.
Just confirming that we agree: this doesn't need a caption to be funny, right?
Can you pick up the pace, you're holding up the rear!
No, No, No I said We are breaking up.
Speed Bump ahead, 10 seconds......for you, 12 seconds.
You should pick up a tail wind on the next hill.
I think we've grown apart.
You forgot what? No, we can not turn around.
You sure you want to be in this for the long haul?
So don't freak out, but it looks like there's a left turn up ahead.
I think you may have misinterpreted 'trial separation'.
I'll call when I get home.
What do you mean you don't want to stretch this trip any farther.
It's just not the same between us when the kids are away.
Yeah I'm doing beta testing for this Citibike rideshare thing
I checked my cellphone bill before I left and I am over my allowable long distance roaming minutes. I'm going to say good bye now.
The random tandem demands them to pedal the metal but the puddle with the mud'll end them.
The therapist said this is a trial separation, but that we're taking baby steps.
Did you bring a charger?
Right turn coming up.
I just think marriage counseling was a lot physically safer
Why so far?
It looks like you'll get home before me, so you start dinner.
You do realize this call is long distance.
Isn't this better than a trial separation!
I said, slow down on those sharp corners!
But you said you needed some space in our relationship !
What do you mean? Where are the kids?
I miss you.
"Riding mountain switchbacks invalidates the warranty".
No, I'm not home yet.
That's "Hazard's Hairpin" just up ahead.
Would you get off the brakes.
I will be first at home, did you want me to preheat the oven?
This wasn't what I meant when I said we needed more space in our relationship.
Call me back when you are in my time zone.
Tour de Farts
How do you take a turn on this thing?
I am almost home. Would you like me to make dinner while I wait for you?
You missed the turn!
Spoiler Alert! Hard right turn coming up!
Talk louder - I'm losing you.
But this IS the Beanophile Deluxe!
Bump.
Isn't it great to be doing something together?
I am going to turn right, let's see if that brings us any closer.
Honey, did you just run a red light?
I don't see this relationship going anywhere.
I don't think this trial separation is working out.
Don't phone just text!
Are we reconciled yet?
We never do anything together.
OK I admit it. This isn't bringing us closer together.
Don't keep me in suspense. Left or right?
This is a pretty extreme arrangement over a few baked beans
We just ran a red light back here.
We've got to find a new marriage counselor.
But you are the one who wanted this time trial separation.
You said you needed more space between us, but this is taking it too far.
You seem distant.
sharp left turn just ahead
The divorce was too expensive.
Are you speaking to me again yet?
Check the blind spots, I'm getting ready to turn left.
No matter how hard you're pedaling, I always seem to be ahead.
This isn't what I had in mind when I said I needed space.
Thanks for letting me know my butt still looks big.
I'm not sure I like long distance cycling.
get ready, tight corner ahead
Start thinking about the left turn coming up.
Your own bike? But I thought the whole point of this was to bring us closer together.
I think I'm being followed.
I'll be the backseat driver next time
2 minute warning - left turn!
I wonder what the Long Island is like.
This long distance relationship just isn't working for me anymore.
We find this a valuable training exercise for our new stretch-limo recruits.
In thirty seconds you will experience a bad bump.
No, you can't catch up to me by pedaling faster.
Say, Any idea how we are going to make a U turn?
We never seem to catch up!
This concludes your bike and technology tour of Silicon Valley.
Fuck you, Bitch
Are you still mad at me?
Hey it's me, I'm gonna stop up ahead and brew some coffee. I'll have a cup waiting for you when you arrive.
Hold on, sign says S curves ahead.
Queen of the Slipscreen
Get off your phone and start peddling
I have to pee again.
Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now?
Hello, can you hear me now? Honey, if you can hear me, I told the guy over the phone, ‘extended warrantee’.
I'm so glad we're able to spend quality time together like this.
I said, "S T R E T C H limo! Limo! Limo! Limo!
When you rented the bike, how many did they say it was built for?
I think I'm ready for the next step in our relationship.
I thought a "Stetch Tandem Bike" would come with more seating and a bar.
Personally, I prefer the stretch moped.
Do you think we are roaming?
What?
Why aren't we as close as we used to be?
You said this would make us feel closer.
When you get here, let's go get a beer
Yes dear, we still have a good connection.
If you don't hurry up we'll never finish this ride.
Yes, your ringtone irritates me too.
I'm running the yellow, but you may have to stop.
Race you home!
Is it my turn to draft yet?
Don't forget--we won't always be in the same time zone.
Back off!
Let me call you back. I'm heading into a tunnel.
You may think we've never been farther apart, but technically we've also never been closer.
Sharp left coming up. I'll text you the rest.
When you suggested a bicycle-built-for-two, I was picturing something more romantic.
I feel like we're drifting apart.
My wife and I bought this bike just before our divorce.
This isn't working for me, I think we should get a legal separation.
Pothole at one o'clock!
Text STOP before you brake.
We're going the long way.
We agreed last time, sweet, then savory. Donuts, then fries.
This bike sucks!
Do you have any idea how much this call is costing me?
Please signal for a left turn.
Imagine the long-distance charges.
I'm not liking this long distance relationship.
I think you missed my point when I suggested we take the long way home.
I'll be there in five minutes . You'll be there in six.
Sunny here, still raining back there?
Honey, I feel we've grown apart.
....or, I'm peddling 24% harder.
This is NOT helping my separation anxiety!
No, no...my lawyer expects a call from YOUR lawyer!
My right arm is killing me, too. I'll order headphones when we get home.
Dear, I knew you were thinking about a trial separation, but this is frankly ridiculous!
Daisy?
If you get there first, get a large with pepperoni and mushrooms.
Will you be needing me any more this evening, Miss Trump?
I'm so glad we get to spend this quality time together
Honey, if it's distance you want, I can stay at Jim's.
Remind me again why size matters.
Knew we should've taken those couple drifting classes...
You promised this would bring us closer together.
So much for drafting
How much longer?
I think it would be a great idea if you started peddling.
I'll order pizza and you can pick it up.
I'll text you when I get there.
Remember, you were the one who wanted the trial separation.
I really think Beano is a better idea.
Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do.
David, I thought by now we'd be closer to each other...
Honey, get the selfie stick out.
Hang on, I'm getting another call.
I'll call you later,I think someone is following me.
So we should get there within 5 minutes of each other.
Yup, I'm riding into the wind...You know why!
I told you not to spit out that gum
We both like to get out and enjoy some fresh air and excercise together!
Warp factor 7, Scotty.
Catch Up.
Right.....left.....right.....left
The only downside with this bike, it costs eight grand a month to store it, in the city.
Turning right in 5, 4, 3,...
We can't keep going in a straight line for much longer
Maybe we should consider a separation.
Faster! You're running behind.
I can't help but feel that we are drifting apart
I'll be home before you. Give me a call when you get in.
Darling, I'm so glad we finally solved our intimacy issue.
You better be peddling back there!.
Would you like me to start dinner when I get home?
Technically, I know, but it doesn't feel very tandem.
It's over. We're drifting apart.
Just letting' you know, we've got a corner coming up.
Cab to caboose: this chain's cruisin' toward a train.
How does the 2020 election look from there?
Hon, I've never felt closer to you than I do now.
No, Sarah, it's all about the journey, not the destination!
Don't worry--this still counts as legal separation.
Remind me again, why did we pick this bike?
I appreciate the effort, but when I said I needed a little more space, this isn't what I had in mind.
You said we needed some distance.
Honey, we're in this together!
See, it feels like I'm right next to you.
This long distance relationship isn't working out for me.
You go left, I go right and we got them!
Don't turn!
Just so you know, I can tell when you stop pedaling.
Have you got my back?
I just feel you and I are too far apart.
From my perspective, your new biker shorts make your ass look downright tiny.
No, they said you are a little behind.
We've grown apart.
I think we should break up.
We love exercise but aren't talking to each other.
I'm glad we found a way to put some distance between us.
You're a distracted cyclist!" "No, you're a distracted cyclist!
Carol always took Tom's attempts at a break-up too literally.
You're getting home first so you make dinner!
Hey, did you bring your selfie stick?
This is not the trial separation I had in mind.
Thanks goodness our provider got rid of those long distance fees.
I think stretching is a waste of time.
Okay...I'll call you when I get there.
How is the weather there?
You're starting to break up. I think I'm out of range.
Honey, do you like my extra long bike?" "Well, at least now you have ONE thing that is extra long.
OK, we're coming to the turn, so listen carefully...
I can't accept 'we are going through a bad cell' anymore as an excuse.
Well you said you wanted a little more distance in our relationship.
Well , told you it was going to be a long ride.
The election has really effected everything around us
Our tour's over--the road tees up ahead.
Has that fart made it down to you yet?
Our relationship isn't clicking on all gears.
It's called telecommuting. Supposedly, it's revolutionizing the workplace.
Long distance calls
TELECOMMUTING
We need to talk, this long distance relationship isn't working.
A bicycle built for two; one with intimacy issues.
What part of "I need some space" are you not getting?
Let me know when you get here.
Honey, I could really go for a foot long hot dog.
I'll be home first. What do you want for dinner?
Sure, it's green, but it won't pass for a limo at the club.
It's okay, she's at the other end of the bike.
Your back seat driving is really pissing me off.
I'm stopping for a bite up ahead. Would you like my leftovers?
I thought I could commit to this relationship, but I can't.
I'm right behind you trying to catch up
So much better than texting, right?
Hey, you're the one wanted to go on a long bike ride.
I smelled that.
Do we have to dial 1 before the area code?
Get off your cell phone and pedal to catch up!
I have broken wind, hang back
I have a feeling we're growing apart.
our therapist said we needed to give each other some space.
Daisy, text me your answer true.
Ever done u-turns on one of these things before?
I'll be there in a minute.
I know you do not want to talk to me, and, I do nor want to talk to you, but our parents, up on the porch, can still see us.
If we break up now, neither one of us is going anywhere. How about joint custody of this bike?
Next time the person in front has the GPS
This isn't what I meant by needing more space.
Yes, I'd say our divorce is amicable.
Please take your foot off the rear brake
You're an excellent chauffeur, but this is not exactly what I had in mind when you promised me a stretch limo.
There's something wrong with this connection.
I'll wait for you at the finish line.
Keep up!
This trial separation isn't working.
I know you didn't see any problem with that last train crossing, but THINK Bob THINK.
What do you mean make a right turn?
Watch the corners!

What's new?
I believe this relationship is becoming geographically undesireable
Is this supposed to bring us closer together?
Area code 917?.....This is 212....we take the next left.
Prom dress? I thought YOU brought it!
I really wanted a stretch limo!
Would you like to lead for awhile
This long distance biking is kind of fun.
I love these tandem bikes made specially for married couples.
I'm not sure this is what the counselor meant by giving each other more space.
Yeah, yeah, I promise...I won't run any yellow lights.
When I said I liked long bike rides...
Car back!
Your call dropped between towers.
Baby, you can't keep calling me here.
Our marriage counselor was right, we really need to distance ourselves
You sound as if you're 6.8 feet away.
We should have veered to our left in November?
All the ad said was built for two!
Abort! Abort! Hairpin bend ahead!
Seriously, some people take the marriage vows of "Until death do us part" in the literal sense!
I now realize how far apart we've grown
I'm starting to feel a distance between us.
Let's start the turn. I think we can finish before lunch.
Just stay the course.
Are you sure this is "Tandem"?
Right turn coming up.
Copy that. Turn ahead.
Your pants ripped.
You'll never be a big wheel in this organization if you keep pulling my chain.
I'm so looking forward to meeting you!
Yeah, this long-distance thing isn't working.
I don't care how long it is. This still violates the spirit of the restraining order.
If we stand here long enough, someone will pay us a toll.
Why don't you have both hands on the wheel?
This isn't what I meant by "long bike ride."
This sure beats the two cans on a string!
Meet me at the deli; we'll get some lunch.
Can you speak up? I think I'm losing you.
You gotta catch up before we get to this next turn
I'm telling you! It was a skunk!
I still say the training wheels were a better idea.
Honey, would you mind pedaling a bit faster?
You sure we're not going the long way?
Can you text me? The reception is terrible up here.
Only a bit farther ahead.
When I said I needed some space, this wasn't what I had in mind.
If you want me to turn, you have to give me a two block notice. Stopping takes three.
I wish you'd reconsider our separation.
This Hyper Stretch feature allows us to have our own space while staying connected.
Yellow light? Don't worry: I can beat it.
Well my GPS says to turn right up ahead
I hope this doesn't count as roaming
I think I need more space
As trial separations go, this is idiotic.
It's come to my attention that you're pedaling slower.
I need a brake.
Do you have to be so pushy about it?
I want a new marriage counselor .
What do you mean, keep-up?
Wait up!
Wait for me.
So. whatcha doin'?
I just wanted to call and let you know that I'm so glad biking is bringing us closer together as a family.
What's that? You think we lost the kids?
I want to trust you, but the distance between is making it difficult.
Hey! Are you still peddling back there?
Speed bump in five .. four ..
Dad, Mom's asking if it will fit in the garage?
By the way, where is the hook and ladder?
"Ya know you could just tweet upon the seat of a bicycle built for two." (This was submitted by Garret Virchick, Somerville, Mass. - husband of KBlanton, the actual mag. subscriber. )
Stop complaining - if you want to be up front, ride faster!
I'm almost here, where are you?" "I'll be there in 5 minutes." "Ok, hurry.
Hang in there.
I'm out of gas.
Yes, I'll get there ahead of you, but you've been riding in my wake.
Warn me before you shift gears!
Next time, we got a sidecar, OK?'
Let's meet for lunch. See you in five minutes.
In 100 feet, make a U-turn!
Can you hear me now? We need to strategize making the next turn.
For the last time, quit following me.
Just because it's a bicycle built for two doesn't mean I have to like it.
You're gonna have to punch in for me today or I'll be late!
It's a marital therapy bike, Barbara. No matter how hard you work you will only push me away.
I'm glad we don't have to pay roaming charges.
What's the weather like where you are?
Curve up ahead, over and out.
Elon Musk ideas that amazingly did not win federal grants
I'm almost there.
A divorce would be better than this separation.
I'm sorry, operator, I don't accept collect long-distance calla."
We have a right turn coming up.
Your butt crack is showing.
In all honesty, I don't know if this incurs roaming charges.
I'm making a left turn now - in about a block for you.
Wanna race?
This way, I maintain my peace bond.
Daisy, I told you--I can't afford a carriage.
I think your need for stretch goals is creating distance between us.
You're not shotgun. You don't get to navigate.
What do you mean, "On your left"?
Why are we taking the long way home?
Are you still back there, honey?
Your text? No, I didn't get it.
Brace ! Sharp curve ahead.
"Honey, I know this is a bit of a stretch, but don't worry, we'll get there.
When I said that I wanted a different type of relationship, this is not what I meant.
I can't talk right now, but I'll text you at the next rest stop.
Not in two miles. Now!
I have to go now. Your daughter is tweeting me.
Pedal harder and catch up!
We're OK on the straight-aways but the turns are hell.
I called to say 'Slow down!' You're pulling away from me.
I'll clarify via chain mail message.
Pedal faster.
Just wondering...does my butt look fat in this?
Negotiating that last turn had us passing for a drunken wiener dog.
Is everything okay? You seem distant.
Enough with the "It's a Long Way to Tipperary."
I couldn't make out your text.
How the kids doing/
Sorry, I don't take calls from peddlers.
What do you mean, you want me to pedal faster?
I said turn left.
Because I'm pedaling faster, so speed up.
I know I've got a flatulence problem but doesn't this seem extreme to you?
Don't forget, Joshua, when you turn right, swing wide.
Enjoy long bike rides in less than five minutes a day!
Left. Left. Left, right, left ...
Did you bring the chain oil?
I told you not to put on your brakes before I did!
On your 6 !
We're separating.
Have you started pedaling yet?
Is it just me or is there something wrong with our bike?
I get the feeling you're not pedaling
I needed some space.
Turn left at the next corner. There's a great bakery with lots of parking.
My ass feels like It's dragging.
I think the hipster limo could work!
I know we want to be green, but carpooling has gotten ridiculous.
Second cousins once removed.
I's this is the "togetherness activity" you were talking about?
I don't hate you, Diane. I've just moved on.
. If you want me to keep riding with you your going to stop at yellow lights .
...So you're saying the long tube between us is the 'full bar' in your ad?
This separation is going to make us snap!
You're breaking up. Let's try texting.
The rubber band bike is a success - now to try the brakes
I can still see that mole on your neck.
No beaches in Denmark.
On the count of 3 Stand!
I thought this would help us avoid the usual tensions.
the long distance charges are a stretch!
I know tandems are nicknamed "divorce machines," but this is just a long separation.
I'm sorry, Todd, but I need more space.
This isn't what I meant by "long bike ride."
Front person: Hey yo, how ya be? Back person: Wazzup yo! I be great back here. Pedal faster ma dude. Front person: Will do, gotta go bye bud. Back person: NOOO
We've got to work out this long distance thing.
Using a phone to call a loved one? That's a stretch.
Hang on. We're approaching the switchbacks.
We've become separated by a long chain of events
If we can't keep up with the Joneses now, we'll never be able to.
Did you bring the giant lock?
I thought you said this would bring us closer.
But our therapist said I should give her space.
Hope they still have some when you finally get there.
Well, the lawyer did say that dividing the assets is often the hardest part.
I was going to send you a message, but you hate chain mail.
Okay, okay, okay! No more yellow lights.
This is the last bit of advice I am taking from that marriage counselor!
This long distance relationship just isn't working out.
The light just turned yellow - I think we can make it.
Meet me in 10 minutes at the pizza parlor.
No, it was your idea to use elastic tubing.
We are firing that marriage counselor.
Yeah, but it came with these cell phones.
Honey, I'm calling to tell you that I need space.
All right now, close it up.
Remember No U - Turns
I just need some space.  I'll call you back as soon as I get there.
If we're in different time zones they take an average and we finish before the race started.
Turn right at the corner
"I think we lost the other four riders over the Continental Divide".......
You're already there? I just left the house.
You said you need some space in our relationship.
It's cute, George, but have you thought about how you are going to turn this thing.
Next time let me pedal from front. You may actually enjoy watching my rear end flex for two hours straight.
We need to work on our communication.
There's a real cute pair of Grizzly cubs in the road up ahead.
I would like to spend more time with you too
No, we are not getting closer ... I am getting closer.
Stupid restraining order!
How's my steering?
Sharp turn coming up. Any ideas?
Where are you going?
What time zone are you in?
This new Uber Bike Pool is certainly cheap but I didn't think they'd make us pedal.
Everyone loves our new tandem. I'll take flattery over flatulence any day.
Get ready for the u-turn ahead!
This long distance relationship isn't working...
Almost in reach, yet the distance never change.
Sorry, but its the only way we can justify being on our cellphones 24-7-365 AND when we're exercising!
You're doing great honey. No one will guess we're having an extramarital affair.
Don't make it a competition, I want us both to be successful.
But I told you from the start I prefer a long-distance relationship!
Let's say we end our trial separation at that sharp right turn ahead.
Glad we got the new long distance plan
Why can't you ever keep up?
Honey, this isn’t exactly what I meant when I said that we should go for a “long bike ride”.
I told you a long distance relationship wouldn't work.
We just need some time apart.
I'm worried. You're getting behind.
This is your captain speaking
Does this count as a long-distance call?
911 - I think I'm being stalked ...
In five miles, slow down, I need water.
Honey, you're back to doping?
Why'd we rent the Abelard & Heloise model?
Sorry, but I don't think our long-distance relationship is working out.
I know you need space, but we seem to be caught in some type of infinite loop!
Snow?, in the desert?
Text me when you get there.
What makes you think I have a problem with intimacy?
It's a marriage extender, hon.
It feels like we've been growing apart lately.
"No, you're Schmoopy.., now shut-up and pedal already"!
I do the steering !!
Do these bike shorts make my butt look big?
So about the upcoming corner...
Yah, it's the tandem bike marriage saver model.
No, dammit, I'm not a telemarketer.
Martha, you know just the right bike for us!
I'll be in Scotland a'fore ye.
I can't talk now. Shoot me a text.
Is that one of my thongs you're wearing?
When you said 'I'll rent a stretch for our anniversary' I thought you meant a limo.
We better hang up. My long distance rates have gone way up...
Can you pass the EPO back here?
If I stop passing gas could we go back to our old tandem?
This is too much of a stretch for me.
How many bars are you getting there?
Is this really what you meant when you said you wanted more space in our relationship?
Other people take their bikes on the train why not us?
Wait a minute, we are disconnected.
No worries, I have gone to great measures to ensure our conversations are completely private and confidential.
Sorry, did I wake you? I forgot how late it is back there.
Front seat driver
No, I can't see the road either!
Hold your breath, Honey, starting....now.
Yes, we've grown apart. But I'm just not ready to get back to the unicycling world again.
I don't care what Google Maps says. It's my bike and we're turning left.
put the phone down and pedal!
Tight turn ahead
Honey, can we just get me to the finish line.
Go ahead and order for me. I'll be a bit late.
Mind the gap
Everything is just... moving a little too fast for me.
You said you wouldn't touch me with a ten foot pole.
This trial separation is going too far.
Telling me how sweet I look doesn't cut it any more!
If you come to a fork in the road, follow Yogi's advice, and then pray.
I do want to save our marriage. But I'm not ready to drop the restraining order.
what? the light was yellow.
It won't be a stylish marriage.
This whole "shared interests" idea isn't working. I need some space.
This isn't quite what I meant when I said we needed some time apart.
Just a sec. I think I can make this yellow light.
The court issued a restraining order. I have to stay at least 10 feet away.
I can't keep up at this pace.
Distance created communication problems for Harry and Alice's already strained relationship.
Honey, it's not safe to ride and be on the phone.
Quit hitting the brakes, you idiot!
I like big bikes and I cannot lie...
Yes, I'm still compliant with the restraining order
No, we don't need the supersize hacksaw, the normal one will do fine.
If you just pedal faster you'll eventually catch up.
Lesson learned. Next time I'll suggest a short bike ride.
Henry, I need to take a potty break
My lawyer called and asked me to call you to call your lawyer and ask him to call my lawyer
Let's not cut corners.
Daisy, Daisy, text me your answer do.
No, no. Pedaling backwards applies the brake....
It feels like you're not taking the restraining order seriously.
Flooding up ahead; did you pack our stilettos?
They don't call it a divorce bike for nothing
I can't hear you. Tweet it.
Do me a favor and signal for a left turn.
Hello? Bicycle company? There's something wrong with our bikes.
Can I call you back?
It's a long road ahead, honey.
Are you dropping me?
You took our separation really seriously...
I can't handle this long distance relationship anymore.
Keep it up, babe. This is the final stretch.
Can you hear me now?
It's not a complete loss. I just got an idea for The New Yorker cartoon puzzle.
You're breaking up, next time just text me.
It's just a separation, trial basis of course.
Yep, as to the question, ‘who are the biggest dorks of them all’ – settled
Our relationship is no longer moving forward.
The next time you eat beans before we ride this thing, I'm taking the front seat.
If we reconcile after the trial separation, we get a 50% refund on the bike rental.
Oh, and Mom knitted you this.
Lord, I prefer snowflake design on my sweater
And this is just a suggestion.
My girlfriends said, "Activities should bring us closer together."
I'm thinking about getting a divorce
We're coming down to the home stretch.
You've been so distant lately.
You're leaving me?
Can you hear me now? Daisy, Daisy, Give me your answer, Do!
This is a Democrat on his free cell phone being pulled by a working Republican on the phone he paid for
I'll pick up the milk on the way home.
I'm not sure this long distance relationship will work
I expect you'll get a chilly reception. Here's a sweater.
It's just like our date nights
Yes I can hear you and no I don't think the bike is too long.
Hey! Just a heads-up, that the three bean chili that I had for lunch is starting to kick in.
I had imagined the ride in a stretch limo quite different.
Fine! I'll follow you."
Quit falling behind.
Pedal faster, we,re coming to a hairpin turn.
Forget it ! The tail doesn't wag the dog.
My therapist said this would bring us closer together.
Are you SURE you're pedaling?
Do you stop at RR crossings?
Can you close-it-up at bit? These across-oncoming-traffic turns are getting dangerous!
It takes two to tandem
Backseat, can you hear me?
What do you mean we have to stop at a bathroom
I said if you were falling behind to just text me
Tell the truth--does my butt still look big?
You said you wanted to go on a long ride today
Everything looks fine from here.
Keeping up?
You better have kept the receipt!
No, honey, I don't want a separation. I just want you to pick up the pace!
Will you pick up some milk on your way home?
Am I dead?
Okay Lola, I know the drill--whatever you want you get--but this is screwball; what's next?
I know I've had gas lately, but this feels extreme.
I just don't think you're pulling your weight.
Can you see the peleton from up there?
Could you pick up a quart of milk on the way?
This way, we can be first AND last!!
Daisy...Daisy...Can you hear me now?
You're right -- I shouldn't eat beans.
I see what they meant about it being hard to turn
Pothole coming up, you mind taking the lead?
These roaming charges are killing me.
Can you smell me now?
How do I release my brake?
Told ya not to buy a bike from a Fire Department yard sale
Let's go over the instructions for turning corners again.
Hey, now I'm a bike dork with extra torque!
I think we can return this turkey within 30-days...God, how stupid can we be?
These California 50/50 divorce settlement rules are a bit much.
I think we have a bad connection.
It's what I've been saying for years: you are NOT "leading from the center" and you never have been!
About Year 7 we started biking apart.
Though we may be far apart, there's a chain that binds us.
Hey, share the road!
Sometime, I would really like to talk to you face to face
It's called a marriage extender, hon.
This bike-a-thon phone-a-thon is a real stretch for fundraising!
See, now my flatulence is no longer an issue!
Pullover now, I'm having a separation anxiety attack.
ok. three more bike lengths and we will change seats.

I'm going to look for a parking place. Let me know when you get here.
Turn left on the next block.
I have bad news. It turns out that Guinness doesn't have a category for bicyclew existing in two different time zones.
Can we come back closer together; I'm sorry I called your butt fat!
Remember how dangerous it was before safety helmets?
You will soon need to Don't for get to use a different area code for calls to me after the next block or so.
I called to say I was sorry. Let's never fight during tandem bicycle design again.
Tell me again, what did we argue about?
Okay, we're reaching the final stretch now.
This doesn't count as screen time.
This tandem bike idea is a real stretch.
Remember, points off for texting and biking.
Can you pull out at the next good spot? I've got to pee!
It just occurred to me; don't we both have to cross the finish line?
I feel like there's a distance between us.
Which country are you in?
Be careful not to run over the Ds
Make a U-turn, Quick!
The "together but separate" therapy seems to be working.
Call me back when you get here.
You seem to be falling further behind.

Why won't you just let me lead by myself?
- What you said? - Come faster. Our distance is increasing!
I'll call you a minute before we get to the next turn.
On hold with Betty Ford Center ...
How am I supposed to learn if you never let me pass you?
You should be here in 1.2 seconds.
Is it raining back there?
Could you please stop following me?!
Get Off the PHONE!
Would you like sushi for dinner?
Stop texting me!
Listen, I've been thinking about us, and I know this is probably bad timing, but I don't think I can do a long-distance relationship anymore.
This bike path, still has me feeling vulnerable.
Please understand that right now I just need my space.
That's right sir, took the whole family to Lake Winnipesaukee. . . . One sec, I'll tell her to keep it down.

It's been a great ride, but I think it's time for a brake.
Don't even think about running that yellow light.
The VIP entrance is just ahead. The bell captain will help with your phone.
Do these shorts make my butt look big?
We're into the 7th spinning stretch now...
Sharp left ahead. Count to 25 ... and then start your turn.
I apologize in advance.
Keep pedalling. I'm not losing another race "by a nose."
Yeah, the divorce is getting pretty drawn out.
The air back here is a lot better.

I’m finally ready for commitment. Will you be my peloton?
I don't think this is what the psychologist meant she said to take our separation slowly.
Siri, do you think we're faster than Amazon Prime Now?
It lacks a human element.
Honestly, it's going to be the new Uber.
Are we doing this right?
Triage should be just ahead.
Am I the only one on this team who's on steroids?
How is your reception back there? I'm getting four bars up here!
Mike, please, for the last time, I'm going to break unless you stop and ask for directions.
Honey, I'm having doubts this is what they meant by "long-distance" cycling.
OK. See you when you get there.
I can't do two. How about one, does one work for you?
Montauk? No, that's too much of a stretch
You phoned me to tell me not to talk and drive?
Yes, biking at its best: no audio feedback!
Let me know if it starts to rain
Don't worry, we're in the home stretch.
I just reached Oregon. You should be here in just a few more minutes.
Er...when I said about trial separation?
Melania, if you want to go bicycling with me again, you need to pedal faster!
Maybe a trial separation would have been less complicated.

When you get there, send me a weather report.
Don't turn!
I wanted separate vacations. She didn't.
Let's do the Citi thing next time, so we can park on the street.

Yes, I scheduled my colonoscopy. No, I don't think chili casserole causes rectal cancer.
come on girl, you have to show your team work spirit to the college admission officers.
Faster. We're running out of chain.
Well, it beats the version with sociable seating.
Daisy. Give me your answer do. Over.
I’m giving you your space. I just want to feel we’re moving in the same direction.
I'm worry about the distance between us.
optimal separation, its all about optimal separation
They're phoning in the win.
Hey Darlene, yes, what's for dinner tonight?
This is the new definition of tandem.
New phone. Who dis?
If you didn't fart so much, we could have a regular tandem bike.
still married, but separated
What?
When I get to the car I'll drive back and pick you up.
Pedal faster - I can still see your sorry ass.
I may be a little late for dinner
Honey, wait up!
We've got a sharp turn coming up....
You should have gone before we left home.
It's best we keep our distance.
Would you stop and pick up some milk on the way home?
I feel like we're in a chain gang.
Sorry Frank, there's only one winner.
Go to North
You should know--there is a sharp right turn ahead
We're not going too fast Doris... Lighten up on the brakes!
What time were you planning to be back from riding?
We're failing Pinocchio's test, we need to get off our phones so that this bike stops growing.
We forgot about curves.
Yes honey, I really miss having you right behind me calling out directions.
I sure hope there aren't any turns
The space between us is growing..... I want to go in a different direction.
No, it's not a good idea if you try to pass on either side!
Einstein said this would happen!
GPS says make a U-Turn?
You've got it easy, hun. It's hailing my end!
Can you still smell me now?
Phil, Dr. Freidman was right, you have serious avoidance issues.
Want to stop for lunch?
Lets do it like we discussed. We can only make right hand turns and absolutely NO crossing the street.
Better Wi-Fi up here.
At least they're talking.
How did we become so polarized?
I don't have to ask - we can only go one direction.
Sorry, I might lose you. We're going through a tunnel.
I can't quite hear you. Come a little closer
You wanted a trial separation, remember?
No no in bike racing to give the team leader a rest you ‘break wind’ but not that way.
Jane, I fear this relationship has derailed.
But,you're first on my call chain!
It's a stretch, but I know we can improve our communication skills.
On the next corner wait for me
Maybe we shouldn't have turned onto Event Horizon Lane.
You're right, this is a really long bike ride!
I'm so glad you got rid of the stretch limo. That thing was ridiculous.
How are the tail winds, Honey?
The bet's off. I can't beat you.
I delivered on a bicycle built for two but I never promised you a rose garden.
if we go well today then sharp corners will be covered in lesson two.
What do you mean, avoidance, Emily? That's a bit of a stretch.
bust my ass all week, at the firm, at home with the kids, and my payoff is waking up at 6am on Saturdays, wobbling out onto a road built for machines that will kill me, and mashing my dick and balls around with a bunch of nerds. i live for this shit.
Hey.Got a minute?
Sorry, I'm not good with long-distance relationships.
Still no good. You're just going to have to give up on the beans.
Sorry, nobody here by that name.
We've still got a long stretch to go.
That's the rule, company president always has to finish the annual bike race in first place.
When you mentioned a long distance relationship, I thought you were moving to L.A.
What's your spin? If yours is up, mine has to be down.
I detect a distance in your voice.
Get a load of that stretch limo up ahead.
Alice. Have you left home yet?
Aren't you glad we have this quality time exercising together?
Your design brings new meaning to the word 'doping'.
I'll bet you twenty bucks I beat you to work.
You were so right about us needing more space.
On second thought, I think the limo-tandem might have been a bit of a stretch.
Wow Jack. It's still not long enough. I can still smell your exhaust fumes.
Watch out! Limbo dancers!
Damn it, they're tailing me.
C'mon hon, catch up!
Leading separate lives is NOT working out.
No, I don't think cell phones bring us closer.
When is the next turn?
That's okay, I don't think the rules apply to self important jackasses.
Don't make a scene, I'm pregnant.
Hold on, I’m heading somewhere with better service.
Lately, I've been feeling stretched.
Let me know when you get to where I am
Just my luck I had to get you for my Secret Santa.
Yea, the chili was a bad choice.
Perhaps you were right, dear, that the limo would have served us in a classier way...
Well, you said you wanted one of those "extra leg room" options.
I heard it through the tweet line. Not much longer would it be mine.
It's starting to rain up here.
But where are the drinks?
Hello, which way are we turning?
stop trying to pass me on the turn.
We're connected but I've only got two bars.
Hello? This is George." "I know hunny, it's me. Could you please pedal faster?
That pre-workout bean burrito wasn't such a good idea.
Hang on. I'm going through a fart cloud.
Hey, hon, don't forget to pick up some milk on the way home!
This thing between us isn't working out.
I'll scoot ahead and make the reservation.
Let's make a U-turn.
I have the uneasy feeling that nothing's come between us.
This isn't just a phase...is it?
We have to get closer to the speed of light if we're going to make it through that barn.
I can still hear your exertion.
I'm having second thoughts about our separation.
Relax, I saw the crossing lights.
I know, but those bluetooth ear pieces look so stupid.
Sorry you were ticketed at that last red light.
What the hell do you mean, "long distance?
You think you could pedal?
Get ready, We are entering the Central Time Zone in 3-2-1.
Daisy? ... Daisy?
Stop giving directions, or the therapist won't let us travel by car!
You said this would bring us closer.
The Museum of Relativity Displays called and they'd like their exhibit back.
So then I said... Ahhhhhk! A Tree!
When I get there, I'll tell them you'll be a little late.
And no, this is not my idea of a long-distance relationship!
Don't blame me, I reserved a compact.
Yeah, I know; the buffering is aweful.
because there is no 'far enough'
You don't have a chance by any stretch of your imagination
Next light make a left, "Yes Dear".
All I said was we wanted to go on a long bike ride.
Yes dear, I know we're running late. Just keep pedaling.
I don't know, lately it feels like we're not as we used to be. .
Left turn coming in two and a half seconds.
I see London, I see France...
It's tandem but it's not serious.
All for the love of 'who'?
I'll let them know you'll be coming behind me.
Happy 20th Anniversary, Dear.
Will you marry me?
Can I get back to you on that?
Remember when we didn't have phones?
I'll put down my phone if you will.
This long distance thing just isn't working out.
Is it still raining where you are?
Keep your voice down--the peloton is getting suspicious.
This isn't what I meant when I said I wanted a long distance relationship.
Did you fart?
Do these pants make my butt look too big?
If you don't pedal faster, you're never going to catch up.
Your shoelace is untied!
Want to stop at Mario's for pizza?
I hope this isn't considered "distracted driving".
Daisy? Is that you?
It's raining here, how 'bout where you are?
It's left right left to get in step.
I keep getting that paranoid feeling someone is following me.
We should spend more time apart.
Dead zone ahead.
Heads-up. We're crossing into the hands-free yelling only zone.
You are out of range. I am going to have to upgrade my wireless plan.
WATCH OUT for the Dds!
You’ve probably guessed by now that I’m seeing other cyclists.
don't text me, i'm steering
Hey, Lard-Ass, pick up the pace!
No Doris, we are NOT almost there yet!
Babe, the kids sure are quiet after that last turn...
Where are you now?" "I'm right behind you!
Yeah, we were tired of spinning our wheels so we decided to form a band.
No, Why is the tandem bike called the Marriage buster?
We were told not to text and drive.
I'm not sure this rubber frame was the best idea!
No way am I going to pull over to ask directions!
Sorry, no time to stop for plumber's crack.
Ahh, I'd avoid that next left on Lombard if I were you.
This time we will make the light.
It's official. The divorce is final.
Catch me if you can!
I'm almost there.
the elastic tandem only works if we both pedal
hopefully we don't get roaming charges
Ok, get ready to turn in 3... 2... 1...
So you bought this bike from David Copperfield's garage sell, huh?
We've decided to separate.
I think I need to up the restraining order past fifteen feet.
Mind shifting down honey?
I have a feeling that the "limo-bike" won't catch on
The next time we eat beans, you ride in front!
I can't say any more –– I think she's following me.
Time to double back.
I'll peel the potatoes.
I only told you we would stay in touch--not be close!!
So, flatulence problem cured?
Daisy, Daisy, send me a text or two. I'm half crazy getting a call from you.
I think the only thing you are pedaling is that you are pedaling.
This is not what I meant when I said I needed a longer chain.
Hey, did you finish yet?
It's called a limo bike.
Strengthening relationships with the Tandem Bike Messenger App!
Your calling long distance and I will not accept the chargers
My wife and I love spending time connecting on the weekends... Oh no don't worry, I've got plenty of time to chat. Wazz up bro?
I'm going to have to ask you to pedal faster... I think you are falling behind.
Can you please pedal a little faster!
Are the kids with you?
I still think that you over-reacted to my flatulence problem.
I fear you and I are drifting apart.
I'm sorry. When I peddle fast, I pass gas.
Daisy, I'm waiting for your answer.
How much farther, dad?
Hey, who's that girl I can hear talking to you!?" "Google Maps.
OK, we're in the stretch.
Curve!
By any chance, are you pulling the brakes?
Just text me
This is one of the ways we practice to be firemen.
My lawyer said a separation would have it's ups and downs.
How much further to Tommy the Tightrope Walker's house?
When I said I wanted to go for a long bike ride, this isn't what I had in mind.
I'll have dinner ready by the time you arrive.
How do we fit into a parking space?
Are you sure the bike rental only had stretch tandems left?
I'm positive we finished in first and second.
HOLD ON....Curve ahead!!!
I told you we could bond more by doing more activities together hunny...did you hear that hunny...hear what?
Woody and Mia were on to something
This is not what I had in mind when I asked for more space.
Long distance relationship.
Who said long distance relationships aren't healthy?
Mind the stares.
I am having trouble feeling connected to you
Let me know when we get to the corner.
Relax, it's just a trial separation!.
Stoker are you pedaling?
"Oh just say you won't let go!
Yeah, we're divorced, but we try to stick together for the kids.
Wide left ahead.
Don't get me wrong, I want us to reconnect but I am about to enter a tunnel.
The Agoraphobe's tandem bike
Slow down dammit.
Verizon, Is this the tethering plan you sold me?
I'm glad we found a way to keep training in the meanwhile... but once the restraining order expires, I think we should go back to the old bike.
Why? Because I'm no longer comfortable talking face-to-face.
The reception back here is dreadful!
I'm sweating too, but they ran out of stretch limos. And think, your friends will admire our minimal carbon footprint!
I called you, I'll go right and you go left.
Darling, if you pedal too we will get there before tomorrow.
I'll close the gap when you wear stronger deodorant!
I think it's important that we stay connected.
Always remember, my chain is your chain!
Butt crack!
Look...I'm just trying to connect with you.
I need your forecast when hit 10K.
Perhaps we should give each other even more space ?
I think we should've gotten a shorter bike.
Hey, trying really hard to catch up with you!
Did you get my text on ruts?
Just wondering if you can still smell my farts.
TELECOMMUTING
I know it's not a stretch limo, but think of the cardio benefits.
Get ready, Joan, we're making a left turn!
You've seemed so distant lately. We need to talk.
After all this winning, your obsession with being stuck in the past never looked better.
I don't think this is what our marriage counselor had in mind when she told us to get out of the house and do things together.
Does this count as a long-distance call?
"Rest Stop? Are you kidding me?
Next time-floss your teeth!
I heard you say 'zig zag road ahead - prepare to uni-cycle', but I still think you're taking this trial separation too far!
I'll keep your dinner warm.
Why must you always dawdle?
I am not back-pedalling! I'm just pedalling at the back.
Is it ok to make a left?
Yes, I can smell is all the way back here.
We're going to be late for the firemen's picnic!
If you want to catch up, you'll have to pedal faster!
I'm having buyer's remorse...
i'll whistle when i get to the finish line
Honey, you seem so distant lately.
No wheelies! You hear?
So you thought tandem meant "long chain"?
Careful, jumping jacks at 9 o'clock.
You want to turn right but I need to turn left -I don't think Citibike's new rideshare program is such a great idea.
Is there any reason we couldn't jump the canyon?
No, I'm not leaving you! This is just a trial separation.
If I get there first, I'll text you.
Hey Daisy, I fear we've grown apart.
We could have gotten a smaller bike if you didn't make me go on a meatless diet!
It's a tie.
It depends on your definition of stretch limo.
I'm not sure if I really like this "long distance" relationship"
It's gonna be a long ride!
We’ll be home in EXACTLY eight minutes and 25 seconds . . . well, I will.
Turn at the next corner? You've got to be kidding me.
Is it the phone that's keeping us apart?
Sorry, you're breaking up. I'm going through a tunnel.
Ding - Ding ..... Full speed ahead". "Ding - Ding, Aye - Aye Captain, full speed ahead
Yes, I promise to never eat beans again.
Hey, you know I'm lactose intolerant and after eating that ice cream last night, this is really the only way we could take a romantic bike ride.
Right turn coming up. I think we should move in together.
I think we are having bad reception.
Don't wait! I'm bringing up the rear.
If the chain breaks, honey, duck and/or jump.
You're starting to break up.
It's hard to pedal, but it gets great reception.
I sense there is a distance developing between us
I'm not sure if I really like this "long distance" relationship"
I knew you wanted a little more distance in our relationship but . . .
The whole point was to stop your back-seat driving.
I think we should get cell phones. It is hard to keep this string tight between the tin cans.
should we stop for fries or shake ?
The weak link is between you and me.
I'll have to get back to you on that.
I think you are ready for the ladder truck.
The sensation of being first never lasts ...
Yes, I sent the alimony check. It's in the mail.
I'm not sure this long distance thing is going to work out...
You're really my ball bearing and chain.
Nope, I can still smell you from back here.
We're heading into a rainy patch. I'll stop halfway in.
I know we got the tandem bike to spend more quality time together, but I feel like we never talk now.
Turn on your Wifi dammit! Turn on your Wifi!
We have 3 children. Why do you ask?
In a quarter mile prepare to make a left hand turn.
Remember.... Don't make any turn !
I AM pedaling as fast as I can!
Do you always have to beat me?
OK! OK! I won't go through any more yellow lights!
We should have married after the revolution.
No compromise, left next corner. No, I'm going right.
I told you this street is bad for potholes and black holes.
Honey, did you finish your non-GMO, organic energy gel? There's a hill coming up.
Give me a heads up before you start a turn!
Okay, ready for the final stretch?
Sometimes I wonder if we're just going through the motions.
Hey, slow down! Let me catch up!
Can you peddle a little faster, there is a train coming up ahead.
Fruit of the Loom?
quit cursing, I have to go too. try to hold in.
You're saying I look sweet upon the seat of a bicycle built for twenty-two?
Daisy, daisy, give me your answer true! Hey,your ring tone is way corny!
Also, you can't hear them anymore." "Assuming you don't butt-dial me.
At this rate, we're going to place a sign on the back of your shirt that says: "Caution. This vehicle makes wide right turns."
You forgot to turn left at the last intersection!
Even though I go through the yellow light, I still love you.
Giving each other some space really seems to be working out I think.
Pedal faster we are about to reach the elastic limit!
Jenson L. Nicholson, you just missed our turn off!
When you said your bike was a luxurious ride I didn't know it was a limo.
How long did the doctor say that we need to spend time apart?
I'm sorry, but you know the doctor told me to get more fresh air.
He's trying to stay out front as much as possible.
We're going to my mother's house whether you like it or not.
Get closer, have poor cell network coverage here!
Let's pick it up a little.
We're a great team! Too bad we don't like each other better. Hey what do we do at Harry's Hairpins!
Honey, where are the kids' bike seats...where are the kids!
Being separated has made me realize how good we were together.
This ten-speed goes up to eleven.
That restraining order is becoming a serious hassle.
Hi honey, how's the weather there?
I think it's time we admit it's over.
I'm still getting a little whiff of body odor.
Please quit calling and take up the slack.
You say you're working harder and harder and never getting ahead?
I can't hear; you're breaking up.
I do not think you are peddling fast enough.
I can't get away from you !
Did I tell you today that I love you?
Uh oh, should I have stopped for the yellow light?
Hi, I'd like to add you to my professional network on LinkedIn.
I told my wife we'd stay away from one another.
I was not texting. . .so cool it with your backseat directions!
I don't think this long distance riding is working out.
I won't be ready to talk again for another 10 miles.
Race you to the finish line.
SORRY FOR MY BAD BREATH.
Now that we're at it, I believe this is yours... It wasn't my size anyway.
Be careful at cross streets.
Yo Don, Ryan here, keep your distance!
Scotty we need more speed." "I'm giving jer all she's got Captain. She can't take any more.
What do you mean "You smell something funny"?
Let's both try to make this light so we don't get split up.
Virtual Sociality: Constantly Connected Constantly Apart
Sorry, I was on mute.
We figure that in a close contest we'd have an advantage by extending the front end.
If we win the first place trophy, try not to make any long drawn-out acceptance speech.
I'm coming on strong and not looking back.
We only have 8 or 9 miles to go.
you know we have no brakes, right?
I'm ordering a footlong. You?
Sharp right ahead! Hold on!
Turning corners is greatly overrated.
We're each on a one-wheeler considering how far away we are
Home first, I'll walk the dog.
And pedal..two three four...
Commencing countdown to wheelie mode: 10, 9, 8...
I'm glad we're expanding our workouts.
Ann, this is not the right time to discuss Bernie vs. Hillary.
Well, distance IS supposed to make the heart grow fonder.
I was trying to avoid a lengthy conversation with you.
Don't complain! You asked for a stretch vehicle.
Um... I gassed
This app senses when I've eaten beans and automatically elongates the tandem.
I'm having second thoughts about this time trial separation.
Hold your line!
Are you sure the long distance fees are based on distance?
Yeah, we can go back to using the limo.
What do you think of the bungee bike so far?
By the way, we're in third gear.
So, we can go for Mexican?
You'll find us much more economical than Uber.
I know what our therapist said, but I don't think this is bringing us any closer together.
Are you pedaling back there?
I'll call you if and when I catch up.
We're about to get a D-shaped hole in the front tire.
It's an environment friendly stretch limo.
I'm afraid our bi-coasting relationship won't survive life's ups and downs
I'll stay up till you get home.
when you have to exercise but also be always connected to bae
"Now do you see why you shouldn't have taken out that order of protection"?
You're breaking up
Hang left.
The penultimate step before divorce.
You again?
Are you lost, because I know exactly where I'm going?
Honey, I think someone is following me.
There's no use in trying to back peddle this time!
Left, then right. Then left?
Just pull over and ask someone for directions.
Give me your answer true! Exercise! Together time!
Really, I just can't do this any longer.
When I said we should get away, I didn't mean from each other.
I know separation has its drawbacks
I'll meet you for a cappuccino but don't be late like last time.
The auctioneer said the item once belonged to Plastic Man and you just had to have it.
Yo, Steve, Breitbart says we can backpedal all we want!
I still smell BO.
I think my cell service is out of range
So, apparently we're "blocking traffic!"
"you should have said something BEFORE we left"!
Yeah hunny, since I'll beat ya home, I'll pick up the kids.
Maybe it would have been easier if I would have just washed my riding cloths more often.
I resent it when you tell me I have intimacy issues.
This is the 4th time you've called today...talk about attachment issues.
No I don't, yes you do, no I........
We're trying not to upset the children.
Can you close-it-up a bit? These across-oncoming-traffic turns are pretty difficult ... and getting dangerous!
UH OH! Corner ahead!
Hey, Dad! We just missed the turn off!
It's obvious you're not pumping.
Whaddaya mean your GPS says make a U-turn?
Let's revisit why we thought a long-distance relationship was a good idea.
"Daisy, Daisy? Give me an honest answer... am I half crazy or have we grown apart?
Look- you agreed that I was far and away the better biker...
At least this isn't nearly as ridiculous as a stretched limo
Stop using your cell phone.
Let's just text each other.
Stretch Lingo
I said, " 'til death do us part".
This is a total drag!
Hello back there. Get ready for a turn....
It's time to grow up, my son.
Just keep peddling and praying that our chain has no weak link.
You didn't smell that one, did you?
This isn't what I had in mind when I suggested a separation.
I don't know if we're long distance material.
You're still breaking up. Turn left a little.
Hi.....how far?
It's a bit of a stretch, but I think it's working.
Do these shorts make my butt look big?
You slow down! I'm peddling as fast as I can.
Sure it’s awkward, but you’re the one who filed the order of protection.
Nope, reception is still bad. Can you extend back further?
Because it was cheaper per foot.
TALK TO OUR THERAPIST !!
Can you text me when you get there?
Run through another yellow, and you're a dead man.
Overbearing spouse? Try the 20 foot tandem, go the distance and get some distance.
I missed the turn. You'll have to make it.
Boy! You really meant it when you said: "No strings attached!"
I now understand what you meant by keeping your distance!
I'm feeling suffocated.
I miss our tin cans.
No, this is still not enough space.
I came second. How did you go!
Now do you believe me that longer is not always better?
Why do you always get to be at the front?
See, I told you exercising together would be a stretch.
Can't hear you, you're breaking up. Call me back in a few.
Be ready to stop in front of the shoe store !
I told unicycles are a bad idea.
You told mom it would make us closer."
Don't bother. Another Robocall.
You look sweet
Stop riding the brake.
Brake-up.
You're the one who said she wanted a long bike ride.
I think all this exercise is working, your butt looks smaller.
You can turn your data back on.
Want to stop at the bar up ahead? There are like 30 other spandex-clad bikers there, and our plan is to take up all of the seating, barely drink anything, but still somehow manage to be super fucking annoying and disruptive. Sound good?
I just talked to our divorce lawyer
Combat embarassing flatulence with our new specialist tandem!
This really beats the other model where we had to talk to each other.
I'm slowing for the stop light.
Well, we had to leave room for the activist bicyclists who'll inevitably want seats on the steering committee.
Yes, yes it's fun, but next time I want to be the caboose.
You're doing all the work? No! I'm doing all the work!
Meet you at the finish line.
You're the one who wanted to honeymoon in Bermuda.
Are you sure that the only bike rack we can use is on Pier 84?
I think our Fire Department hook-and-ladder cycling team has a chance.
Tell your mother it's only a trial separation.
Mr. President, yes I understand there are no funds left for the secret service.
I hope we can end this separation and get back together soon.
Never mind about my steering, pedal faster!
We're comin' up to a hairpin curve.
This party bike needs to be more "party" and less "bike".
Sharp curve ahead!
Hey up there! You're pedaling way too fast!
I think it's time we separated.
Let's call it : Breaking Bad: An Elastic Sequel
Hurry up, George! Why are you always bringing up the rear?
Slow down. Give me a chance to catch up.
I'm going to boldly go where no biker has gone before.
This isn't working. I want a divorce.
HELLO? I'M A BANANA!
Three crows, four sparrows, a rooster, two chickens, and three sea gulls. It's going to be tight, but it's a short ride to the sanctuary.
Let go of the brake!
I think we should go our own ways.
What a wonderful invention for business, the CEO confers with the Director even during exercise break!
That does it! Your farts are getting way out of control now.
I love you, but I'm not IN love with you.
No, this is not a bi-coastal relationship--it's an interstate.
You're breaking up...I hope we aren't in two different area codes!
I want a divorce. Do you copy? Over.
You said you have to be home at five, so I'll aim to get there at 4:55.
You didn't answer my text.
I said I call it stretch legstrong!
You really don't need this big head start.
Did you say turn left or right?
Harry, you're getting ahead of yourself.
...ok, there's the Kardashian limo...dial in your lenses
I know this makes you feel small, but I'm telling you it's just a matter of perspective.
Yeah, we're still together.
For the last time NO CALLS! TEXT!
Did you just fart?
I'm really stretched thin at the moment.
It's weird, doc. Maybe I'm going nuts, but I feel like I'm always being followed.
What do you want for dinner?
Consider yourself lucky. I had baked beans with lunch.
NOW can I have beans at our rest stops?
Peddle faster and you can catch up.
Just text me next time.
Yea, I'm way out front!
Edgar and Maureen compete in a time trial separation.
I'm starting to feel a distance between us.
I'll race you to the corner!
Not what I meant by needing more space, Jim.
You're right honey! This is much more peaceful and relaxing. We'll just have to steer with one hand now. Its no big deal. By the way, did I finish telling you about my sister's new food processor? Well she says...
We'll need to extend to 40 yards to get past this line of driver-less trucks.
You're slacking off again.
I told you, I would rather you text me.
I'm still on the line.
Our therapist said we were too enmeshed.
Maybe tomorrow we can go bowling alone.
Just thought I'd let you know I'm in California. How're things in Nevada?
I can hear you so clearly it's as if you're in the next room.
You're lagging behind. Catch up.
Exiting warp speed in 3...2...
Where's the partition on this limo?
Wouldn't it have been easier for you to take Gas-X?
You missed the turn!
You said stretch, I said bike - so I compromised.
If a couple are riding a tandem bike at 20 miles an hour while talking to each other using a 4G LTE network, which ends first: the ride, or the argument?
So I told him that I wasn't going to let a restraining order ruin our holiday.
If we don't have four children I can trade it in for something smaller
Their therapist recommended reconnecting with a couples activity; she did not recommend a tandem bike.
Why didn't you get the style with wifi?
She: "You said biking would bring us closer together." He: "Who is this please?"
No, this is Not Your Wheel and Chain!
Please don't text and ride.
So how do you suggest we take the curve ahead?
I can still smell your gas
Okay, now release the brake, and you'll see how far we go without pedaling.
No. Absolutely no! You can't ride on the handlebars.
You're right. It can't. But that doesn't seem to matter.
Yes, I still have gas!
If this marriage is going to work I'm going to need you to peddle faster honey.
That's a stretch.
It seems to me that we could move faster.
Hold on.....I'm getting another call.
Heads up! Google maps says make a U-turn at the next intersection.
I don't know why, but I still feel chained down.
The separation isn't working. She's calling her lawyer again. I tell you, Bob, this woman is putting me though hell on wheels.
No, that wasn't me - we just went past a landfill!
No! It's coming from the farm we just passed!
It's all about you, Steve, isn't it?
John and Mary had been for the past few years in a moving, long-distance relationship.
Yes, I AM GOOD. YOU can have MANY PROBLEMS with YOUR front WHEEL.
Well,the marriage counselor said that biking would bring us closer together.
Hopefully we don't get crossed signals again.
Lousy connection! Can I get back to you?
we are going to win the race by a full length!
Long distance calls
Can't talk now. Two tired.
I thought you were watching the kids.
No, we're not there yet!
I said, "Ahead Warp 1"
Stop calling me and following me everywhere I go!
Have we met?
"Can you hear me now" has been so overused - just pedal!
Beans give us fibe...Can you hear me? Damn cell towers. I said I like beans, especially in my chili...You still there? Hello?
Are we there yet? How about now?
Think of it as a climate-friendly stretch limo.
You know, I thought you were talking about our marriage when you said you wanted space.
i was running from my nightmares but they just kept following and calling me. Unwanted.
Hang up and pedal, you're falling behind!
Push it, you're falling behind!
I so enjoy these digital chain letters.
'Why do I always have to wait for you?"
Text me when you're out of the wormhole.
What have I told you about wearing a sweater when you are out for 40 days and 40 nights?
"Try not to look, since we can't turn".
Can't you see I'm busy"?
Why do you insist on back-seat driving? I know where the marriage therapist's office is!
Look, you know as well as I do, this was the only way we were ever going to go on a long bike ride with our busy schedules.
Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do.
I feel so connected to you.
One solution to a couple gas problems.
The rental is affordable, but the congestion pricing kills you.
Somehow I don't think this is what our therapist intended when we were advised to give each other more space.
Are we turning right? Right?
Call me back when we get there
I'm beating you!
. . . upon the seats of a bicycle built for two cell phones . . .
Stop freaking out. We're addressing style AND substance.
This isn't what the judge meant by a no-contact order.
I love you too and I know that distance can make the heart grow fonder, but I worry about 'out of sight, out of mind.'
Can't you wait up?
I didn't say extra large TANDEM!
I don't know if you're giving me enough space - stop calling every 10 minutes!
I can still smell your gas
Hey, now I'm a bike dork with extra torque!
I know the cutbacks have been tough this year, but we just need to work smarter.
Anoraks are back!
Stop using your cell phone up there!
Dude, we crushed our stretch goal.
Welcome to Trump International Hotel. Mexican's check in - but they don't check out!
No Joe, I'm not a back seat driver! You just needed to turn right at the light like I told you!
This trial separation isn't working for me. I want a divorce.
Trust me. You will be needing this.
I hope we don't get disconnected.
S turn coming up.
You OKAY back THERE?
Can you hear me now?
And here's a parting gift.
...I was just saying to myself how much more connected and closer we are than, most of the social-media zombie couples in the city. I should Tweet that!
Hey,how do we turn a corner?
You'll look sweet ... upon the seat ...
Suppose we could fast-track railroad crossings?
Can you move it up to 4G? As in 4th Gear?
Daisy, will you marry me?
Mitch, your plumber's crack is creepy.
Martha, if this doesn't prove flat-Earth theory I don't know what will.
Daisy, we've grown apart and I want a divorce.
We never do anything together anymore.
Stop at the next gas station. I have to pee.
If you see me turning left, I'd encourage you to do the same.
Doing fine honey. I'm leading and Jr's in fifth.
Distracted bicycling!
Is this what you meant by a long bike ride?
It's 2:15 here. What have you got in your time zone?
Winter is coming.
When do you think you'll be home?
What are you hiding under.....the ten what?
I've burned 28, you?
I farted ONE TIME!
Our counselor was right. We really do need to do more things together.
There's an obstacle up ahead. Proceed to turn right.
You must work harder to keep up with me.
You'll probably want to take this for those 40 nights.
Ok... its my turn up front.
You seem so distant lately, Dear, is something bothering you?
When you said you’d pick me up on your bike for our date…
I don't know...these long-distance relationships are just so tiring.
On a bicycle built for annulment.
The thing I love most about riding a tandem bike, it gives us a chance to share.
Pedal faster Maude! We're in the final stretch.
Bike to work day... Pick it up! I don't want my employees to see me sweating.
You said: don't invade my "space" in the relationship, so I used a phone!
There too far apart.
Communications along this stretch is an issue.
Lord, I think they would prefer manna.
She was thinking of joining us, but didn't want to be a third wheel.
Would you get to the point?
I can't-- this thing doesn't make U turns!
Honey I think I forgot to turn off the lights.
You said you need some space in our relationship.
Take this with two tablets.
We should hook up sometime.
Honey, please release the brakes.
Your underwear is showing.

"What do you mean this isn't together time?
Okay, it's been over 4 hours, we should call the doctor.
Hang a right at the corner. Your destination will be on the left.
Then we'll switch and you'll get to be way ahead of me.
How many bases do you have?
It's a hand down.
This is not the double date I thought it was going to be.
It's even a longer way to Tiparari for you.
We really should get together like this more often.
I thought of a car when you said we'd get a limo.
Yea, this is fun, as good as a stretch limo
Separate but unequal.
I CAN'T HEAR YOU!
I can't tell which is longer, my telephone calls or this bike.
Could you just blow me a kiss?
I'll stop at the bank while you pick up the dry cleaning.

My ex wife just called. She wants the bike back.
I'm turning left at the next corner.
Again. Louder. 'John Jacob Jinkleheimer Schmidt...'
I was hoping for more scenery!
Look out, stretch limo dead ahead!
And should there be a flood, consider this a token.
Okay, your call, but I guess we could squeeze a few more in!
This is when for it's not Sinais.
This is not what I had in mind when I suggested taking a nice long bike ride in the country.

And next, the omnipotent hand if Amazon Prime appeared for its first prophetic delivery.
Slow down!
It could be cold going down
The doctor said this would bring us closer together.
I told you, we have to work up to a stretch limo.

Lets do lunch sometime.

Aren't cell phones amazing?
Isn't there a commandment against emoluments?
Honey your butts getting smaller or am I farther away?
Hey, slow down, surgical tubing only stretches so far.
Prep school, James.
I think it's time we go our separate ways.
Because once again, you're late.
It's a Christmas sweater. Someday you'll understand.
If we don't make this next corner, I blame you for everything.

This is ridiculous, instead of this Tamden we should have gotten a Sociable bike.
After I hang up, I'm calling our marriage counselor.
You always said we should be close to each other but not too close...
Sharing our activities was supposed to bring us closer together.
Take this to prove that I really do exist!
I think we are entering a black hole.
It may have been me, but that was a while back.
Co-Pilot to Captain: Your selfie showed your fly is open. Why no underwear?
Our relationship is stronger than ever.
Dave, you made another smell.
You said a "bicycle built for two"....so two area codes.
In case you need to go to Brooklyn.
Haven't we met our stretch goal?
Just put it on. I wouldn't want that you should catch a cold before such an important event.
Stop calling me. The roaming charges are really adding up !
Pfft, whatever man, I was rolling through the intersection when it was still cool.
FYI It's raining here in CT
I think we may need to just finalize the divorce.

Is everything alright back there, sir?
Dial 1 when making a long distance call
This is not the break up I was referring to.
Are you you sure you used deodorant this morning?
I told you to motorize the back wheel not the front wheel
You're right. Back to the stretch limo. Global Warming be damned.
Get ready for a tight left.
Though shall not ignore washing labels on clothes. And if you're wondering why, get a load this.
I don't think the restraining order, was a good idea.
Why do you always have to ride ahead of me and not next to me?
I hope that's not how gerrymandering works . . .
Are you ready to apologize yet?
It's not a commandment; it's just a suggestion
How's the body odor issue now?
No more fresh-cut bamboo frames!
Sorry, but that's too much of a stretch.
Let's pick up the kids at that hairpin after the race.
The hairpin turn ahead is going to be a stretch.

Thank God, I always prayed for a hoodie
Isn't this such much easier than just talking?
Hey, stop coveting my hoodie
Sorry, wrong number.
Just in case you get a chilly response.
Also, thou shalt cover thy neighbor's wife.
Fine, you take the high road, I'll take the low road, and I'll be at spin class before ye.
If we switch seats, you'll be the first to get there!
You seem distant lately.
I'm stopping for coffee. Want anything?
No thanks, God. The stripes make me look fat.
You still think buying second-hand from a limo service was a good idea?
Thou shalt not freeze.
I'm afraid it's time for another round of layoffs.
This is way too much work for a tin-can phone.
Face it, you'll never catch up with me!

My marriage is going fine, why do you ask?
Does it feel like we're not as close anymore? Why do you ask?
Peddle Now....Now....Now....
you're right, this is enough space.
Seriously. Do I look good in biking shorts?
We should try this with a string and two cans!
I always thought biking with you would be a stretch.
...ello? ..an ..ou ...ear ...e now?
Let me get back to you on that.
I hate to say this, hon, but we're going to have to go our separate ways.
Roadkill!
Hey, can you smell my farts back there?
Nice try, but I still want a divorce.
This isn't what I had in mind when I said I needed space.
Pork and beans. Why?
Daisy,Daisy, give me your answer true.
I didn't call you a psychopath. I was just suggesting another path.
And they said bikers couldn't get any more obnoxious.
I'm sorry, but I've forgotten who you are.
We are going over a hill. We'll lose service for a bit.
Be careful, the limo is blocking the intersection.
Does this count toward our together time?
You're breaking up. Hope we're not in different area codes!
I've said it lots of times, and we're the proof...the family that plays together, stays together.

Can you hear me now? You need to pedal also!
If you're not going to shower, it's either this or we only bike into headwinds
Pedal slower dear, I'm only on a 3G network.
Honey, we blew up the tandem bike.
Next time you can try nose clips.
Hey, there isn't even an honor bar back here.
We're stretching it a bit for the finish.
I never feel closer to you than when we're cycling.
Hold on until I use my right turn signal app.
Another failed protest against Spectrum Internet.
We should spend more time together.
Turn right at the corner
I really feel we should take our relationship to the next level!
It's called a Garlic Lover's Tandem.
Yeah, well, I don't think that you are peddling fast enough
Uhh. . . How do we turn this thing around?
Why don't you bike up here so I can draft off you for awhile.
Follow me on Facebook.
i'll race you to the top!!
It's my turn to draft.
Can you hear me back there?
I'm just saying that I think this long distance relationship has gone on too long.
"This sucks, let's see if we can each get a refund from match.com"!
Thank you, a woderful gift-- but can you put " Moses Knows" on the front?

The next stretch of this bike ride looks fantastic.
OK, release the brake now and the Bungy-Bike will slingshot us across the finish line.
Honey, I thought a bicycle built for two would be more romantic!
We seem to be going separate ways, lately.
I see a coffee shop ahead on the right. Want to pull over?

I think she's on the phone with her divorce lawyer also.

Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
Honey, it's great you're showing an interest in my hobby, but it's not bringing us any closer together.
I'm sorry, but I think we should take our separation more seriously.
Remember this bike is not front-wheel drive.
Let's try, 'You choose where to go.'
