Looks like Sammy wins the "bring your pet to work" contest. He ate all of the other entries!
Anywhere but Eve's office.
We're searching for rats that escaped from the subway's Track 23 dining room kitchen.
Looks like you ordered from the wrong Amazon
Speak softly and carry a big fish.
We may want to let him work from home.
That goes in Eve's office.
If anyone starts singing 'That's A Moray' they're fired.
It's a pet of the one-armed guy 9 back who is carrying it to the shredder.
I said we should get stuff from Amazon, not the Amazon.
It looks like we have a reptile dysfunction.
No you fools, I told you to hire a civil SERVANT"
You ordered from the wrong Amazon again, didn't you?
No, what I said was we need more stakeholders.
Tell the front desk to bring doughnuts and a small rabbit to the conference room.
Is that from Amazon?
The word is he did great things over at Apple.
I hope this means the toilet is now working.
I see we're finally cleaning out the fridge.
Sir, you should probably assume your human form for the shareholders meeting.
Ah. My Amazon delivery.
Not as charming as the gecko, but we'll give it a shot.
I said we need stakeholders.
Let's start thinking in the box.
I thought Milton Berle was dead.
No. What i said was, "We need a gigantic shake up here."
Just add it to the list of possible side effects.
Didn't work out in accounting. Turns out he's only an adder.
Ok fine, I'll call the plumber.
Couldn't we just get a shredder?
Right, never too early to bring in Legal.
Why, no I haven't seen Bob. Why do you ask?
No - I did NOT say I had 'a reptile dysfunction'!
He's transferring in from legal.
Just remember to wipe down the microwave when you're done
Put a tie on him and get over to Fox News.
Now, that's a moray!
It's the last envelope he has to lick.
Let me guess--first time ordering from Amazon?
If it tells you to try Apple products, resist the temptation.
I think we should stick with pink slips.
Predatory lending is down the hall.
We found what was jamming the printer.
No, no, I asked if you guys could find Ann a condo.
This decision may come back to bite us.
I see you've found the cause of the paper jam.
Let's stick with the gekko
Tell him again , we don't use Apple products here and we won't be tempted to.
I don't think I.T. entirely understood my mouse problem.
I said I wanted a bigger STAKE in the company.
No, what I said was that we need a bigger STAKE in the company.
Get him a desk in Legal.
I thought we agreed not to invite Legal to this meeting.
Oh dear, another case of reptile dysfunction.
I'm afraid this idea doesn't have any legs
Um, I think we should go back to thinking 'inside the box'.
I think we figured out the reason for the huge employee turnover on the fourth floor.
His résumé said he used to work at Amazon, which is technically true.
Put him in charge of low-hanging fruit.
Impressive, but the other attorneys brought a mongoose.
We've had complaints that your emotional support animal keeps eating other emotional support animals.
We need to clean the refrigerator more often.
I know what it looks like, but the guy's got a killer resume.
I see you've brought along your own lawyer.
So it is a hostile takeover.
I said, "Bring me the rep file."
So you think you know where my left arm is?
He's in his office. Why?
Surely you can find a better 2-hole punch?
I meant, "snack". Damn autocorrect.
Mine's bigger.
I thought we weren't bringing our attorneys.
I see the boss hired another relative.
I didn't know we were bringing in outside counsel
Whatever you do, don't assign him an office near Eve.
...and so we're letting both of you go, but you are eligible for COBRA.
I meant the kind plumbers use.
I said I want you to be 'Stakeholders'!
No, I'm quite sure it was "stakeholders," a meeting of all STAKEholders.
I see they sent someone from corporate this time.
No, no, no - I said we needed a couple of new "stakeholders"!
Wow, mystery solved! I thought people were just on vacation.
Actually, I called a meeting of the large stakeholders.
Sorry guys, the agenda should have said stakeholders, not snakeholders.
No need to introduce yourself.... you must be my wife's attorney!
Take him to accounting - they could use another adder.
I'm afraid you can't bring your service animal anymore. Some of your coworkers are feeling constricted.
I din't say "anaconda" I said "add a comma"!
We're tax attorneys. The taxidermists are on the third floor.
I'll tell the boss you found his chihuahua.
I think she wanted a FEATHER one.
No, this is accounting, you're looking for legal, that's up on 10.
"Guys, there is no need to reinvent the eel".
Oh good, Legal has arrived.
I think his management style might be too constricting.
I know today's the 'Bring Your Pets to Work Day' but many people say they couldn't find their pets anymore...
Add him to the office pool.
Anything found in the employee fridge without a name and date gets tossed.
There must have been a typo in the notice. This meeting is for STAKE-holders.
When did we go open carry?
I didn't mean it literally! Take that back and bring me an actual lawyer.
That's the last time we use Monster.com.
Python is a programming language, you nitwits.
Make sure he completes the sexual harassment training.
You'd better run that by Legal... oh, wait. That is Legal.
I said add one percent, not one serpent.
I wasn't expecting anything from Amazon!
No, no. I said, 'We should buy a bigger *stake*.'
Maybe we should cancel our Amazon Rewards Program.
I said I wanted an extra large shake.
It's our biggest idea, but it has no legs.
I thought his resume said worked at Amazon, not in the Amazon.
I didn't know Legal was hiring.
I see that there was a typo in my 'Haul-your-asp-to-my-office' memo.
The employee you need to terminate is in the first office on the left.
The meeting was for STAKEHOLDERS...
I said get me a large SHAKE!
I'm not sure we have that kind of wiggle room.
No....What I said was that I want to meet our stakeholders.
Well, that explains the missing lab rats.
Devour the Competition was a metaphor.
He is a lifetime civil serpent.
No wonder it wouldn't flush.
This just came from Amazon.
I'll let you handle his exit interview.
Reptile dysfunction?
Well, he has some of the qualities we're looking for!
Release him in personnel. We need to downsize.
I don't think that qualifies as an Emotional Support Animal.
Just when we got rid of the 800 lb. gorilla in the room!
Where was he this time?
Johnson? No. I haven't seen him all week.
A mousetrap would have sufficed.
Is this why none of our computers have a mouse?
Sure beats the whoopee cushion we got him last year!
Better count the interns while your at it...
I was hoping we could resolve this without bringing legal in.
I said, ASAP. Not ASP.
"I see they are finally hiring in the legal department'
Yes, but we'll never have to lick another envelope.
Wow, you guys have been really hauling asp today.
Legal? Third door on the left.
Wrong floor. Legal is on twelve.
I said I wanted a bigger stake in the business.
He gets a new water bowl every morning and a live intern in the afternoon.
No, no, I was asking to meet with the "stakeholders."
I think I liked the elephant in the room better.
Previous work in Eden, huh? Put him in sales.
No, not an ad campaign for reptile dysfunction.....
Another reptile dysfunction?
I don't think your idea has any legs.
Corporate wants something with legs.
Put it in legal with the others.
I was imagining a different sort of scalability.
I assume you're here for the Snakeholder Meeting?
No, I said I liked the eclectic feel around the office.
Remember to set him up with a touchpad. We don't need a repeat of the mouse incident.
Well, he did put 'strangles the competition' on his résumé.'
Well, Mr. Trump did want a running mate who was more likeable than him.
OK, guys, all the mice are gone. Get rid of it before questions about Mr. Johnson's Bull Dog comes up.
Sorry, we have to let you go. We're scaling down.
I'm in no mood for metaphors
Finally a cold-blooded pragmatist around here.
I said "Send in the stakeholders"...
Take him upstairs. He'll be working in legal.
Take that to Eve in produce.
has anyone seen Bob in accounting?
I mean nobody's LinkedIn profile is completely honest.
I never thought our IRS audit would be done by a civil serpent.
Gentlemen, your proposal hasn't got a leg to stand on.
It's the new hire from Amazon.
I may have mumbled.... but I know I said STAKEHOLDERS MEETING
Inhuman Resources, third floor.
Careful, he's on the Boa Directors.
Just so you know, Eve has filed a sexual harassment suit.
On second thought, let's call a plumber.
You know, everyone else catches Pokemon at lunch.
That's it, Bill, you're fired – and take your two handlers with you.
Before you let him go have him sign this release form.
Morey. I said bring me Morey,
Yes, That would be my Amazon order.
The client changed their minds again...they're staying with the gekko.
Just put it with the others.
"I told you idiots to hire a civil 'servant'...
'We've got to come up with a better way to seal envelopes.'
It's not eligible for COBRA benefits.
No guys, I told you I needed a good Boeing contractor.
I said to find a civil SERVANT
Let HR handle it
You misunderstood me. I want each employee to have a STAKE in our company.
You're too late, they settled 5 minutes ago.
... and finally, you can't type worth a damn.
I hate these team building exercises.
We're going to need a few more rules for "Bring your pet to work day."
Let's get you into hair and makeup, Mr. Trump.
Reread the memo. The boss wants something from Amazon, not from the Amazon.
No, no--that memo was about stakeholders.
I'm getting a bad feeling about my missing intern.
It was a metaphor, guys.
I think the staff will be more productive with fewer constrictions.
Wouldn't a couple of mouse traps be easier?
Put him in the conference room with the other attorneys.
Ah, I see the Legal Dept. has a new intern.
The other lawyers are in the conference room.
Is that my Amazon delivery?
You want the den of vipers — that's up one floor in pharmaceuticals.
Remember when we used to just give people pink slips?
This will be the last "bring your pet to work" day.
The rat race seems to attract them.
Take that back to Trump Tower where you found it.
No wonder the copier was jamming.
Well, that explains my missing mongoose.
Let me guess - another team building exercise.
I'm relieved. I thought we had a mole.
The good news is, we no longer have a whistle blower problem.
Bob, it looks like we'll have to move your therapy snake further away from Ms. Jenning's therapy rabbits.
I see Bob made an asp of himself at the board meeting again.
Get Him a suit and tie, he's due in court in an hour.
Maybe we should just let the plumber handle it.
This way, Mr. Ailes. Your new host body is waiting in Mr. Trump's office.
Welcome to Goldman Sachs, you'll fit right in.
If you had cleaned out the break room fridge when you were supposed to, you wouldn't have this problem.
Well, we found out what happened to Janet from accounting.
Good to have legal back.
I'm tempted, but knowing good from evil might cramp our style.
"Take it up to legal, and get it a desk.'
The other lawyers are waiting in Conference Room B.
I hate bring your pet to work day.
Good solution, but is it scalable?
Tile Rep. Reptile. Anyone could make that mistake.
Put him in the CEO's chair and see if anyone notices.
He ate Simpson's Viagra.Hurry- or you'll never get him in the elevator.
If it fits, it ships!
I think we've found the reason for the printer paper jam.
I ordered a large "SHAKE."
"Tell me again what's wrong with the old mouse trap".
I think you misunderstood "from" Amazon.
Finally, an intern who won't be wanting a stand-up desk.
Eve will be here in a few minutes with her side of the story.
Isn't there enough venom in this department already?
No, no! I said that I wished that I had a larger stake in the business.
This is the absolute last time I send you two guys out for sushi!
No, NO! I said I wanted our employees to be big STAKEholders.
Any luck finding that missing intern?
Right, sorry millennials, I meant Monty Python.
Now that's a better mouse trap.
Nice asp Ted.
I want everything converted from Python to Java by this afternoon.
This is Sales. You want HR.
Sales haven't improved. Release it on level three.
I knew he was a snake when we hired him.
I see you finally decided to clean out the breakroom fridge.
I see you found our closer.
Which one of you is the lawyer?
I asked for a large shake.
Get him out before Eve files another harassment suit.
Cripes! I told you two to find my aunt a condo!
Don't try to tell me that's a service animal.
Make him comfortable. A client is a client!
I don't think your new pet project has legs.
Yeah, Don gets like this. Just let him sleep it off in his office.
Have you guys seen Bill?
So, we're literally going to be selling snake oil?
So, I take it the rats are back.
Shouldn't he be down in Legal?
This the guy saying go with Apple?
Can you guys help me install Python?
That's not exactly what I had in mind when I said that our company needs a robust COBRA plan!
Which law school?
Ooh...someone's in for a tongue-lashing.
Impressive growth in the first quarter
Forked tongue? P.R, must have ordered it.
Word of advice: if he offers you an apple, don't eat it.
He's a comfort snake--here's the paperwork.
Isn't there a simpler way to terminate Jensen?
If Johnson keeps on mixing up "literally" and "figuratively" he will never make partner.
Just put it on my desk. I'll have my secretary take care of it.
Johnson, your emotional support animal has eaten another IT guy.
I guess we should have specified what we meant by pet project.
Well ... This certainly explains the dwindling secretarial pool!
No, I said, 'Get me a big stake in the company'!
I see you found what was jamming the copy machine.
I said I wanted to meet with all of our STAKEholders
Now they’ll know the meaning of deadline.
He's from corporate.
We're cleaning out the break room fridge.
So that's why the printer was jammed.
Take him over to sales, he'll fit right in.
Whatever, but all emotional support animals must be cleared with HR
There's an empty cubicle between Adam and Eve.
When I told you to get me the biggest snake in town, I meant a lawyer.
I'm sorry. The job offer was for a civil servant.
So all that anti-virus stuff doesn't prevent these?
His desk is over there, but I think he'll need more than one mouse.
If it's an adder, stick it in accounting. If it's a constrictor, put it in sales. If it's poisonous, put it in the CEO's office.
Put him in with Legal.
I'm pretty sure that was a spelling error.
We're just showing the new civil serpent around the office.
It says right here: '...and other duties as assigned'.
I wasn't told we'd be getting a visit from Corporate today.
Adam and Eve are in Conference Room B.
You guys didn't mention the forked tongue. Let's put him in the legal department.
When you said you had to go "drain the snake" I thought...
Oh, good! That must be the new adder for accounting.
We're missing two kids from Take Your Child to Work Day.
His resume looks good, but typing skills are going to be an issue.
If he tries to get you to eat an apple, don't.
So that's what was causing the paper jam
Get your asp back to work!
No, no, no. Hire a civil *servant*!
Sorry for the typo. This meeting is for STAKE-holders.
Gentlemen, I'd like to introduce Donald Trump's newest campaign manager.
Great, another bottom-feeder.
We're selling the oil, not the snake!
Dare I ask how it went at the aquarium's bankruptcy hearing?
I said I wanted a large SHAKE.
Let's put it in the pipeline and see what happens.
Damn auto-correct! That was suppose to say ASAP, not ASP.
So that's what was jamming the copy machine.
I can't believe he made partner before me.
It came with my Amazon Primal subscription.
Trump's changed campaign managers again.
I don't think you guys quite grasp the concept of carrying COBRA.
They're draining the typing pool.
Can you get it to cough up Caruthers' ID badge?
I trust this will take care of our poodle problem.
I misread the memo: management wants a new constructor.
Hopefully this will get us the conference room
Has anyone seen Johnson?
Seat him with the other candidates.
This should finally put an end to our capybara problem.
So this is our competitive response to the Gecko.
It's tempting....
This floor is accounting. Lawyers are on 19.
COBRA Insurance? Take that to Human Resources.
Conference room 2A. Mrs. Edith Higgins doesn't want to settle.
Anyone seen the boss's chihuahua?
Is this the new government mandated COBRA policy?
"When you said 'therapy pet,' I just assumed 'dog'.
I wish I could accommodate that, but I'm afraid we don't have any wiggle room.
If you have reptile dysfunction, I know of a cure.
This is Accounting. Legal is on the 5th floor.
That's a moray?
It seemed like a good idea, but it didn't have legs.
Last time I'm going to tell you, gentlemen, jackets are required in the office.
Don't get sushi at Costco.
Have either of you seen the intern?
I see legal is moving again.
Now find a huge peanut brittle can.
Finally...someone to swim with the sharks
Show Roger Ailes replacement to his office.
Has anyone seen the intern?
I hate the paleo diet.
He may lack the necessary venom to be a good executive.
Why is it that none of your ideas ever seem to have legs?
Just keep it away from Eve in accounting.
Thanks for cleaning out that refrigerator.
You really have no idea what the company cobra policy is, do you?
I said, "seal the deal," not "steal an eel."
So much for "bring your pet to work" day. Now we'll need a new accountant.
I asked for 2 "stakeholders"!
When he first started here he was electric but I'm afraid the time has come to let him go.
The Donald's new campaign manager
Can't you guys catch "Pokemon" like everyone else?
Eve says, 'he knows too much'.
OK. Grab a rabbit out of my office, but I want him back on the phones in thirty.
I don't think that is what the plumber wanted.
Sorry, there was a bit of an auto-correct issue. We actually need a giant cake.
Are you here to carry out our new COBRA policy?
That's what was causing the paper jam?
It's going to be interesting to see if Thompson wiggles out of this one.
Put him in the think tank.
Take him straight to Mergers and Acquisitions. They'll get along just fine.
Yikes! Another delivery from Amazon?
I thought I told you get your asp back to work.
Isn't it a bit premature to bring in legal counsel?
Take Mr. Trump's new campaign manager to the staff room.
This is supposed to be a friendly meeting, guys. No need to bring legal counsel.
No, no, no,no!" "I said buy Anaconda Copper not a copper anaconda.
Have him squeeze the joy of living out of Perkins in Accounting, and then Stevenson in IT if you've still got time.
We finally found where the rattle was coming from
I don't think this needs to go to HR, but if it's in the break room fridge and nobody's name is on it... fair game.
Another creative team-building exercise?
Book him for conspiracy and temptation.
I can't tell you interns that it gets better. Just different.
Good. The mouse is in Keebler's office, but be warned, he's pretty big.
Another eel-mail scandal.
I ordered it from Amazon
Sorry -- we only hire sharks.
Does this mean that the audit is over ?
When I told you to bring me the biggest, baddest, forked tongue snake in the grass you could find, I thought you knew I meant a personal injury attorney.
Dammit, I've told you interns before: snakes go to Legal, crabs go to Accounting, and it's nothing but monkeys here in Marketing.
The good news is we found that computer virus.
Legal's down the hall and to the right.
That's great. But now the toilet on the THIRD floor isn't working.
I said to make sure we get a huge "stake" in the deal!
He'll fit in with our work culture just fine.
No, no, no! I said we should have a bigger stake in Textiles!
They were all out of therapy dogs.
Idiots! Bring Your Snake to Work Day was yesterday.
We love him for the job; he just has to learn to hold his tongue.
When she said Bob showed her his snake, I just assumed it was a euphemism.
I was told that outside attorneys would not be brought it.
That explains the poor attendance at the daycare center.
Shouldn't we just call a plumber?
I think his cubicle office was just too constricting.
I'll inform the boss that our legal counsel is here.
For Chrissake! I specifically said, 'We're angling for the one percent,' not one serpent!
No you idiots. A plumber's snake.
I thought you hired Anna Conda!
I see on your resume you used to run Fox News?
I knew you'd come crawling back here for work.
I'd prefer to interview the other candidate first.
When I said buy Anaconda I didn't mean..........
I thought your new Viper was a car.
Just put it over there with the rest of the hedge fund traders.
I meant Python, the computer language.
Next time, remove "killer instinct" from the job description.
Toilet in the executive washroom clogged again?
It's a better idea than the whale from last week's cartoon; I'll give you that much.
Yes, well, catch and release him someplace else.
Good riddance -and let's start looking at those resumes a little more carefully.
We're taking legal out to lunch.
I see you guys met our new corporate lawyer.
On second thought, I'll just call a plumber.
Online she said she was slim and curvy.
Sorry, HR says no therapy snakes.
So... I see you've found yet another reason to abandon your cubicles.
Have you guys seen Larry?
Is the takeover getting hostile?
Thanks guys, but I can lick the envelopes on my own.
Don't forget to confiscate his security pass and executive lavatory key.
Oh, I see we're staffing up for another hostile takeover.
We need to revisit our "Bring Your Pet to Work Day" policy.
I'm glad to see you two are finally learning Python.
Wow, they really are attempting a hostile takeover!
I'll try flushing the toilet again.
Yours is bigger.
He seems eager enough. Get him started on hedge funds.
It alarms me your first solution wasn't a mousetrap.
They brought their attorney too.
the boss said get her the present from amazon .com not THE AMAZON
He say's he's the original Apple salesman
I see you boys found more than a bug in the mainframe.
Is that going to Human Resources or Legal?
I'm guessing you couldn't find the plunger.
Have any of you seen my mouse?
No, you are right. Birthday snake does sound a lot like birthday cake.
Open desk in legal?
I think we all owe Paul an apology for blaming the recurring men's restroom issues on him.
I'm pretty sure he asked for an extra large shake.
You're going to need more than this doctor's note to get that approved as a service animal.
We may need to tone down the job description.
But is your idea scalable?
We found him buried in the disclosure document.
30 years and all I get is a lousy snake?
Urban myth my ass.
Leave it beside the corporate ladder.
Rats in the board room again?
Let Wilson's wife know that he won't be home for dinner.
I didn't realize you had invited Legal to this meeting.
Put him in the corner office and feed him an intern once a day.
I thought I said no attorneys.
Have Inhuman Resources interview him
I know he's difficult, but he gets results.
They do this twice a week at Google.
Sorry, we've decided to settle.
I asked you where's our stake in this company!
Can this wait?
Let's see how his background check goes before we make any final decisions.
Stop trying to reinvent the eel.
I'm sorry but the company finds your management style too constricting.
How did he get past the second interview?
He's the new Director of Scales and Aquasitions.
now we put our logo on it and release back into the wild
We were told the toilet was clogged and to bring a snake quickly.
I dont think that's what the plumber meant
Take it to Legal. Should feel more comfortable there.
The Rat's in his corner office.
Are you sure this is how you snake a toilet?
I appreciate your thought to save money for the company but I think it is best if we call a plumber to snake the drain.
Lawyers' suite down the hall on the left.
I see you have been ordering from Amazon again.
Life was so much easier when CEOs were warm-blooded creatures who could walk.
I could have sworn that my meeting with legal was tomorrow...
Why don't you boys work from home tomorrow?
I asked you to find me Anne and Rhonda.
Place it by the door that says Customer Complaints.
Can you also take care of that rat in HR?
Mr. Trump replaced our campaign manager again?
Sorry to see you go, Gary. Luckily, your COBRA benefits are pretty sizable.
Legal's on 34.
No, what I said was, 'This office needs an electric feel.'
Put him in sales...with the others.
There's a rat here in Internal Affairs, and we're going to find him.
I see you brought your lawyer.
Oh no! Don't tell me we're switching to Python.
This definitely isn't what Greg meant when he said "we need a snake for the men's toilet."
Let HR tell him that he has to pay for COBRA coverage.
What's the catch?
Drain clogged again?
What I said was we need a large 'shake' up to get the company back on track.
Not quite the 800-lb gorilla we need, but it will have to do
Take him to legal - he'll find a rat or two.
Maybe it was someone she ate?
Our toilet is fixed, boss!
When I told you to get rid of Fizby, I meant fire him.
He's all right - he's just a little rattled.
Put him in a cubicle next to the corporate lawyers.
Is that the new COBRA specialist from HR?
Don't tell me we're doing business with that snake again.
I need someone who can be a little more hands-on
You can just leave it on Adam's desk.
Eve and her attorney are in the large conference room.
You drained the swamp, gentlemen, deal with the consequences.
No, no, no. That is not what I meant when I said snake the toilet in the men's room.
When I said get me a BOA representative, I was talking about the bank
His resumé left out one important detail.
What's wrong with the boss?
Eve, in HR, said she was expecting him.
Eve's office is down the hall on the right.
Just put it in the boardroom with the other directors.
When you're done walking him I'm going to need you to let him eat you.
That will teach you to put the seat down.
Oh good, you found him! Now we just have to find Miss Petry.
Put him under Eve's desk.
It's for the boss from his wife!
No, no! The kind you use in plumbing!
We don't need legal at this meeting.
He's been working here how long -- and he still doesn't know his ass from his elbow.
Going in for the kill on the Patterson deal?
When I asked for an adder, I meant a calculator.
They're really going to grill him in personnel.
And be sure to add "Problem Solver" to your resumes.
Put him in with the lawyers.
Is this the last of Ailes' personal belongings?
The exterminator is missing.
It is a long story.
Thanks. My meeting with her divorce attorney is in the conference room.
Another hissy fit?
I understand, but you're supposed to order supplies from Amazon, not *the* Amazon.
When I said the new hire needs to be flexible, this is not what I had in mind.
I meant we need a lawyer.
"We'll need a replacement for Perkins in accounting".
That goes in the moat around the corner office.
He prefers a mouse instead of a trackpad.
That isn't the lying snake I was talking about
So I see you guys figured out the plumbing problem
I meant C-O-B-R-A.
Legal is just down the hall, to the left.
Amazon is located on the third floor.
Ah, I see that Trump's new campaign manager has arrived.
The downsizing of the Law Department is going as we expected.
I said I wanted to a large STAKE in the company.
We've been acquired by Amazon.
Put him in the conference room with all the other snakes.
I said to, "seal the deal" not "steal the eel."
Put. It. Back.
You've been caught embezzling, Jenkins. It's time to pay the viper.
Then again maybe we'll skip the group hug this morning.
We’re out of tranquilizer darts; use Billings’s PowerPoint presentation.
Sorry Neil, you just didn't have the backbone for the job.
Bring your pet to work day may not work out so well for Molly's rat in accounting.
Have you shown the IT guys how you're using Python?
we've never had to handle a problem of this scale before
This is not what I meant when I said we needed a coldblooded negotiator
When I said a toilet needs to be snaked, this isn't what I had in mind.
We'll get back to you as things evolve.
That's a cold blooded response to the no dogs policy.
We've covered the whole floor but we still can't find Harry in accounting.
Take him back to his office, and get another attorney to take over his caseload.
I see you met our new hire, Anna Conda. Watch out, she's a hugger!
He'll need a visitor pass
I can't wait for this audit to end.
No Smedley - memo clearly says we need a big shake up here.
Is it casualty Friday already?
It says here his name is Monty
"Legal" is on the top floor.
He's my emotional support python.
Put him in the conference room. Maybe that'll shorten our meetings.
I see you've met our legal counsel.
Finally! A green solution to our rat problem.
I said the Cobra Insurance Policy...
You guys seen Frank?
On your way to express some venom?
Bring Your Pet To Work Day was last Friday, guys.
Legal is on 6.
Morning, Boss.
The lawyers are in Conference Room B.
Good morning. Eve in accounting speaks very highly of you.
Let 'em go boys. Apparently creating original sin isn't a crime.
This isn't another one of your stupid ice breakers, is it?
I completely forgot we had a meeting with our lawyer today.
I assume that's the boss's kid?
Put him in Adam and Eve's cubicle.
I think it's about time we stopped with Bring Your Pet to Work Day.
I knew right away he was slippery.
It's okay, she's an emotional support animal.
I guess we'll find the mole once and for all now.
So this is the best candidate you could find on monster.com?
I'm sorry, guys. We're firing your big lazy asp.
"Good, now go fix the toilet.
The toilet isn't THAT clogged!
The whistleblower is in the last office on the left.
Keep that thing away from my mouse!
He was in the copier the whole time.
Careful--that's Mr. Trump's next campaign manager.
Well, that should complete our diversity hiring program.
Thanks guys for cleaning out the office fridge
He's sick of working on the Amazon account
It would have had legs, but the 3D printer ran out of ink
We've got to clean out the stock room more often.
Corporate says having a common enemy in the office will increase productivity.
You're gonna need a bigger cubicle.
Now I know why my mouse keeps disappearing.
Allow me to introduce the new manager of corporate drug pricing.
Still cleaning out Roger's office?
Gift it to our Florida office.
Morning, boss. Looking good.
We ended up going to Costco.
He last worked for Bernie Madoff.
You say you got it from Amazon.com?
You guys must be the new collectors from our predatory lending department.
He never warmed up to the job.
Put him in Jake's office—his computer has some bugs.
Sir, we now know why our interns go missing.
There's too much venom in this workplace already.
It was a metaphor.
Take him over to legal with the rest of them.
How did he do in the interview?
You can't believe a word he says.
When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, that's a moray!
We're lawyers. You're being redundant.
That is one serious computer bug.
I heard we merged legal and HR.
He'll be perfect for the think thank.
So...I guess Marge WAS right about the copier.
Scales person was a typo, Jeffrey.
On second thought, I think you both deserve raises.
Miller - you old snake! What are you doing here?
We're going to allow him to say he resigned.
IT says we have to change our computers to Apples.
Mr. Trump says he no longer has time for old friends.
He's a long-time legend in Apple Marketing.
And now, gentlemen, we squeeze the competition.
One more hissy fit and you're outta here!
Cake, guys, I said bring back a big cake.
Hurry. Mr. Trump is waiting. He's running low on venom.
The Legal Department is on the 3rd floor.
I knew there'd be a catch!
Eve's alibi checks out but Adam's does not.
When she kissed him he was supposed to turn into a frog!
Couldn't we just hire a lawyer...
When I said bring me back anything for lunch, I should've been more specific.
Tell Mr. Trump we already have a penis for the statue.
OK, now all we need is the oil and a salesman.
Well Google has one.
Glad to see our legal team is prepared.
Put him in with the other lawyers.
Good move, transferring Larry from PR to Collections.
When he sobers up, tell him he's fired!
Have him transferred to human resources.
Wow. These darn computer viruses are getting scarier and scarier.
You guys came quick. The mongoose is in the conference room.
I said, 'Order me a large CAKE.'
They were out of California Rolls.
I didn't know our Legal Department was hiring again.
I see you IT guys found the bug.
The exterminator's arrived, sir.
No, it can't go in the secretarial pool
I said pick me up a steak for lunch
Assign him to the mailroom. He can lick stamps.
Adam, that goes in Eve's office.
The IRS guy is camped out in Cubicle 23.
You're kidding., out of the men's toilet?
you said it would be as popular as the Gekko!
Yes, you're fired. But you can apply for Cobra.
Cobra insurance and that's not a cobra.
On the other hand, he does meet 99% of our criteria for president.
I was thinking more like a talking gecko.
Have him lick both the envelope and the stamp.
Have we finally landed the Slytherin account?
Legal Department is down the hall.
Can you please just send your Amazon deliveries to your home address?
Finally some diversity on 'Bring your pet to work day.'
these computer worms are getting bigger
Sushi for lunch again?
It's Sushi Tuesday.
We do not need a totally organic paper shredder.
You must be the new hire from Amazon.
Per today's memo, we're going to adopt predatory pricing.
Now I see why most of your decisions were eel advised.
I miss 'don't ask, don't tell'.
A gift from your wife.
Put it in Ted's office with the others.
Sorry 'bout the typo, guys. Memo should have read, 'Order big, healthy SNACK for staff meeting.'
That wasn't what I meant by diversity.
Bring him into the conference room for exit interviews.
'Jenkins, two cats and a hamster have gone missing on Bring Your Pet To Work Day. Any thoughts?'
So, that's why Bill missed the meeting.
Inhuman Resources is upstairs.
This will be great for diversity.
We settled the case out of court. Please put the attorney back in his box.
You were right. There WAS something fishy in accounting!
We talked to legal; it is probably better if you don't know.
Nah, I'm good, I brought a sandwich
Have you seen Jarvis?
Cleaning out the office fridge?
That's great, guys, but it was just a metaphor.
He will be sitting in Legal.
Find the printer jam?
Right now it's set on "vibrate". We can do "silent" when the meeting starts.
No you morons, I said I wanted a large steak.
If this doesn't get him to sign the contract, then nothing will.
It says stakeholders.
Get him under the heat lamp before his 3:30.
So that's what the rattling noise in the air conditioning was.
I said ‘a nice big steak’.
I said come back with a big deal, not eel.
I said to bring me a "bid on a condo". Damn autocorrect.
You guys going out for a bite?
Pretty sure COBRA insurance doesn't cover that.
I said a big shake you idiots.
Says right here on the invite: "Gag gifts only."
Ah, another visitor from Corporate
We have a Cobra Plan but that's not it!
"Wolf" of Wall Street was trademarked.
This is exactly why I distrust teams.
I told you Johnson was a snake. Now get rid of him.
You can take it back, I'm licking the envelope myself.
Is it Anaconda Wednesday already?
I'll just go ahead and order a new mouse.
No I said 'Civil servant!' Not 'Serpent!'
I see legal is moving offices again...
We caught him hissing up to senior management.
That explains all the hissing at the board meeting.
I'm pretty sure the office-party memo said to bring your own SNACKS...
We'll find the elephant in the room, next.
I said please bring me a snack.
I asked for Anna Conda - the accountant!
We used to give a gold watch.
Sorry guys, the boss is now thinking cuddly.
Ah, this must be the new head of litigation.
This company needs to shed its old skin if we want the business to achieve greater scale.
HR has some issues with your vetting process.
No, no, NO! I asked you to bring me a large SHAKE for lunch!!
On second thought, let's just dazzle them with our brilliance.
Really? You have to ask? Any bathroom he/she wants, okay?
Have you seen Jenkins around?
Hey guys! Great job getting the worm out of our IT system.
I'm not sure Brazil will believe we extradited the right swimmer...
No, No! It's a long feathery scarf for strippers!
Put him on the Trump account, I hear he's looking for a new campaign manager.
But is it scalable?
Is that the new head of Legal?
Thanks boys. He goes to the Hostile Takeover department.
Excellent! You can dump the old CEO in the Everglades.
Hey. The snake is out. They want a giant duck.
Good, right in time for the peer reviews.
Any sign of the apple?
We'll need plenty of wiggle room on this issue.
The corner office, of course.
Nabbed him in the lobby atrium, by the apple tree.
Says here that the boss wanted a burger and a SHAKE ...
Make sure you take it to a gender neutral bathroom.
It's weighty yes, but Frank says the story has no legs.
No thanks. I brought a sack lunch.
I'm beginning to think the "Thank You" card that came with might not be sincere.
The boss says its forked tongue is perfect for customer service.
We're going to need a bigger mouse.
Have either of you seen Florence from accounting?
I think it's time we go back to mousetraps.
If you should accidentally drop it from the roof, put me down for boots and a matching belt.
I told HR we needed a cold blooded killer in sales.
Sushi for a year. It’s part of your severance package.
New guy in Legal?
No need to be vile. After all, I am a civil serpent.
Is this the new lawyer?
I always said this office needed fewer snakes and more sharks.
Thank goodness you're here! Our bathroom sink has been clogged for a week!
The pipes are all clear. You can go in now.
There's no such thing as 'Bring Your Snake to Work Day'!
No, close, but that's not the one we're looking for.
"Sorry fellas, they just announced today is actually 'Take Your Pet and Go Home Day.'
So this is the new campaign manager.
Stow him under the anchor desk. We'll show a more human side of Dan Rather tonight.
Last week it was a whistle blower; this week it's a snake in the grass.
Revenue, Brian. Scaling was the 2015 goal.
I said it was ok to offer constructive criticism, not constrictive.
The new sushi place may be cheap but....
You must be the new campaign manager. Welcome to the Trump campaign.
Legal is through the second door on the right.
Take your serpent to work day is tomorrow.
The trans-reptile restroom is occupied.
Not quite what I expected for my retirement gift.
Just let it slither back under the MBA program it came from.
Maybe 'Bring Your Snake or Daughter to Work' Day should be two different days.
I said red tiles, not reptiles.
Into the boardroom. We're doing salary negotiations.
Just what this company needs, another cold-blooded snake.
I think the boss wanted giant STEAKS.
Just leave it coiled under my boss's desk.
They say he's a killer litigator.
Pay him scale.
We need to scale back around here.
Excellent. Our marketing research shows that the American public will buy all of the snake oil we can produce.
Now who did he swallow?
It was out on the ledge, it's a vindow viper.
I don't think that's what the boss meant when he told us to scale up the project.
The birthday piñata's are getting weirder with each office party.
I'm not sure if the discount sushi is worth the savings.
Bring your pet to work day is getting out of hand.
Our numbers show we're down 98% in customer service complaints since Phil here joined the team
Why does it always have to be about Eve?!
Herbert,you gotta read the whole email.
it's too soon to bring in legal!
Just put it with the bigger one.
Absolutely not! Who do you suppose will have to feed and walk him after you get tired of him?
Bring him down to the legal department with the rest of them.
Big snack, I said I was in the mood for a big snack.
I knew we shouldn't have adopted a don't asp don't tell policy.
I don't know what's a paradigm either, but I'm pretty sure it's something else.
Give him a desk in mortgage foreclosures.
No, I said that I would treat you guys to a shake.
Pete could really use a sick day.
When I said bring me the snake in the grass I was talking about Johnson on the 2nd floor!
Just put it in the corner, by the other one.
Remember when being a pet-friendly workplace was a good recruiting tool?
Take it back; it belongs in next week's contest.
He's got a reputation for being cold-blooded.
Have you seen the office cat?
I have the pink slips. We're ready.
You must be the legal team.
You're taking the boss out to lunch?
We're obligated to give you cobra with your severance.
Caught another auditor.
Not my problem; I’m Human Resources.
O'Donnell in accounting is next for "early retirement."
Take him to "Sales."
Another motivational sales meeting,I presume.
Oooh, I see the judge for the New Yorker Caption Contest has decided to stop by.
Okay guys, you snake oil salesmen still have to comply with the dress code.
Hiring had something slightly different in mind when they asked whether you knew python .
Next time, I will just call a plumber.
I think maybe we could start him in sales.
Oh good, the auditor is here.
"Mr. Trump said he wanted to "convict her", not a "constrictor".
Toilet's clogged again?
Sorry, we already have a campaign spokesperson.
Why didn't you just call a plumber?
We're bringing on ANOTHER lawyer?
Yes, I'm sure he said he likes big asps
At the very least you're going to have trust issues.
We need to rewrite the job description.
I guess we should have set his computer up with a trackpad, not a mouse.
Enough is enough! I have had it with these Motherf...ing snakes in this Motherf...ing office
The boss wanted a big deal not a big eel.
So that's how they plan to squeeze out more profit!
Oh, no.... I meant Ana Conda......in Accounting!!!!
The rest of the board is in the conference room already.
we needed someone who speaks with a forked tongue
Legal is down the hall on the right.
Yes it's big, but does it have legs?
Danny caught this while fishing in the stream outside the old nuclear plant.
Well, well, well… I see the two of you are still trying to beat the rat race.
The IRS guy is in room 12.
We're being audited.
Hello Mr. Trump
Try the hostile take-over meeting in 102.
I'm not sure the new mascot is consistent with our branding.
You can tell it's an election year. - forked tounges everywhere.
Looks like he needs a pit to hiss in.
I see you've met out downsizing consultant.
Steve just acquired another one of our competitors.
Now that we don't have to lick stamps anymore, I think you can just let old Ethel go, into the woods out back.
He'll fit in with our legal department.
I meant a plumber with a big snake
Tempura...sushi...spicy tuna roll...who ordered the eel?
I guess that explains what happened to Arlene's comfort poodle.
This is why we have a no pet policy.
Just got promoted. He is the brains behind the EpiPen price hike.
Tell the boss her lawyer's here.
Christ Roberts I said get a large cake
Bring it straight to the negotiating room.
Just for fun, throw it in the typing pool
Throw him in the back with the others.
That reminds me. I have an appointment with legal in an hour.
Glad to see you boys helping Johnson unwind.
I am not comfortable with HR's passive-aggressive approach to mandatory retirement.
Sit him down at that desk over there, keep him away from my mouse.
Check Dawson's desk, I think I recognize the suspenders.
Pokemon Go has really upped its game.
Put him in the back room with the other lawyers.
Yeah, it's just another hissing fit . . . we've got it under control.
Meet the new head of HR.
Get some coffee in him fast, his acceptance speech is in 5 minutes!!
It's time to talk about the elephant in the room.
Research has shown that a pet in the work place increases productivity.
I warned you about his huge hissy fits.
You got it from Amazon primal?
You dimwits! I wanted a big SHAKE.
Only three more days until the new hole punch arrives
"I suddenly regret creating "Bring your pet to work" day.
We should run this past legal.
Perhaps we'd better let the plumber snake the toilet?
It creeps me out when Larry orders the Unagi Supreme.
I hope you're not bringing that on the plane!
Oh, great, the new HR Manager has finally arrived.
His credentials were too good to pass up
But is it kosher?
The new hire in Legal?
The anger management seminar is in Conference Room B.
Boss changed her mind, she's going with the, "Elephant in the weeds" instead.
Shake Up fellas...I said we needed a Shake Up.
I meant install Python, the coding programme!
Perhaps we should temporarily suspend our child care program.
This is our third C.E.O. this year.
This isn't what I had in mind when I told you to learn Python.
He will fit in well with our legal team
It filed a harassment suit. HR says it stays.
Take her home. We caught the company mole.
He's the new expert on long positions.
Looks like the recruiters have been casting a wider net lately.
There may be some lingering resentment.
Good, and after he licks the envelopes, get an elephant for stamping.
I hope you didn't forget my fries.
I see you've met my Emotional Support Serpent.
Didn't I ask for a large shake?
New attorneys' offices down the hall.
On top one day, escorted out the next.
I see we have another Senator on the payroll.
Glad to see a two-pronged approach on the account.
No, it's a meeting for the company's largest stakeholders!
We found the spineless slitherer who's been spewing venom about us on sssocial media.
No, I said, 'an accountant'.
He says he's got backbone, but I just don't see it.
This is Wallstreet, only two-legged, cold blooded creatures allowed here!
I see we'll need to fine tune the "Bring Your Pet to Work Day" guidelines yet again, gentlemen.
Another escapee from Trump Tower?
Legal department is downstairs.
Well let's say when I heard the new head of marketing was a snake, I assumed it was a manner of speech.
Legal is on Floor 9.
Tell him he starts today but,keep him away from the desk where the rabbit is working!
You must be the transfers from our Everglades office.
Please show the new CEO to his office.
Just park it in the boardroom, next to the corporate ladder.
Umm, I meant python the programming language!
Oh thank god, so the copier is fixed?
Same price as the foot long?
Downsizing again?
Set him up in the customer service department.
Dawson made his numbers? Good, now squeeze a few more sales out of Jenkins.
I’m starting to re-think the ‘bring your pet to work day’.
Looks like a revisit of 'Bring your pet to work day' guidelines is in order.
You might want to run that past the boss.
Hey guys, taking the boss out for lunch?
I know it was your pet project but it had to go.
Take him over to sales.
Just put it in the attorney's office, they will get along fine
I think Liz said she wanted fun "and a Conga" for her retirement party.
We start coding with Python today.
Make sure he has a valid Green Card then assign him to security.
Get him upstairs. Accounting just asked for a new adder.
Marketing says that he skews a little TOO freudian.
Are you sure this is really virus protection?
Yeah, but does what you're proposing have legs?
Do you know who kept hissing during my presentation?
I said I needed a snake for the toilet!
Mr. Trump still prefers the GOP Elephant as his description!
For the next part of the team-building exercise, bring it back to the Everglades and release it.
He's here for the ethics training.
I said to get a massive cake...
Why can't we have a normal mascot like other newspapers?
It doesn't meet criteria for a therapy pet.
So, I'm guessing Hodges hasn't agreed to taking early retirement yet.
Put him in conference room D with the bankers.
I recommended against his campaigning in his true form, but he insists on doing everything HIS way.
We should let IT hire the Python developer next time.
Let's set it loose in HR first and legal after.
No, I would NOT like to join your Anna Conga line
Ummmm....I meant for the clogged sink.
He's from Legal....he got lost,
Now we can show them exactly where we get the oil.
Probably should have checked references first.
You say you've made progress in locating the computer worm?
Isn't that rather harsh treatment for the guy who wrote "less people" instead of "fewer people?"
I see you two have met the new public relations manager.
New house counsel?
You're sure the boss loves pranks?
The board said we need to find new innovative ways to squeeze out the competition.
I'll see most of you at the All-Hands meeting later.
He says, “Go with the Apple.
Cleanup at the Clinton foundation.
Rats and fresh coffee in the dayroom.
I see the Amazon acquisition is going smoothly.
I guess we can stop blaming Bill for the backups.
No, no. Financial wants a constrictor.
I see you've met our new attorney. Put him in Johnson's old office.
You sales guys are cold-blooded. Have I ever told you that?
Show him to the conference room. He's here for the deposition.
Did your customer accept the apple?
It was a metaphor! The CEO has to be a human...
It's not what it looks like.
Take him to Legal. He's not an invasive species there.
No! I said I wanted a snack.
It looks smaller on my Pokemon GO
He's a cold blooded sales machine
He gets the corner office. He's the bosses nephew.
When the boss said, "do whatever it takes to win this case", I think he was thinking more along the lines of jury tampering.
He doesn't look like a team player.
Caught Fred in the water cooler again,eh?
We should be mouse-free by Monday.
'Predatory lending' is just a saying.
I didn't know we were relocating HR.
I'm starting to regret approving Take Your Pet to Work Day.
If you just learned to walk upright, you could cut your staff by 50%
Take it back...turns out they said to bring a DEAL to the table...
No, we already have enough forked tongues in Marketing. Try Customer Service.
I'm pretty sure he wanted the Repp file, not reptile.
No, I meant a plumber's snake.
We're not *that* pet-friendly.
Snakes and corporate ladders?
So, last week it was your service dog?
He gets the corner cubicle with the aquarium.
Place the boa on the corner rack right next to the sequined gowns.
I know it ate the receptionist, but it's a service animal.
You are being sued by Adam and Eve who claim that they lost everything after following your advice.
This is not what I meant when I said we needed to promote diversity in the workplace.
I think you guys carried the team-building exercise a little far.
Yes, Mr. Trump ordered the fresh sushi.
Well, Governor Pence, do you think you can carry him all the way to the White House?
Not now...he's having a hissyfit
Hurry! His other advisers are already in the conference room.
How are you gonna get that thing in her pencil drawer?
Well, sir, we are taking Bob's comfort animal to him.
We can't let the voters know the candidate's real identity.
No more clogged toilet, sir.
I see you've met our new Compliance Officer
Bill, I really think this is a disproportionate retaliation for Tom eating your chips.
Put it in Bob's office. The cage won't be arriving till Thursday.
You fools, all our competitor needs to do is get a big mongoose!
That'll never fly.
So….Malware is literally a worm?
Wow, that's really cold-blooded!
Hold on! Don't you remember what happened last time you flushed one down the toilet?
I don't care if he's inside a lizard. I need Jenkins at that meeting!
Just what we need--another viper in the office.
If that doesn't solve our mouse problem, nothing will.
So the new guy in Legal isn't working out, I take it?
He's here for the interview for campaign manager.
I think we've gone too far with some of these team building activities.
This message from the CEO says that the meeting is canceled. She never wants to see that lying snake again.
When you're finished with him take him back to marketing.
Miss Coulter, you're on in five.
He's on a strict diet of corporate sheep and unhireable interns.
Bathroom got clogged again?
Congratulations on winning the race to the bottom.
Thanks for taking our new attorney out to lunch, fellas.
Blame spellcheck. I meant to write "I need a new monitor" and it changed it to "big scary python."
Careful boys, don't let anyone see Mr Trump without his wig on
When I asked you to "land the big one" I was referring to the Shyzdrek contract.
Introduce the new guy to the rest of the sales staff.
I thought we weren't scaling up until Q4
You know the rules gentlemen, even our snake handlers are required to wear coats and ties.
That item on your to-do list was actually an aconym for Employee Engament Lecture.
put it back into the Pokemon Go tank
Viewership is down; release the sea serpent into the sewer system.
That's not what I meant by 'Bring back a live one'.
Not macro fish you idiots . . . he said micro fiche!
I was wrong. Let me say, categorically, we have no rodent problem whatsoever!
Rats in the lunch room again?
Have you guys seen my mouse?
Hang on... Legal is on the 12th floor.
Ok, let's see...I believe his office will be between Ailes' and Bannon's.
Did you check his references?
You say Equal Employment Opportunity...I say SASHIMI!
Good morning, sir.
Larry, Scott, Kaa. I'll see you at the 3 o'clock.
Uh oh, looks like six more weeks of stagnant growth.
When I discussed increasing diversity, I had something a bit different in mind.
No, a PLUMBING snake.
No really guys. They say it's a good team-building exercise.
Nightmares? Third Floor.
OK, Harry can take a sick day.
I think you misheard me, the boss wants "a big steak."
Better tell building maintenance the snakes are back.
Can you make it molt? We need more skin in the game.
Gary, you'll have to see someone in HR if you continue to eat your coworkers.
Yeah, but we need the apple.
Toilet trouble
I guess we are scaling up.
I'm a bit concerned about the new CEO's emotional support animal.
Take him to Marketing.
Of course he speaks with one, but HR says that’s an unfair stereotype.
I said bring me your best deal.
Tell the customer no can do. After 90 days, absolutely no returns!
That's the new envelope moistener?
When I asked you to place the order, I said Amazon not the Amazon.
Um, could you just call a plumber?
That explains the hissing.
Kevin, HR wants to talk about your behavior on that plane.
Sales is the second door on the left.
Say, isn't that Finley's service serpent, and where is Finley anyway?
Snack. I asked you to bring me a snack.
The snake oil business just isn't what it used to be.
I guess we really are snake oil salesmen.
We really need to hire some women.
I know you doubt his qualifications, but he did graduate from Trump University.
I though marketing wasn't coming to this meeting.
DON'T BELIEVE A WORD HE TELLS YOU.
If Jenkins is in there, can we have him sign Cindy's birthday card before he goes?
Guys, did you forget about Nancy's snake allergy?
On second thought, perhaps I can authorize a slight pay raise.
When I said the successful candidate would need to be slippery as an eel, I was speaking metaphorically
Not the snake from marketing - bring her the one from accounting.
So long as you brought enough for everyone in the office .
Sorry, guys. Trump just hired a new campaign manager.
What the boss actually asked for was a 'servant.'
And who is bringing the ladders?
It may seem weird now, but trust me: it's way safer than bring your child to work day.
We had to kick this one out of the focus group. He ate 4 of the mice.
Excuse us, we're just escorting Mr. Trump's new advisor to his office.
We might want to rethink the team mascot idea.
Phil always morphs just before ethics training.
Looks like another case of 'What happens in Accounting stays in Accounting.'
I apologize once again, but what are the dangers of investing in derivatives?
Uhh...not what I meant when I said you need Python training.
Are you guys from the IRS?
It aptly embodies our corporate commitment to dishonesty.
It has to go! SHE ATE THE GECKO.
Aquarium, not carry him.
Wow ! Our top salesperson really is a snake!
As if this office needed another snake in the grass.
Make sure he gets the corner office in the legal department.
Are you deaf? I said "Bring me the biggest steak you can find!¨
Take him in the back he didn't finish licking the envelopes.
Sorry, but unless this eel is electric, it won't reduce our carbon footprint.
He's looking for some one with an apple.
Too much alcohol at lunch boys.
Put him in....Steve's office.
I see you've located the source of that hissing sound.
I see you've met the new senior partner.
I see Mr. Shkreli has arrived for his deposition.
Sorry, guys. The lizard Irene saw in the conference room turned out to be a Pokémon.
Hold on. I said interns are supposed to have a bigger STAKE in our operations.
This report is going to take you a while to digest.
Your idea stinks and isn't scalable.
We want viral, not invasive.
Reticulated python? No, I texted 'Bring a pen.'
Are you in there Mr. Harris? How was the trip to the Amazon?
Internal Affairs found the snake in the grass...
'Bring your Snake to Work Day' is not a thing.
I see human resources screwed up again.
It'll rattle the competition? I like it, Smith.
Glad you're here, we're totally out of those.
Your wasting our time...it says right here he won't have a leg to stand on.
The boss will be in a better mood now that it's out of his system.
I look forward to November 9th when they all go back to the Capitol.
I said I wanted to SHAKE things up.
New boss same as the old boss.
I love 'bring your pet to work' Fridays. Have either of you guys seen my cat, Mr. Tickle Dumpling?
You may have 12 foot poisonous snake but I've got this little piece of paper.
Our two-pronged strategy is too obvious.
Better hide it -- the SEC is on a fishing expedition
Her instructions: prey, eat, leave.
Yes he is a cold blooded killer, but can he close deals?
Wow, I only ordered a foot-long.
Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.
Executive retreat?
Is it me, or are we opening the Chamber of Secrets too often these days?
But you say it knows coding?
Dog! Bring your dog to work day.
Well, yes, I DID say we should crush the competition...
This should solve our rat race problem.
Quick, get him back to his penthouse before the shareholders see him!
I just don't see how he'll guard our Chamber of Secrets now that it's all digital.
So how did our clients like the zoo?
We found him out back mooching off the wifi.
put him in the office with the politicians
Escort the snake back to the legal department.
Again?
Sea monster or not, everyone complies with the dress code here, Larry.
No no I'm hungry, I said, "pick me up a big STEAK".
Time to bring out the litigator.
No! No! I said, "Move your big fat ass."
Asp? I said "killer app"!
Potluck AGAIN?
Bring Your Pet to Work Day was last week!
Guys, actually the boss wanted Anne and Wanda in the meeting.
See, we told you Bob in Accounting was a snake.
Are you guys calling me a liar or am I overly sensitive to metaphors?
Agnes in Accounting complained to H.R. again...I'm afraid it's curtains for Monty.
I see you've met our new consultant.
So THAT explains the clogged plumbing...
Now you're certain you've used one of these before.
We can try hiding it in assets, but I think we'll have to report it as a liability.
We're salesmen. We need to start outsourcing the actual extraction of the snake oil.
Put it in the fridge.
Welcome to Investor Relations.
You're gonna need a bigger boa.
I thought the annual stockholders' meeting was next month.
Is that the new H.R. director?
They go next to the sharks in accounting.
In an effort to meet budget constraints, the company decided to scale down the legal department.
When I said to give the customer a killer deal, this is not what I had in mind.
I was using a figure of speech saying to put the "squeeze" on him.
He's our analyst. He really wraps his head around a problem.
There's always a snake in the graph on Wall Street.
THAT'S our new campaign manager?
Boss says to get rid of that thing. Last time it was here, it threw a real hissy fit.
Well, he slithers outside the box, which we need more of around here...
I don't care if you are going to carrying him the whole time, he needs to have an ID badge.
No, no, you idiots! I said get me a big STEAK!
I think that's not the kind of Python the IT department requested.
So the mole's taken care of , right?
Where are all those stamps and envelopes?
I'll tell Jenkins it's going to be another long one.
Serpents prefer Apple computers.
Relax. It's a birthday present for my mother-in-law.
Always hard getting the CEO to move on after a merger.
Gentlemen! This is very eel advised!
Impressive, but your job is to manage our human resources.
Paul Ryan said that he doesn't approve of his venom, but he won't withdraw his endorsement.
Don't follow his advice if he starts talking about Apple.
Wow, I didn't think downsizing the legal department would be this difficult.
If you're looking for the Tree of Knowledge, it's two floors up.
If you ask me, I'd take it to lost and found.
Why do we keep making the same hires?
I meant the toilet snake!
You need to talk to human resources.
He's ruined take your pet to work week.
Same as last month ... extract the oil and put him in charge of sales.
Honey what are you doing here?
We've got bigger fish to fry.
You idiots, I said I want to SHAKE things up around here.
I like the initiative but I didn't realize this is what you meant when you said you had a "green" solution to our rat problem in the daycare.
No, I ordered the sandwich.
I said, "reel in the giant DEAL."
I distinctly told you to get a list of stakeholders!
Not the long tail solution I had in mind.
Oh wow, I thought you were going to call a plumber.
Put him in the grass labeled "Chief Financial Officer"
Ah yes, the new organic hole puncher.
When do the ladders arrive?
This merger might swallow us whole.
We are running dangerously low on snake oil. Get him to Marketing immediately!
Don't try to flush it.
I specifically asked for coiled.
Try not to sleep with this one.
When I told you to go out and get BOA on our team, I meant Bank of America!
I think the corporate branding department here at Amazon has gone too far.
So this is what being an Equal Opportunity Employer has come down to.
The accountants get more cold-blooded every year.
Great, the therapy snake has arrived, get him up to legal right away.
He's our new hire for the customer complaint department.
Depositions are in 206.
Said only that in his past life he was a Republican.
I'll tell the big man that his new campaign manager is here.
I see we've got something new for our Lost & Found.
No. Get the one from Legal.
I'll pass on the sushi.
Careful. That's the candidate's spirit-animal.
I thought we all understood snake oil doesn't work
I told you it doesn't work without Eve.
How badly do we want to win?
The Snake Oil account is now all yours.
It's not because you're a snake. It's because you ate Vice President Whiskers.
Was he tempting Eve in procurement again with those new Apple iMacs?
Jeez Larry, after 20 years with the company you would think they would have the decency to let you just slide out on your own...
Guess the office mascot wasn't such a great idea.
Good job. Printer's working now.
I see the diversity program has moved beyond hominids.
It was an acronym! We need Better Overhead Administration!
That's our new corporate mascot? What happened to Hoppy the Bunny?
Is THIS why my unpaid interns keep going missing?
Don't leave it in the refrigerator.
I see you're taking the boss out to lunch again.
I see the new HR director has arrived.
Not a real snake, one that practices law.
Bad news, we just learned the FDA wants to regulate snake oil now, too
Too bad--she was a darn good receptionist.
Does it have experience with industrial sinks and toilets?
Guys, the boss said he liked MONTY python.
Are you on the way out or on the way in?
The chairman specified a "new deal," not a nude eel.
I said this suit needed a large 'rep tie'.
All I'm saying: you all could have sent me an email letting me know it was Bring Your Anaconda To Work Day. Now I look like the jerk.
Is that the new CEO?
I didn't realize there was such a push on to hire endangered species.
It's our new organic, all-natural exterminator.
I think we need to revisit our 'bring your pet to work' policy......
Bring Your Pet To Work Day is tomorrow, Higgins
Good work, Jenkins. Tell the girls it's safe to get back in the typing pool.
I TOLD you to go and get me a big STEAK!
That explains the high turnover in accounting.
That's all I need, another forked tongue in this organization.
What we don't need around here is more snake oil.
The ladies asked if you could put that thing away.
How was court?
Got stuck training the new guy, eh?
When I said we needed a big snake for the clogged drain in the men's room, I think you may have misunderstood me.
I think the email asked you to bring a retirement CAKE.
Put him in the break room.
We have interns for that.
We're gonna need another CEO.
I thought we fired Ailes.
Gentlemen, are we perhaps taking our discussion about scalability a bit literally?
Does HR know whether we had key-man insurance on the gecko?
Norman is throwing a hissy fit again
You know , I was speaking figuratively about squeezing the competition .
We need to clarify the office pet policy.
Why don't you guys stop hissing and moaning and go back to work.
Put him in charge of advertising.
Put him at the empty desk in the tax department.
Hey, Chief! We figured out what happened to all of our informants!
I'm afraid the snake oil we've been selling really works.
He asked to speak with Eve in the arboretum
Just what this law firm needs.
You idiots, I said I want a big STEAK !
'He wants to buy more stock in Apple.'
Make sure our new CEO feels right at home.
That's not the 2-hole punch I had in mind.
According to current polls, this will be the best third party candidate !
Makes you wish Manafort was still in charge.
Hey, aren't you the guys who had the extra-long briefcase?
This is not what I meant by scaling back.
Take him to Sales. He's on the 'Adam & Eve' account.
No animals were harmed in the drawing of this cartoon.
Just put him over by Janet's desk for now.
I'll grab the oil and meet you in sales.
They'll soon pay when we put the squeeze on them.
They say it's this year's version of the ice bucket challenge.
Good effort, but we need a mechanical snake to fix our stopped-up toilet.
Guys, I know I said we need to take this to the next level, but did we really have to disturb our general counsel?
In hindsight, we should have called it Bring Your Non-lethal Pet to Work Day.
Actually, I told you to forget your giant mistake.
Envelope lickers are a dying breed.
Sushi again for the staff meeting?
I said bake sale.
I told you she was a snake when you hired her.
About time you got your tired asp out of here.
And here, I thought he'd fit right in...
Gentlemen, our clientele is getting a little too slimy for my taste.
The boss's office is 3 doors down on the left
I don't think a snake in the grass is a good mascot for our firm.
I'm still the only snake in a suit
Acquisitions and mergers: Robbins, first door on the left.
I think Eve's been waiting for you.
If it's Fred, I win the office pool.
You must be looking for claims.
I said pick up some SNACKS for Bob's retirement party.
Put it in the room with the ladders.
On rye after it's smoked.
And you guys feel confident this is a better solution than me licking my own stamp?
I hate basilisk Mondays.
Sorry to see Johnson called in eel today.
I see you've met our new head of HR.
His resume says he's proficient in Python.
This animal ate our work.
You know, boys, we don't need Legal for everything.
Any luck finding Eve in the garden?
Snacks. I said, "I'll get the drinks and you guys get the snacks".
Unfortunately, the time has come to constrict our budget.
Find him an office down in advertising... doesn't need to be furnished.
I knew IT would pass the buck on that mongoose problem.
So that explains why Cindy hasn't shown up for a few weeks.
New director of sssssssales?
I always knew Murphy's true colors would come out, but the forked tongue is a surprise.
Sorry guys – just because you found him in Legal, doesn’t mean you can keep him in Accounts.
That forked tongue will ensure success around here.
We're upgrading the mice at each work station.
We need to talk about Casual Fridays.
I'm sorry, but only seeing eye snakes are allowed in the office
So, it turns out Phillips really was a 'snake in the grass', after all!
Put him in the conference room with Adam and Eve, our new interns.
Sushi sale at Costco?
Thought you guys stopped drinking.
Our new corporate counsel I presume?
Well, it's cheaper than a mousetrap.
Oh, I see you two have met the new HR manager.
We found the source of your IT problem.
The executive training seminar is down the hall on the left!
Is that the same one you flushed down the toilet a couple of weeks ago?
There’s a sushi chef downstairs looking for him.
I don't think that's what the boss meant when he told us to scale up sales.
He can't type, speak, or do meetings, but he'll save us a ton in stamp moistening.
I admit, our Burmese offshoring strategy comes with its own challenges
Forget the damn snake . . . what've we got on the candidate and the apple?
No, I said, "Bring me a snack," not "a snake."
I meant find a real lawyer.
I didn't realize we actually sell their oil.
Another new Lawyer??
Oh. I thought your reference to our new client was metaphoric.
So that's the Souvenir you two got me from Rio Olympics
I knew relocating to the Everglades was a bad idea
No, I wrote construction. Construction not constriction, invest in, not ingestion. Okay, I don't remember what I wrote here. That does look like anaconda.
Don't let the boss catch you playing with your snake in the office.
I wish he'd go back to using PowerPoint.
Uh . . . I said to bring me a rare steak.
But does it scale?
I meant bring in the 'Businness Operating Agreement' to the conference room.
I know how you feel. The auditors were in my department last week.
A friend who used to work with him said he was a snake. This confirms it, I guess.
You understand that we will need a longer table for our weekly meeting.
I asked you to bring me back a snack
So, how many more are left in the pit?
I'm glad we're finally getting this thing off the ground.
I've got his resume right here, but I don't think he can type sixty words a minute.
I know IT said we had a mice problem... I just think you misunderstood.
I thought we already made the sacrifice this month?
Well, they did hesitate for a moment when I ordered sushi for 100.
I think he'd benefit from speaking to Harmon in offshore accounts.
He always reverts to type at campaign headquarters.
sorry, legal department is on the 4th floor.
"Sorry guys, I guess she said get me the biggest deal you can find".
You guys are getting a reputation as bottom-feeders.
We found her in the typing pool.
HR is upstairs.
Let me guess, this is your pet peeve.
The law department's on the 23rd floor, guys
Are you here for the stress test?
Make your own sushi day is next week.
This is not what I meant by 'more exotic food at the office parties'.
Do we have the WORST cafeteria, or what?
Finally someone around here more slimy than Mr. Ellis.
Here's the list of terminated employees.
Wouldn't it be easier just to fire Yardley?
He would have been our best lawyer if it wasn't for all the backbiting.
Lunchtime already?
Again? Put it in Pence's office this time.
At least this candidate is honest about what he is.
This is the replacement campaign manager.
He's the new VP in charge of downsizing. Put him in the corner office.
I thought he said to bring him a big 'deal,' but maybe I heard wrong.
Sorry, "legal" is one floor down.
Let's head back inside the box now.
Ahh...the new Amazon paper shredder's arrived.
The paper shredder might not be the right solution here
Nice try. I invented that power move.
You clearly misunderstood 'put the squeeze on'.
So he's is our new slippery slope analyst.
I can't wait to see what he will drag in for the next office pot luck.
At my last job, we just used solar panels.
No. I said, 'Find me an example of serpentine logic.'
Is it sushi grade?
I suddenly feel very inadequate.
Guys, guys, guys--not REAL snake oil!
Welcome to the Trump campaign.
No, I said get me a SNACK!
Looks like Bob drank his lunch again.
He needs his service pet in the conference room.
On second thought, maybe a pie chart would have worked out better.
Ah, the new legal assistants!
How do we get oil out of it?
Go right in, legal's been looking forward to your presentation.
There's no mention of trans-species limitations. The restroom is straight ahead, on your left.
I told you to keep the lawyers in the Legal department.
Good job, but the giant mixed nuts can won't be in till next week.
Is Customer Service done with the conference room?
Yeah, no need to worry, but accounting does have a few questions about your expense report.
Last week it was a horse's head. I'm not going to cave in to extortion.
Well, maybe we should rethink the mascot campaign to help our image here at the Bar Association.
No! Get the one at our law firm.
No... I said we needed to take a big STAKE in marketing.
Okay. But I asked for the Repp file.
I'm sorry, but we're really looking for someone with at least five years of constricting experience.
Ah, you must be the new social media intern.
I don't care if all the good ones were taken. That's the worst financial services mascot ever.
Bill it to 'miscellaneous'.
I see the snakes from corporate are back.
Sorry Ted, but what part of "steer clear of that witch Rhonda" didn't you understand?
No, you're not going to wriggle your way out of this situation!
Who's going to tell the boss that bring you pet to work day didn't fair well for his dachshunds?
Careful, he was just named CFO.
When I said we need a real snake to manage the campaign ...
OK, but don't make it a habit.
Carefull boys, his name is still on the letterhead.
Just getting the snakes out of the boardroom.
Will somebody get Sam a Snickers? He gets slithery when he's hungry.
Tch! This always happens with eager new recruits... What I said was get a FEEL for the office!
Yes, a forked tongue! A pre-requisite for our nominee.
I see you met the new head of HR.
Is that the snake from accounting?
Guys, the term snake pit was purely figurative
This wasn't what I had in mind for Bring Your Pet to Work Day...
When they said they were going to give some snake the old heave-ho, I thought they were speaking metaphorically.
Great work, Mr. Slithersby! Forbidden fruit sales are up 20% this month!
Is speaking with a forked tongue a job requirement here?
Place in the Auditor's office.
Ls that the rep from Amazon?
I said it was a two man stake out.
Give him the corner office.
We've out-sourced the down-sizing to a third-party constrictor.
I thought I said to scale back.
Has any of you seen my toy poodle?
We've put you in charge of reduction in force. Report to H.R.
Maybe I haven't made myself clear: Ssstop ssstealing offisssce sssuppliesss.
Paid to scale? No way!
I see corporate arrived early.
That reminds me. There are donuts in the break room.
I'll tell Ernie his ten-o'-clock is a-writhing.
The rice and nori are in the kitchen. Now get rolling!
Peterson, I warned you about going to law school.
His online application said he was a VAPER, which now I can see was a typo.
Summer interns can be so hit or miss
That explains the missing mouses!
I said "bring me a good deal"!
Carl, bring your eel to work day is NEXT Friday!
Send it back. We already have enough snakes in this office.
I see you've met the new manager.
No, you're right. I did ask for unagi.
Oh, good. I see you've already met our new CEO.
Well, no one's gonna steal your sushi from the fridge.
Can it scent inefficiencies?
quick— now put it in Jerry's coffee mug before he comes back
You're gonna need a bigger apple.
Actually, I ordered a medium rare STEAK for lunch.
Not an appropriate mascot for this firm.
Not really what I had in mind when I asked for new ways to squeeze the budget.
'Now that he has downsized the employee benefits department, does he have room for some auditors?'
Gentlemen, meet our new art critic.
What part of ‘Go to Nobu and get the nigiri’ didn’t you understand?
I said, "caption contest", not "capture contest" !
Get rid of that; the auditors are here.
Gee Whiz, I knew the computer had a virus, but the worm...?
We will continue to scale down the workforce
Our return policy is getting out of control!
No, I meant the active COBRA insurance files!
I said ASAP!
I didn't think he would literally be a snake.
Hmm, Just put it in the lunch room for now
Thought you could slide in late again unnoticed?
It's smaller than I thought it would be.
The mouse is in the storage room.
He's the new Director of Unhuman Resources.
I said bring me the corporate SEAL.
Guys, guys, guys... it's "Bring-Your-Snake-to-Work-THURSDAYS, " not Wednesdays.
Looks like we hired a new attorney
Memo from Accounting: no more bartering.
Excuse me, but is that a Service Boa Constrictor?
The IT guy has said "No" to Apple, but I'm temped to try just one.
Sorry, 'Garden of Eden' is down the hall
If anyone asks, she’s our mascot, not our retirement plan.
There has got to be a slicker way to steal electricity.
So, that is the new HR director?
Not another intern for the legal department.
We've heard you can turn this into oil and sell it.
I see you found the viper in our midst.
Uh-oh. Bring-Your-Serpent-To-Work Day is tomorrow.
So that's your solution to the rodent problem?
I was talking about the programming language.
And you get two lunch breaks per month.
Not quite what I meant by scaling down...
I didn't say bring me 'a' slimy creature, I said bring me 'that' slimy creature - Boswell, in sales.
It's Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day. Pets are next week.
Great, now I'm really rattled.
Looks like you got a huge tongue-lashing...
Has he eaten today
Tony Robbins motivation course gets more exiting each year.
That's not what I meant when I told you we needed to offer COBRA coverage.
Thank you for joining our legal team. Welcome to our floor.
He almost slipped away
Now, just as I complete our presentation and say "As you can see, we have our arms around the biggest snake oil concept in history," you walk in. They´ll never forget our pitch.
I think a simple Powerpoint would have been sufficient to illustrate our problems with economies of scale.
Seen Bob? He stepped out for a smoke.
I said that I need to add a comma, not an anaconda.
Yes, this letter did ask you to consider a COBRA coverage plan.
How's the Anaconda merger going?
OK, if anyone votes "no" for my proposal, then let loose the snake. Got it?
That's not the kind of boa I had in mind for the stag party.
You guys leaving for lunch already?
We need you to stop that rattling.
The computer reports aren't ready, because he ate the mouse?
We’ve decided to wait on the snake—we’re still trying to figure out what to do with the two giraffes and the whale.
I meant a plumber's snake - for the restroom.
Those guys in Accounting are such snak... Oh hey Bob!
Well that would explain why our rat infestation mysteriously solved itself last week.
No snacks on the trading floor!
You found it in the Daycare Center?
Are you sssssserious?
I thought I asked for a shark.
Have either of you seen the boss today?
We've hit our scales target this time, boss
It's the legal departments outreach program.
No, no, no guys... I said we need a new new app, not asp!
Route 1 to exit 22, sign for Eden. When you get to the orchard, ask the gardener' wife to sign for it.
As you requested, we've hired a new broker who better reflects company values.
No, no! I said, "bring me a Steak sandwich!"
The memo said 'snacks' in the breakroom...
Whoa, whoa! I said you could bring a SNACK to the meeting...
Did we run out of snake oil again?
It's not about the idea, but how you scale it.
Wait...isn't today pizza day?
Your mistake was looking for a mole.
Guys, I said "STEAK" sandwich!
Is it Bring Your Snake to Work Day again?
Let's put him in the cubicle next to the lab rats.
I see Jones wasn't the only snake in the office.
No, no, no. I said "Bring me the deal, not the eel."
in the spirit of Roger Ailes: "Boys, it's not the size of your snake, it's how you leverage it."
Where's Barb? I thought I said stakeholders.
I hope you brought enough A-1 Snake Sauce this time.
That's not what I meant when I said we needed to get Python into our IT department.
So now we're against nepotism?
How long before the lobby aquarium is fixed?
No! I said we need to put the BRAKES on over-spending!
The lawyers said no to show-and-tell Tuesdays.
I think you misunderstood me, I said this company needs a new feel
Thanks for the Amazon gift card.
No, I said to bring Morrie to the meeting.
Just a couple of early birds with the proverbial worm, I imagine.
Did you remember the extra wasabi?
Hey boss, it turns out that guy wasn't a rat. He was a snake!
I said, buy a plumbing snake!
The new campaign director's office is straight ahead.
I heard that you guys were supporting Trump!
Tell me you locked down the Ness account.
since we started Bring your pet to work day.we've lost 2 dags,one cat and 3 chickens
No, I wanted you to pick up a FEATHER boa for my wife's birthday
I didn't realize we were so under water.
Thanks for helping our new attorney find his desk.
'You captured Donald Trump?"
Internal audit here again?
I take it that no one has accepted HR's severance package offer?
We should have let Barney go when he was just a snake in the grass.
So are the plumbing problems getting worse?
Who ordered the Unagi?
I said get me a big steak for lunch.
You idiots. This is not the kind of snake I requested for clearing the plumbing in the bathroom.
Check in with h.r. about special dietary needs.
That's a moray, alright.
If it runs third-party, we're in trouble.
Anything reptilian goes to the government relations department.
Did he abbreviate "Bank of America" again?
The lawyer is here.
I think you guys are taking this fresh sushi kick too far.
No, I ordered the eel.
Says here we were expecting a pair of these things...
Put him in the non-gender bathroom until he sheds...
Sorry, but my CPR certification just expired about 5 minutes ago.
Comfort viper?
I did say we need to frighten the competition.
Get Mr. Trump to make-up right away. He looks awful!
I knew Johnson was a snake in the grass!
Obviously you didn't bother to read the memo about what not to bring to the meeting.
Rats!
Loch Ness is old news
I think your pitch is too aggressive.
Let's try to squeeze our client.
The new lawyer joke is here.
No," I said ,"Get the accountant,Anna Conda!
'Sorry,fellas -- Bring-your-pet-to-work-day is tomorrow.
No, damn it, I told you to haul MOREY into the office.
Must I remind you, that we have a no-gift policy.
Remember, company policy forbids long lunches...
Oh my god, NO! I said a giant cake, not a giant snake.
We need to revisit the company's Casual Friday policy.
Your replacement sir!
People just don’t appreciate a good practical joke anymore.
Send the survivors to Conference Room B.
He'll be finished with Jeff in time for the board meeting.
I'm not sure this is what she meant by "animating your data presentation".
Hey guys, "Tread Upon" claims go to the fourth floor.
Ah, yes. Deliver the snake to the office of the Vice President-who-must-not-be-named.
team meeting in 5, lose the fish
Ummm, legal is on the second floor.
I always heard your boss could be a real snake.
I specifically asked for a ladder.
First office on the left, for the New Yorker cartoonist.
Well, I guess she's better than Trump...
Updating Python again?
It's about time someone got their hands on that snake in accounting.
We'll make him "of counsel".
Head straight to compliance.
I wrote that I wanted a Poisson distribution...
Is that the new applicant for legal?
That is not an excuse for not wearing your jackets in the office.
I think that's the adder they have been looking for in accounting.
We've got to hire a new cleaning lady.
When I said get that snake out of here I meant the lawyer... Go put Leon back in his office...
Sushi for lunch?
He's fired, and exactly how did he sexually harass Ms. Gordy?
I appreciate the accounting department's team spirit, but let's call some real plumbers.
They'll be an opening for partner I guess
...but we ordered it WITH the bun.
I told you their sushi was fresh
You forgot the wasabi again, didn't you?
Take him down to Legal Affairs, he's the new hire.
He'll never wiggle out of this one. He hasn't got a let to stand on.
Talk about cold-blooded in the workplace!
Don't look at me. I ordered a jumbo milk shake.
I said " a large pie, Tom"
Snail mail or Email only. No compromise. Take the eel back.
No no. I asked you to retrieve EEL - the Employee Evaluation List
And I thought our last boss was venomous.
I don't think that's what he meant by 'find the snake in the office'
Donald said he caught it with a paper clip.
Just let him down I am going to get rid of the Mole in this office once and for all.
They're downsizing the koi pond too?
I am having second thoughts about this zoo merger.
Didn't you get the email? 'Take-your-boa-constrictor-to-work' day is TOMORROW!
" I see you've gone quite far back in the archives ".
Old Nessie is having trouble at home. Told him he could crash with us until he finds his feet.
The corporate lawyer is needed in conference room 4.
OK, let's run it up the flagpole and see who salutes.
Paging Dr. Freud.
No need to tell security about the office party.
Mr. Wiggles, I presume.
Uhm, guys, thats not sushi.
Thanksss for the promotion bossss
Sir, he said to pick the Apple but we only have PCs.
What do you mean this is the new Epi-Pen?
Great work. Now put it in Johnson's cubicle. If he quits before noon, you'll get his job.
After losing the bet, I thought we agreed I'd wear a feather boa around my neck?
Perfect timing. He just went in the third stall.
Good morning Sir. After you're finished in Hair and Makeup, we have your coffee and Mr. Priebus waiting for you in your office.
I see your 10:00 o'clock has arrived!
Well, that will make a "striking" powerpoint presentation.
So that's what was clogging the copier !
We already jumped the shark.
It's for the corporate retreat--we're playing 'Snakes and Ladders' to see who gets promoted.
Darrin, the clients are waiting for you!! Where's Mr. Tate?
Bring Your Pet to Work Day is tomorrow.
That won't work. Only a live snake can apply for the CFO position.
Yee Haa! Take-out sashimi for the whole office.
Bold thinking, boys, but a hundred and twelve batteries?
No, I ordered the pastrami.
You make a wonderful couple, but this "bring-your-pet-to-work-day" has gone too far.
It's okay, Morrie. I felt like a fish out of water my first day, too.
We lost another one to team-building.
When I said, "Fresh Sushi", this was NOT what I had in mind.
Com'on, guys. It's the new guy's first day.
Don't tell me, he ate another accountant. Well, pull him out and file a worker's comp claim.
Well, you can tell the boss we have a message for him too.
Recruiting poached from Amazon as requested sir
This is not what I meant when I said we need to shake up our Monday morning meetings
I said a pithy presentation, not a python presentation.
We only allow service snakes in this office.
Where do you want us to loch Nessie?
Now, squeeze more out of our customers.
The snake we need is for the clogged drain!
You guys really need to learn to take things less literally.
Put him in forbidden fruit sales
No one beats you guys when it comes to novel birthday cakes.
I know a good salesman when I see one. Let's interview in conference Room A.
You guys scared me... I thought that was my ex-wife's lawyer!
What is the genesis of this?
Pet Day problem finito, Boss.
Meet Wanda. The property management's answer to rising pest control costs.
Yes,I said fresh sushi,but....
Says here he's the new head of HR. I'd say it's time to update that LinkedIn profile.
No more catching Pokémon on company time.
Now remember, don't come in until you hear me say, "My anaconda don't want none unless you got funds, hun."
I've had it with these motherf@$!$@ snakes on my motherf@%#!*# campaign.
Third party candidate, sure, why not.
I'll miss the Finance Department.
If that's for me, you two are lousy at surprises.
Collections? To the right.
Good - maybe now Edwards will get out of that rabbit's costume and get back to work.
Not what I had in mind when I said we'd strangle the competition...
Tempting!
Fairly sure that's not what the boss meant when she told you guys to think outside the box.
These tax codes are getting harder and harder to understand.
Jim and Steve felt it necessary to resort to a visual aid to demonstrate their level of trust in the team leader.
I said : "Bring in a big deal"!
Even if he is well-mannered, you still should have spell checked the part about "qualified civil servants."
I see the diversity training is working.
I asked you to pick up a birthday CAKE.
I called corporate. Just put him in the grass.
That thing doesn't belong here! Take it right up to the executive suite.
Gentlemen, I think the Monday sushi special has run its course.
To be clear, your termination was not a result of you refusing to identify with a gender.
Sushi for Today's Lunch & Learn
Yes, I know he's a snake; that's why he was promoted. Take him up to his new top floor office.
But I asked for a lawyer!
This was sent from a dissatisfied customer who accused us of "speaking with a forked tongue"
On second thought, I'm not comfortable working in Python.
Umm, we need to reconsider "Bring Your Pet to Work Day"
Oh, I see you got the memo.
Bring Your Pet to Work Day is NEXT Friday.
That goes to the arbitration room.
Try to be more subtle. The interns' parents are starting to ask questions.
By the snake, I meant Jim...
What's that guy's name in the Mail Room?
Under "S" for "snake" with a cross reference under "R" for "reptile."
Wait! Did it get a chance to bite Mallory?
Big plumbing problem?
The audit is in the conference room.
Put that thing down and find out where our interns disappeared to!
Sales meeting over?
You've been sss-served.
I asked for somebody who knows [underline knows] Python.
Boss says to get The Donald into hair and makeup right now!
Is that our new tort expert?
I see the deli's expanded their menu.
Welcome, Sir. It's always nice to meet a new CEO.
We don't let the C.E.O. out of his cage until after lunch.
Throw him in the executive office. That place is a viper pit.
They don't call it The Big Apple for nothing!
Who knew snake oil would boom again.
Our research indicates the market wants more snake oil.
Yes, Mr. Chairman. Right away, sir.
When I said "We need to scale up the business", this isn't what I meant.
So you're representing Cobra, Corral & King?
I think he asked if you wanted to sell your stake in the company.
You'll be surprised at which of you interns is being kept on.
The paper jam is over there.
Guys, Frank brought in sushi for last week's staff meeting.
Great, sushi Friday! See you in the break room.
Oh, I'd heard a new CEO was being brought in.
Fine. One more week, but not in my office.
Bring me one that can stand on its own two feet.
He's looking for Apple's headquarters.
This isn't what the boss mean by 'building a better mousetrap."
We didn't literally mean we need our new CEO to be a snake.
Corner office...
Well, the interns listened, I did order unagi.
Your final interview is with Mr. Mongoose.
Good morning gentlemen, you can show Jake to his new office in sales.
This is not an ad for a civil serpent?
If I wanted you to bring me a politician, I would have asked for one.
Take him to our Legal Department !
That's one idea that I DON'T think should be outside the box!
It does seem you have exposed a snake in our midst, but I was speaking metaphorically.
I told you guys to get the boss a big "Cake" for his birthday.
We need to narrow down the applicants somehow.
Do you think you can just slither in here any time you feel like it?
Did he pass the background check?
I don't care if he's exhausted from leading the forked-tongue strategy. It's working and we need to keep scaling up.
Now, that's an aggressive choice.
So THAT'S why they put mice in the vending machine.
Quick! Get Stanley back to research and development immediately!
And tell the zoo they get their snake back when we get paid in cash.
Is it Take-Your-Anaconda-To-Work-Day already?
He looks hungry, stick him in the manager’s office.
Meet our new expert on sliding scales.
Put him in Accounts Receivable.
Your right. He IS our last best American hope for this year's Presidential election!
Um, the boss sent you out to get new 'wipers.'
Don't forget to recycle the giant, fake can of nuts.
No, you got it wrong. The Donald said, "Bring in Sir Pence for an interview."
This place is officially a rat trap.
Believe me guys, I am certain that he said "Bring me a "DEAL" that I can't refuse."
Sales is down the hallway on your left
Not another campaign director!
Just flush it down the toilet
I recommend binding arbitration.
What did I say about pets at work.
'Go home snake, you're drunk.'
We've combined our pest control and security budgets. Besides, I'm allergic to cats.
...and human resources thought we were exaggerating.
Is it customer service training day already?
Sticking your tongue out won't make us change our minds about laying you off.
Just tell him we'll forward his resume to HR, and they will get back to him.
That looks like a white-fanged creature. This purchase order specifies Bluetooth.
This is the last time I come into work on Saturday.
He wasn't being politically correct. He ate the Boss.
The boss says he's found a new way to scare off competition.
It's his current choice to head up his campaign!
Is that a female snake? The board says the next snake must be female.
Good work men! I thought you'd find it on Hillary's server.
We think it originally belonged to Eve.
I asked you to bring me a STEAK.
There's one in the men's room too.
You guys didn't get the memo?
How in the Sam Hill could you possibly misunderstand "Assign one of the interns to feed the snake"?
Here are the Senator's revised talking points.
I see the new VP speaks with forked tongue, Kemosaba!
What do you mean this is part of our ADA compliance program?
That's not what I meant by running a snake through the pipes.
I wondered how they were going to break up the banks.
Bring your boa to work Friday is it?
I said "turpentine!"
This is Miss Hissy from the secretarial pool.
Do not hire that sorcerer again for office parties.
Don't be such an asp about it.
Bring your eel to work was last week
I came to sign the deal, not an eel.
"He gets the corner office".
Our new Vice-President of Acquisitions--Monty Something.
Oh no, not another 'power lunch'
I said I plan to tell the shareholders this afternoon that I have the largest stake in this company.
We're scaling down our business
Is that one of those Pokemon thingies?
I see you've found the problem!
That must be the new customer service manager.
Are you sure he's the best stock picker you can find for our hedge fund?
Is he friendly?
I'm not sure performing 'Anaconda' is the best choice for the office talent show.
No one else is voting Trump?
Impressive. Does your congregation speak in tongues as well?
Why the long snake?
Bring him straight to the debate room.
Quick, get Mr. Trump into his office before the press see him.
The boss says his baby goat is missing.
That's for his retirement party? I would have chosen a barracuda!
Just make sure Legal doesn't see it.
We may have solved the mystery of the disappearance of that clerical in cubical 16.
I know it works for Loch Ness, but surely there's a better way to raise our profile.
Obviously, you don't understand the 'Bring your Pet to work day' concept.
What did I tell you guys about bartering?
The ol' snake in the can gag! You guys in Creative crack me up
No! I asked for a large steak.
This must be the applicant from the monster posting.
No,I said I wanted to see Beau Strichter. He's in accounting.
Secret Santa is less fun since we let the lawyers in.
....first time I've ever seen a winner of the primaries looking THIS bad....
Now we may be able to get rid of all those mice.
It doesn't take a trade school graduate to know what a plumber's snake is !
Sorry guys, the CEO has changed his mind. Turns out a giant leech is not a good symbol for a financial services company.
Slytherins, room 3.
Oh I forgot, it's take your pet to work day.
Look I said Trump polls as a snake-oil salesman, but I didn't say we were doing live testing!
Pet-friendly workplaces are shown to have a significant impact on employee satisfaction.
He speaks with forked tongue, but drunk is drunk!
Today's computer viruses are at a whole new level.
Put it in the kitchen. It should cut down on "extra long" coffee breaks.
Wait. What are the details of the Early Retirement package again?
You finally caught Julian Assange?
Yes, bring him to internal audit with the others.
Take him back; this campaign has enough forked tongues.
That's not what I had in mind when I asked for sushi for the whole group.
I said an electable heel !
Boss says we'll rethink the Amazon project.
Oh my, that app sure went wrong.
"The emergency defibrillator is down the hall on your left".
He got in on an H1B visa. We couldn’t find anyone who could handle an Apple as well as he can.
We may not have big hands, but we've got this.
Time to show him the door. None of his marketing campaigns ever had legs.
... pens, paper clips, staples, ASAP. Not ASP!
Another downsizing?
I said we needed a civil servant, not a sea serpent!
Is that a snake under your arm, or are you happy to see me?
They ran out of therapy dogs, but I have a feeling she'll 'boost' office morale.
Tongue lashing needed in accounting.
Change of plans; We're going to sell crude oil instead.
When I said "we'll get that snake" I didn't mean it literally! I was talking about Donaldson!
Now it's time to put the squeeze on marketing.
I told you to use Python to build the application...not to use a python!
So you guys are presenting on COBRA?
Don't let the media see that. They already think we sell snake oil.
No, I told you to order enough STEAK for everyone in the office.
First it's the wolf of wall st., now its the snake of silicon valley?
Just because I said you should check your sources I didn't mean for your to bring them in.
Molting again are we, Ed?
Wow! I always thought that was just another conspiracy theory.
Whoa, guys, I thought you knew I meant "Find me the snake in the grass" metaphorically.
Velcome vindow viper.
Tell the people in shipping to be sure to mark the package, Handle With Care
Uhhh,...I'm not even going to ask. Carry on
Welcome to the million dollar sales team - your terrarium's on the left.
No question, this will dissuade the sweet children from entering the water fountain.
I know this office is a zoo, but now you're being silly.
So that's our our new campaign manager.
Good news. The new guy in legal says he can also fix the plumbing.
Oh, and we're also going to need the Yeti, Loch Ness, and Sasquatch accounts as soon as you can wrangle them.
No! You give him mouth to mouth resuscitation.
Sheesh! I thought when the boss wrote 'eel-mail' it was just a misprint!
Clearly you two aren't plumbers.
That's not what I meant when I asked you to find the office rat.
Who are we suing?
The toilet backed up again!
Did you catch him going door-to-door again?
Sushi prep - room 4
They did say the new intern was going to be a lot to handle...
We caught him smoking in the Men's Room.
Hey, nobody told me that we could use props in our presentation!
Don't get rid of it until we find Throckmorton.
No thanks. I'm sick of sushi.
Hasn't Cooper finished clearing out his cubicle yet?
I know we are in the business of selling snake oil, but not the whole snake.
Couldn't hold your licker last night, huh fellas?
You're up to something fishy. I can smell it. But your plan is eel-conceived.
I see your candidate really does speak with a forked tongue.
We discontinued "Show and Tell" around the water cooler.
This isn’t what I meant when I said we need more backbone
I heard there was a snake in the boardroom.
I always get nervous when our lawyer visits.
A serpent? Not cold-blooded enough for our campaign.
Welcome to the Marketing Department! We were all super impressed with your Garden of Eden campaign.
No, sir, I’ve never been tempted.
Our new mascot?
I said "on accounta" not anaconda.
I know I said fresh shushi for our meeting, just not that fresh.
We found him in the office having lunch with Adam and Eve.
YOU THE GUY WITH THE MOUSE PROBLEM ?
We thought an office pet would improve morale.
There has to be a better way to get rid of our rat problem.
The new VP! Get him a rock in the sun -- quick!
The basilisk gets Manafort's old office.
Another executive at Fox bit the dust.
Thanks, men. It's the mascot for our new slogan: "the thrill of victory, the agony of no feet."
Be gentle with him. He may have made a mistake or two, but he's been a loyal employee.
So you're taking him to Legal?
No, i said find the big fissure in the corporate firewall.
Will she play nice with the furry ones?
I'm pretty sure Mr. Hutchins wanted a rare "steak", guys.
Try taking it to "Lost and Found.
Pet day is next week.
I'd help you carry that but I just washed my hands.
I said the vending machine needed more snacks!
That is not what we meant by extreme vetting.
Take it to marketing on the fourth floor; they think they're so charming.
Impressive. But I still don't think the media are going to buy a story about an e-mail eating snake.
Make sure Inhuman Resources signs off on his suspension.
Boys, I already told you we have a rule against political canvassing in the office
I meant for you to take Speaking With A Forked Tongue , figuratively
If only he wasn't so reptilian, even he could survive these allegations.
So this is your big idea to squeeze more money out of our investors!?
I'm assuming you've filled out form ES5B for your emotional support pet.
The President would like this one released along the Arizona border.
Boys! Reminder of how it would come across in a deposition transcript: 'The guys constantly took their giant snake out to proudly parade it around the workplace.'
On behalf of Fred & the team, although he still considers you friends and hopes your snake recovers, he finds your practical joke ill-timed and extremely unprofessional.
I thought we did away with hazing.
Who's getting severed today?
Did anyone order an investment banker??
Our lizard will outdo their gecco.
We're going to have to replace all of the mice again.
Whose turn is it to feed the company mascot?
Diversity hire...
Our sustainable toilet is clogged.
Tim's requested a treadmill desk wide enough for slithering.
Another campaign shakeup?
Well, I don't care if it *is* casual Friday.
It's confirmed. The cage won't be here before tomorrow.
Too late, the inspectors have left.
Have you seen the CEO's capybara?
Is this his new political advisor or was it just fired?
Tread lightly, it's election season.
Are you sure that make enough sushi for the whole office?
Why does it take two of you to do that?
He has been acting strangely since we went gluten-free in the lunchroom.
Wait! We found him in the hedge fund!
This is your new secretary boss. Her name is Anna Conda.
You asked for fresh Sushi!
Uh, Reptile Tuesday is next week.
Wilson in sales missed his quota.
He has just been hired in legal.
You'll have to hold on awhile longer. I'm completely out of stamps.
Couldn't you get one without a forked tongue?
Our new CEO is here , where should we put him?
thank you for the doctor's note for your therapy snake
I´d planned to show the shareholder conference this afternoon that we have the biggest STAKE in the corporation.
He needs a coat and tie if he is going to work here.
'Bring Your Python To Work Day' isn't until tomorrow.
I said " try and snake your way into the meeting"
You must be the budget committee.
So you two are gonna feed him, you know, like every day, right?
Our 'no shedding' policy is strictly enforced.
Looks like someone's got a case of the Mondays.
Better hurry; break room's almost out of deer.
Sssso, this is our new marketing manager?
He, unfortunately, goes with the rest of my failed attempts at team building.
Get her to make-up and remember, we are WITH HER.
We should get a trans-species washroom.
Please escort our efficiency expert to the conference room.
Hurry up! Hillary's waiting to debate the Trump stand-in.
Actually, it's culturally insensitive to refer to him as "snake." He's a"Lampropeltis getula nigrita."
You’re celebrating with a ‘conger’?
You do know it's bring your kid to work day right?
So the sound I was hearing was actually more of a buzzing.
No, No, No. Not serpents. I said bring me the head of merchants.
Did you get rid of the Mole?
I'm thinking you took "Go get that snake" a bit literally
Thanks for coming so fast. That Viper Pit was killing our HR Department.
Great catch, but I said find the office rat.
Well... this is awkward. Bob from Accounting brought in the same thrashing serpent.
Apparently it's been locked in the SEC Compliance Office since the firm opened.
You can just leave that in my inbox.
The shareholders were wondering whether we could manage this fiscal year with just one snake wrangler.
That looks worse than a phishing attack!
I asked you to get the feel of the American voter, not the eel.
This must be the new HR guy!
Oh, is it time for the Biodiversity in the Workplace training?
Hey, guys "Bring Your Pet to Work" day is next week.
They asked for transparency on Wall Street, they got it.
I know I asked you to clean out the break room refrigerator, but that's mine.
I don't care what he's promising, I'm not changing phones.
Bring him to the conference room then go get the Hyena.
This is just what we need to improve the security of our firewall.
What do you mean, I should have seen the one that got away?
Okay, just one sick day.
Let's name him Ryan Lochte.
The collaborative meeting is rescheduled for tomorrow, but I will need him for the investor meeting at 3:30
The Chinese New Year isn't until February!
True, artisanal always DOES sell better, but are we even sure snake oil is a thing?
This trading eelgorithm could make us the new Salamander Brothers.
The other vendors are in the conference room.
Go put it under Trump's desk.
Gentlemen, please escort our new HR Director to the adjoining office of CEO Voldemort.
You programmers are so literal.
He doesn't look well. Better give him some 'asp-rin'.
It's just that I think a pink slip and a constrictor is a bit too much.
I see the new manager is here. I'll clean out my desk.
'Well, it's easier to explain than layoffs'
Welcome to the Trump campaign staff.
We got your memo about the toxic workplace environment.
"I see we have found the company a new lawyer".
I'm sorry, but you guys breezing in here for the fourth Friday morning in a row with an anaconda tucked under your arms has lost all of its wow factor.
He's here for an interview. Has he been 'vetted'?
I said, "Carpe diem"; not "Seize the carp!"
Not that Fang Shui for the office.
Just drop it. I'll check with Creative.
Feeding the company mascot again?
Tell Joe's wife he's going to be home late tonight....
Is that an applicant to interview for the head of HR?
Marketing billed it, they can keep it.
He gets one more trip around. Then back to Hillary's office.
A bigger server, not serpent, you idiots.
Oil! I said oil!
Our new lawyer.
Put him in an empty office for now and tell everyone to hide their comfort pets.
Sorry gentilmen, but we've had to scale back.
We need to think of another way to downsize the legal department.
Put it next to Eve, but leave room for a very large apple.
Let me know when the boss is done digesting.
I said increase "sales" not "scales"!!!
Find out what he knows about where Adam and Eve disappeared to....
We thought it was "Bring your pet to work day!"
Guess we won't be needing it after all.
Well, that’s one way to put the squeeze on
Sorry guys, the new boss said the lunchtime snake fighting on the loading dock has gotta go.
So this is the guy who spoke with a forked tongue
Auto-correct strikes again... I meant to say, get the office a big snack.
Thanks, but that's not the kind of boa I need for the precinct costume party.
You can forget promotion, Butterworth, if your pet keeps eating everyone else’s on “Bring Your Pet to Work Day”
Two-foot steak. Steak. And where's Billy?
Gary's run up the corporate ladder had been great while it lasted.
The grass is ready in Conference Room C.
You have the right to remain ssssssssssssilent.
OK, I'll predict it right now: we're not winning the Chinese New Year Dragon contest.
That's not going to help our image.
Escort him out. We have enough snakes on the payroll already.
May I remind you two that we aim to be a viperless office by the end of this quarter?
We've had complaints. Can't use the break room microwave anymore.
Did the File Cabinet of Secrets open again?
Your underground source?
So… is the 40-foot serpentine sea-monster not working out?
The boss just can't take a joke!
I SAID BRING ME A BIG LADDER!
We found him in Trump's office, writing his speeches. He also told Adam and Eve to eat the apple.
Is it electric?
Is this the new turnaround manager?
We're putting him in charge of advertising.
I can't believe we went to Harvard for this.
No no, I said I would like to have a Pie-A-Thon.
Never mind. I won't have time for lunch today.
Sorry. The serpent whisperer is out today.
So, the interns weren't quitting?
I'm positive I said snack, not snake.
I guess I'm not the biggest snake here anymore.
I received a note saying you found a virus on your computer.
Guys, I think we need to re-think our perceived strangle-hold on our clients.
Jackets are to be worn at all times.
Um, Tony - I didn't mean "show me your snake" literally.
This hunt for diverse hires is going to be the end of us.
No, we're selling snake oil.
I've seen worse snakes around here.
Take him to our collections division on the second floor, they've been expecting him.
If you're done with Megyn Mr. Ailes would like it back in his office.
I'm sorry but I don't think he's the right candidate for the position. He's kind of slithery.
What were the rules on bringing your pet to work day?
Basement wet again?
Now that we have elevators, you and the ladders are redundant.
We've been called to the situation room.
You'd be the new team in HR?
And how exactly is he going to help us with our spyware problem?
I'm thinking now that Mr. Long's office just might be the better destination.
He wants to run for president, and he needs someone to write his speeches.
No. The list said 'and a condom,' not anaconda.
Sorry boys, but HR refused the transfer request.
You've got a killer instinct, I like that.
This is the third time this week you've slithered in late!
Well, okay, as long as the resume clearly claims sixty words per minute.
Lab 4, next to the thankless child and man's ingratitude.
Are you two sharing lunch again?
How many canaries in the coal mine did he eat?
What's that old saying about "geeks bearing gifts"?
I told you he was a snake in the grass. Now do you believe me?
I believe he ordered steak.
So, he wants to deny any relationship with Trump too.
Couple of early birds, I see.
The lasagna in the fridge is mine, guys, so hands off...no offense, Cecil.
The CEO position has already been filled.
Guys, when I said your presentation lacks originality, this is not what I meant
Join, or Die.
Yes, I've already been introduced to our new CEO.
This is not what she meant by a large boa.
No, fellas. Murray. I said I wanted to see MUR-ray.
I told you! I don't want another snake working here.
This isn't what I envisioned for the Emotional Support Animal initiative.
We'll need a mighty big hot dog bun.
Great for show and tell, but fellas, this is the Times.
I guess we are increasing diversity in the K9 workforce
"Python" is the name of a programming language! I need you to pick THAT up on the side.
You thought a foot-long wouldn't be enough?
Hold on, ee'll be with you in a moment.
The new cafeteria chef is from China. He says they taste like chicken.
No matter that he's slippery Fred, HR just needs to know his native tongue.
Another candidate for chair of the DNC? Right this way...
HR says it's gotta be stuffed and mounted before you put it on the wall.
When the brochure promised 'Natural Rat Extermination,' I was expecting something--well--a little less slithery.
Oh great, a new legal guy.
idiots!!! my voicemail said bring a big SNACK to the party
But I brought my lunch today.
No, no, I said there was a problem with my wireless mouse.
Are you the plumbers?
Nessie has a few words to say to our gossip columnist
So it's takeaway sashimi, for the party?
It might be time to scale back on a few of our clients.
Guys, guys ! When I said "our new product is "snake oil"" I didn't mean that literally.
Just another day at the off hiss.
A Coelacanth? That's so 400 million years ago.
THERE he is.
A drug sniffing snake! It only points... right?
It's right here on his lunch order. The boss wanted a large shake!
I meant Python the programming language.
Feeling eel?
I see dead people.
No, no, you idiots, I said I wanted a snack, not a snake!
I don't care if his tongue is a divining rod, tell the genetics lab that we already have too much trouble with sexual harrassment.
We got the Anaconda Copper account?
For goodness snake!
I forgot today is Take Your Mythical Creature to Work Day.
If he suggests lunch at an all-you-can-eat buffet, don't be surprised when he plays the "I'm digesting" card.
Trump headquarters: "With a trouser snake like that they'll never make fun of his hands again!"
According to the new policy, snakes belong in marketing not business affairs.
Good work boys. This fellow has thwarted me every time I climb the corporate ladder.
The show-and-tell staff meeting is over.
I would make a penis joke but women have ruined the American workplace.
Uh, that comment was about Larry in accounting, and it wasn't meant to be taken literally.
No! I said, 'Bring me the rept file,' the one with the reports.
Hold on fellows--bad vibes, tongue flicks and hissing mean he's close to calling the election.
Again? I keep thinking thursdays are "Bring your snake to work day".
Sorry that the Heimlich method didn't save your boa constrictor.
Idiots! I said servant, not serpent!
Yes, the boss is in.
Oh, good, you're free.
Sushi again?
Sushi my ass.
I said pastrami on rye
R&D have some splaining to do.
Turns out it's a six-foot sub we need for that meeting.
So that's the break-room thief who's been taking all the employee lunches...
More oil for the sales department?
Tell Harry the Chamber of Secrets is open again.
UGH...I meant our competitor when I said "Get that big fat snake in the grass"
That was just a figure of speech.
I'll call Poison Control. Looks like the boss bit his lip again...
I have to let you know that this does bring into question the rest of your resume...
Which political campaign ad is this intended for?
Bob took some time to digest the news of his dismissal.
We acquired this critter in the merger.
You must be the new CEO.
Fine. You can have the standing desk.
I told you guys to order a feather boa . . .
Put him in with O'Donnell, he speaks with forked tongue, too.
Serpentine, Shel, serpentine!
