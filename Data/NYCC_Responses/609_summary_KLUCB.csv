4176,2484,6,16,78,100,1.28,0.056995480947921194,609,"Hurry, maybe we’ll get a sesame seat."
4963,2484,3,22,75,100,1.28,0.051404515778521266,609,They said the ride would be gluten free!
4930,2484,5,18,77,100,1.28,0.055194788218315013,609,"No, let's wait for the ""No Onion""."
4727,2484,7,14,79,100,1.28,0.05874099974042875,609,And that was the day Mankind realized that there /was/ a glitch in the matrix.
4608,2484,4,20,76,100,1.28,0.05333333333333333,609,I'd be willing to share.
4599,2484,4,20,76,100,1.28,0.05333333333333333,609,This must be a health code violation
4396,2484,6,16,78,100,1.28,0.056995480947921194,609,Can't afford a taxi? Join the club.
5192,2484,6,16,78,100,1.28,0.056995480947921194,609,"Not this one, honey. We want the one with no pickles."
6182,2484,5,18,77,100,1.28,0.055194788218315013,609,Wait for the local. The express is not gluten-free.
7680,2484,5,18,77,100,1.28,0.055194788218315013,609,Most... elaborate... pun... EVER. The MTA is really hamming it up.
6309,2484,6,16,78,100,1.28,0.056995480947921194,609,Homonym Man struck again!

8060,2484,3,22,75,100,1.28,0.051404515778521266,609,Dine here or takeout?
8038,2484,4,20,76,100,1.28,0.05333333333333333,609,That's not what I meant by double entendre.
8030,2484,6,16,78,100,1.28,0.056995480947921194,609,I guess the MTA is seriously competing with Uber Eats.
8024,2484,4,20,76,100,1.28,0.05333333333333333,609,"No, let's wait for the Deli Express."
7911,2484,6,16,78,100,1.28,0.056995480947921194,609,So that's why the fare was $5.
7869,2484,8,12,80,100,1.28,0.06043612539305653,609,That's what they call product placement!
7373,2484,2,24,74,100,1.28,0.04940044575106626,609,"Stuffed with meat, just like the last one."
7340,2484,4,20,76,100,1.28,0.05333333333333333,609,"Oh, great. The Ham and Swiss is running on the Meatball Marinara line now?"
7328,2484,2,24,74,100,1.28,0.04940044575106626,609,"I like this new delivery system, but I did order small."
7312,2484,5,18,77,100,1.28,0.055194788218315013,609,The subway car redesign is nothing short of heroic.
6231,2484,2,24,74,100,1.28,0.04940044575106626,609,"Fred, this is not infrastructure upgrade I was expecting."

7228,2484,7,14,79,100,1.28,0.05874099974042875,609,We should have said ‘Fix our Metro’.
7126,2484,3,22,75,100,1.28,0.051404515778521266,609,"I heard the contract was supposed to say fixing, not fixins."
6976,2484,3,22,75,100,1.28,0.051404515778521266,609,You wanna wait foe the Reuben?
6907,2484,7,14,79,100,1.28,0.05874099974042875,609,I thought take the B-L-T Train meant three different lines.
6892,2484,5,18,77,100,1.28,0.055194788218315013,609,Is it kicking in for you yet?
6831,2484,4,20,76,100,1.28,0.05333333333333333,609,"Wait, whose was the #14 again?"
6633,2484,5,18,77,100,1.28,0.055194788218315013,609,"I know the city made a lot of money on the Subway Sandwich sponsorship, but don't you think they agreed to a bit too much?"
6562,2484,4,20,76,100,1.28,0.05333333333333333,609,"Let's wait for the BLT, it'll be here in 5 minutes."
6503,2484,3,22,75,100,1.28,0.051404515778521266,609,I hope the salami seat is open.
6369,2484,6,16,78,100,1.28,0.056995480947921194,609,Not where you’d expect to find the Great American Hero.
6359,2484,8,12,80,100,1.28,0.06043612539305653,609,We're taking the B to the L to the T.
7264,2484,7,14,79,100,1.28,0.05874099974042875,609,I think this is the wrong station because we need to catch the ham on rye to 85th Street.
4102,2484,5,18,77,100,1.28,0.055194788218315013,609,I'll wait for the Low-cal.

3789,2484,6,16,78,100,1.28,0.056995480947921194,609,I wonder if this one’s to go?
1880,2484,5,18,77,100,1.28,0.055194788218315013,609,"Oh, so that's how it got its name."
1654,2484,1,26,73,100,1.28,0.04731156136066361,609,Smells a lot better than last week.
1631,2484,4,20,76,100,1.28,0.05333333333333333,609,"Yeah, Subway finally merged with the IRT. They project significant cost savings."
1567,2484,5,18,77,100,1.28,0.055194788218315013,609,"Well, at least it won't clog any of the system’s major arteries."
1545,2484,3,22,75,100,1.28,0.051404515778521266,609,Privatization of the system started today.
1536,2484,7,14,79,100,1.28,0.05874099974042875,609,"Let's wait for the next train, this one has onions in it."
1525,2484,5,18,77,100,1.28,0.055194788218315013,609,I'd heard they'd subbed out some of the trains.
1489,2484,4,20,76,100,1.28,0.05333333333333333,609,It looks odd but smells better than the old one.
1254,2484,6,16,78,100,1.28,0.056995480947921194,609,That must be the number 2.
1112,2484,7,14,79,100,1.28,0.05874099974042875,609,I can handle the five-dollars. It’s the furlong that gives me gas.
959,2484,4,20,76,100,1.28,0.05333333333333333,609,I guess that's why they call it the subway.
844,2484,7,14,79,100,1.28,0.05874099974042875,609,Let's take the gyro instead.

150,2484,5,18,77,100,1.28,0.055194788218315013,609,Typical readers of the New Yorker
1893,2484,5,18,77,100,1.28,0.055194788218315013,609,That's what I call raising the fare!
2038,2484,8,12,80,100,1.28,0.06043612539305653,609,When public private partnerships for infrastructure go wrong.

3682,2484,4,20,76,100,1.28,0.05333333333333333,609,Subway's ad campaigns are really getting out of hand.
3600,2484,3,22,75,100,1.28,0.051404515778521266,609,"I get the pun, but I don't like that it's a white flour bun."

3333,2484,5,18,77,100,1.28,0.055194788218315013,609,"I've heard of corporate sponsorships, but this is ridiculous."
3319,2484,5,18,77,100,1.28,0.055194788218315013,609,I think you pushed the wrong button on the elevator. This is sub-level parking.

2922,2484,3,22,75,100,1.28,0.051404515778521266,609,A BMT on the IRT? That's weird.
2222,2484,2,24,74,100,1.28,0.04940044575106626,609,It's better than a food truck.

2513,2484,6,16,78,100,1.28,0.056995480947921194,609,I read something about Subway asserting it’s trademark rights.

5177,3318,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,609,It’s the Subway weekly special.
5197,3318,2,18,68,88,1.25,0.051745902770176135,609,Looks like Pizza Rat really has his work cut out for him this time
5315,3318,2,18,68,88,1.25,0.051745902770176135,609,"Wow, I’ve heard of subway heroes but I never thought I’d literally meet one!"
5383,3318,2,18,68,88,1.25,0.051745902770176135,609,The next one has cheese.
5408,3318,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,609,Didn't you buy the gluten-free tickets?
5118,3318,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,609,"I see where they were going with this, but isn't it a SUBMARINE sandwich?"
4701,3318,5,12,71,88,1.25,0.0588331327829961,609,"""It asked for the nearest subway station""."
3911,3318,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,609,Have you realized how commercialized the MTA has become?
4375,3318,5,12,71,88,1.25,0.0588331327829961,609,"Look honey it's the New ""Subway"" Sandwich!"
4348,3318,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,609,These attempts to compete with Uber Eats are getting a bit ridiculous.
4292,3318,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,609,I didn't think the #1 line Lunch Express stopped at 79th St.
4193,3318,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,609,"ahhhhhhh.....NOW I understand why they call it ""SUBWAY""!!!"
4054,3318,6,10,72,88,1.25,0.061012871862545205,609,The next one has extra cheese. Let's wait.
3834,3318,5,12,71,88,1.25,0.0588331327829961,609,At least the “sub” part stuck.
3743,3318,1,20,67,88,1.25,0.049156946952051576,609,"I've only ever eaten one, but never ridden one."
3704,3318,5,12,71,88,1.25,0.0588331327829961,609,I guess Subway finally released its 200ft long sub...
3675,3318,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,609,Nuts. We must have just missed the meatballs.
5529,3318,5,12,71,88,1.25,0.0588331327829961,609,We must be in one of those zany New Yorker cartoons again.
3430,3318,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,609,These branding tie-ins have got to stop!
4575,3318,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,609,But I ordered the pizza.
5566,3318,4,15,73,92,1.25,0.05491817307046036,609,"Jared, are you hallucinating again?"
7142,3318,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,609,It runs on bio-fuel...Hellman's.
5708,3318,7,8,73,88,1.25,0.0631173791658769,609,"Malbec? No, I think a cab would be much better."
3398,3318,6,10,72,88,1.25,0.061012871862545205,609,Maybe we catch the train at the sandwich shop.
8142,3318,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,609,Is this what you meant by 'taking a subway at lunch hour'?
8127,3318,2,18,68,88,1.25,0.051745902770176135,609,It's the local. And so we call it a hero.
7822,3318,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,609,"Well, she did say it was a hole in the wall."
7809,3318,2,18,68,88,1.25,0.051745902770176135,609,It's got to be the B.M.T.
7704,3318,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,609,I see something.
7659,3318,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,609,"It promised an affordable immersive dining experience, but I’m not so sure."
7598,3318,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,609,Let's wait for the Coney Island.
7502,3318,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,609,I told you we shouldn't have eaten that salami from the street vendor.
7497,3318,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,609,It's a 7-grain and full. We'll wait for the 9.
7365,3318,2,18,68,88,1.25,0.051745902770176135,609,"Oh Hell No! We missed the Subway, what a bunch of Boloney!"
5657,3318,6,10,72,88,1.25,0.061012871862545205,609,"'tis neither man nor beast, but it will get you uptown in 20 minutes"
7079,3318,5,12,71,88,1.25,0.0588331327829961,609,"You want to take he J, the M, or the BLT?"
7041,3318,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,609,Now we're running late. You should have asked for ketchup.
6926,3318,5,12,71,88,1.25,0.0588331327829961,609,"It's on time, so it must be a mirage."
6788,3318,2,18,68,88,1.25,0.051745902770176135,609,"Remember Honey, no eating on the train."
6759,3318,6,10,72,88,1.25,0.061012871862545205,609,"Due to construction , service on the B-L-T lines is suspended."
6686,3318,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,609,"Wait, were we to take the literal or figurative train?"
6684,3318,5,12,71,88,1.25,0.0588331327829961,609,And so our couple discovered the synergy that completed the Second Ave SubwayTM.
6657,3318,5,12,71,88,1.25,0.0588331327829961,609,"If it's not kosher, we'll have to wait for the next sandwich."
6610,3318,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,609,They're trying to make the IRT more palatable.
6557,3318,1,20,67,88,1.25,0.049156946952051576,609,I miss the simpler days of Pizza Rat.
5836,3318,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,609,Ciabatta be fast today or I am going to be late for work.
5780,3318,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,609,Apparently it's a Russian submarine.
7067,3318,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,609,It's the new Baker line.
3298,3318,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,609,Since when can you eat on the subway?
2302,3318,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,609,I always thought it was short for submarine.
3241,3318,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,609,"I was expecting a limo, not a sub."
1257,3318,5,12,71,88,1.25,0.0588331327829961,609,Is this what the President rides on?
1197,3318,2,18,68,88,1.25,0.051745902770176135,609,"I hate the MTA. You wait for twenty minutes for a local, and all that comes are veggies."
1176,3318,6,10,72,88,1.25,0.061012871862545205,609,No honey. The 9:04 hoagie doesn’t stop at midtown. We’ll have to wait for the hero.
1160,3318,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,609,"Funny, I thought the graffiti would be less appetizing."
1006,3318,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,609,"Let's take the express, the local looks a little stale!"
1001,3318,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,609,Remember what happened when you ordered the Kaiser roll in Berlin?
942,3318,2,18,68,88,1.25,0.051745902770176135,609,"It's a long ride, but we won't be hungry."
924,3318,5,12,71,88,1.25,0.0588331327829961,609,So THAT'S why they call it a Subway station!
908,3318,5,12,71,88,1.25,0.0588331327829961,609,Must be part of a new SUBWAY ad campaign.
885,3318,1,20,67,88,1.25,0.049156946952051576,609,Let’s wait for the tuna. It goes down faster.
837,3318,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,609,It’s subliminal advertising
800,3318,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,609,Shall we get a seat in the dining car?
688,3318,1,20,67,88,1.25,0.049156946952051576,609,I think that’s a trademark infringement.
686,3318,1,20,67,88,1.25,0.049156946952051576,609,Another flatbread to Flatbush!
638,3318,5,12,71,88,1.25,0.0588331327829961,609,"No David, Don't be a hero."
588,3318,5,12,71,88,1.25,0.0588331327829961,609,Can you believe it?... The fare's gone to five dollars a foot!!
556,3318,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,609,"Yes, Tim, I know it's a sub. Would you rather take a taxi cabbage?"
543,3318,6,10,72,88,1.25,0.061012871862545205,609,well its fresher and roomier than this mornings stuffed sausage
539,3318,2,18,68,88,1.25,0.051745902770176135,609,This car always has an open bottle of olive oil rolling up and down the aisle.
476,3318,2,18,68,88,1.25,0.051745902770176135,609,"That not ours, I asked for rye"

1471,3318,5,12,71,88,1.25,0.0588331327829961,609,I only take vegan rides.
1541,3318,2,18,68,88,1.25,0.051745902770176135,609,I like the Amtrak sandwiches better.
1630,3318,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,609,let's wait for a vegetarian
2561,3318,1,20,67,88,1.25,0.049156946952051576,609,"Let’s take the express—the local is too slow, and it’s always stuffed."
3163,3318,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,609,It's headed to the lower Eats Side.
3055,3318,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,609,At least it smells good
3000,3318,0,22,66,88,1.25,0.046423834544262965,609,Not exactly like the Oscar Mayer Mobile but it will do!
2959,3318,2,18,68,88,1.25,0.051745902770176135,609,"On second thought, let's skip lunch."
2954,3318,6,10,72,88,1.25,0.061012871862545205,609,Don't worry...The next one has no cheese.

2667,3318,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,609,This is taking product placement too far!
