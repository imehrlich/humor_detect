Wow, you are literally a hot mess.
No, I recommended exorcism, not exercise.
" I can only make out : ' ... is required IMMEDIATELY ' .
From the ashes, your bill will magically appear.
The good news is this disease will be named after you.
As you can see, we take patient confidentiality very seriously.
Let's handle the burning questions first.
I'm going to refer you an exorcist in your network.
Your wife said it's best if you don't know who the father is.
Actually, this time, it is as bad as it looks.
The tests do confirm you are a flaming asshole.
So the labs all come back normal, but I’d still like to get you to an exorcist.
We finally got a reply from your insurance.
Any family history of spontaneous combustion?
Damn it Jim, I’m a doctor, not an exorcist!
I think there's a good chance this'll be named for you.
I recommend plenty of liquids.
We still don't know what you have, but we're pretty sure it's biblical.
Honestly, I wouldn't even bother putting your pants back on.
We found a match
In this case, the best treatment is diet and exorcism.
Nothing that bed rest and an exorcism won't fix.
Well, it's definitely not a cold.
Looks like it's just general inflammation.
If you look closer at my degree on the wall, you'll notice it actually says infernal medicine.
Your test results are a bit alarming.
I'm sure this is just a temporary flare-up.
It's pretty clear that you haven't been taking your anti inflammatory drugs.
I can't help you. I'm referring you to an exorcist.
Sorry, Jim. Unfortunately, what happened in Vegas didn't stay in Vegas.
Have you tried exorcising?
The Priest will be here for the exorcism soon.
The results came back positive as Hell.
The good news is you're covered under your fire and casualty insurance.
Got your results back. They look like hell.
Just a guess, but are you feeling a burning sensation?
Your inflammation appears to be spreading.
Sir, you really need to see an Exorcist!
It appears to be an inflammation.
I'm not sure you'll be able to handle this.
It''s just a flare-up.
I'll be honest, it's not the best sign.
I'll prescribe an anti-inflammatory.
We take patient confidentiality very seriously here.
Your lab tests look like hell!
The good news? There's no need for a second opinion.
Unfortunately, it's a pre-extinguishing condition.
I'm referring you to an exorcist.
We take your privacy very seriously.
We've swapped 'repeal and replace' for 'crash and burn.'
Make a wish
It's giving you 10 commandments.
"Fever" is not exactly the word for it.
We can't keep giving you medicines for Bipolar Disorder every time your Exorcist is out of town!
Good news. We found a match.
When was your most recent flare-up?
well, your test results are not what I hoped for.
I'll consult an exorcist.
Eternal damnation is a pre-existing condition.
You're toast
I'd better skip straight to the bad news.
I hate the new patient records privacy procedures.
The new Trumpcare has simplified our record keeping.
I see you're still smoking.
Unfortunately the fire department is out-of-network.
So, your test results have set off a few alarms.
Actually, it's worse than it looks.
I'm afraid I have some bad news. I stored your test results on my Samsung Galaxy Note 7.
Your heart is fine, but I'm worried about your soul.
Your results appear to confirm inflammation.
It's a medical miracle. Your bill is on fire but not consumed.
Yes, I'm afraid it's flared up again
Now would be a good time for that urine sample
..and we take very seriously the privacy of your medical records.
It's chartburn. I can help you with that.
I'm afraid that was the good news.
I'm going to need a urine sample. Quickly!
Inflammation. You should see how we depict constipation.
Let's just forget we ever did that test.
This is not an attempt to win because I submitted another entry to avoid using profanity. I only want to know if minor (or major) profanity is allowed. This would have been my caption. Well, this x-ray proves it. You are a flaming asshole.
The results are in... you're a pyromaniac
I'm referring you to an exorcist.
Roast two marshmallows and call me in the morning.
Now would be a good time for that urine sample
We got your urine sample back from the lab. We found that burning sensation you complained about.
Have you visited any sites from the Old Testament in the last six months?
You sure you wore a condom?
Perhaps I should start with the good news
The inflammation appears to be spreading.
Your vital signs are good, but I'm a bit worried about you in the afterlife.
The test not only indicates that you have six months to live, it also tells us where you'll be going.
Your health is fine. It's your afterlife I'm concerned about.
Well, it's more inflamed than we thought.
Your insurance plan requires me to torch any evidence of pre-existing conditions.
I wouldn't start any long books.
Patient confidentiality is our number one priority.
Believe me, you didn't want to know.
You may experience a burning sensation...
The good news? We can definitely rule out hypothermia.
Now that I've taken down all the relevant information, patient privacy laws require that I burn your medical record.
The good news is that your asbestos level is also high.
Please don't let this worry you.
We've located a match.
Given your lab results, I'd prefer that you don't touch anything on your way out.
On the bright side, your lipids look great.
Uh, any exorcisms you didn't tell us about?
It appears your insurance has been declined.
We are committed to maintaining the privacy of patient results.
I'd say your bowel is beyond merely irritable.
You just finished paying off my mortgage.
So, you say your laser vision is acting up.
Our top priority is getting this inflammation under control.
The bad news isn't that you're dying - it's where you're headed after that.
You have one hell of a fever.
I think we're looking at a flare up.
This happens sometimes when Paul Ryan's health plan is exposed to light.
You have some inflammation.
I think we can rule out a false positive.
Our tests indicate severe inflammation.
Liar liar charts on fire
It is just acid reflux. The lab is being dramatic.
Your Healthcare plan has been programmed to self-destruct at the first sign of a serious illness, so we'll have to work fast.
I think we can just skip over the "good news" part?
The prognosis isn't good, Sir. You're going straight to hell.
Forget exercise, you need an exorcism.
Your test results show some inflammation.
Any history of spontaneous combustion in the family?
Our new privacy procedures are lo-tech.
You may want a second opinion.
Okay...THAT's not good.
No smoke. That's a good sign.
I'm going to need a urine sample. Immediately.
Your bowel syndrome isn't just irritable. It's mad as hell.
Seems they don't like your preexisting condition.
I'm afraid it's flared up again.
Your insurance company got back to us.
Your test results are in. You're going to hell.
It's probably nothing serious.
No records, no malpractice.
I can make your preexisting conditions disappear!
It's pyromania.
Your best option is a bucket list.
On the upside, you might as well quit diet & exercise.
I'm gonna need that urine sample now.
you have a bad case of chart burn
I tell you, this patient privacy stuff is really getting out of hand.
Your lab work is conclusive. All I can do is refer you to an exorcist.
Can you point out on this chart how intense the "burning sensation" is?
You're having another flare-up.
This is what happens when you bring lies about exercise and diet to my office.
Oops, I forgot to tell you your mission.
After reading this report, I'm surprised you're able to sit down.
Expect a flare-up or two.
Your lab results suggest you have an inflamation.
The test results confirm your burning sensation.
It's clear you need an anti-inflammatory.
I see your fever is off the charts.
I'm going to start you on some anti inflammatories
The results are back. You're going to Hell.
Your cholesterol levels are great but your nitroglycerides are off the chart.
Have you been experiencing any hot flashes of late?
We're converting to a paperless system.
If you don't mind, I'm going to give you the bad news quickly.
It's easier for me to just burn your bill than to deal with your insurance company
So, under Trump Care....
It's the latest revision..... the Combustible Care Act.
Apparently your insurance won't cover it.
We should treat this before it spreads.
The good news is you won't be around to see the bill.
Your test result, should you choose to accept it, ...
This report confirms it, you are a flaming a*#hole.
I'm going to refer you to an arsonist.
We just moved our records over to Snapchat.
Well...it's the Mother Of All Bills.
Obviously, we're concerned about inflammation.
And behold the bill was burning with fire, yet the bill was not consumed.
The lab report for your hemmoroids is back ...
Well, it's definitely inflamed.
The good news is that whatever you have won't last long.
This your coverage. This is your coverage on TrumpCare. Any questions?
The good news is that you won’t have to worry about the fate of Obamacare.
Ok, now if you'll just bend over for me....
It says here that, "you are currently on fire", is that correct?
Well that explains your fever.
We take patient confidentiality very seriously.
And then there's the bad news
Sorry, but all your records were on my Galaxy Note 7.
"It looks like the answer to your prayers is 'NO'".
your inflammation levels are off the chart!
Your phosphorus level is a little too high.
I think we can skip the thermometer.
The insurance company doesn't seem inclined to accept our appeal.
Apparently your insurance company disagrees with the treatment plan.
Now might be a good time to get an advance directive.
Apparently your Trumpcare insurance policy self-destructs upon implementation.
There's no cause for alarm.
Sorry, this happens now every time a new patient has a pre-existing conditon.
What we do know is that you have an inflammatory condition.
This is how we make sure no one has access to your records.
Your test results are alarming.
Under the circumstances, you might want to skip the treatment and go straight to cremation.
Trumpcare.
You have the worst case of heart burn I've ever seen!
The results from your hemorrhoid test are back.
I've seen worse.
No cause for alarm. It's our new data protection software.
According to these vitals, you seem to have a fever, at least on paper.
An inflammatory response, yes, but we need to run a few more tests.
The good news is, you might as well just keep smoking.
my prognosis is death followed by damnation
I'm afraid your clap has turned in to an applause
We'll start by eliminating all spicy foods.
Unfortunately we printed your test results from a Samsung Galaxy Note 7.
It appears your procedure exceeds your coverage
It looks like you're going straight to hell.
You'll need to take this with plenty of water.
I'd like to send you to a witch doctor.
No insurance. No money. I'm afraid that there's really nothing that i can do. However, there is this contract with the devil.
The inflammation is more serious than we thought.
It is more common than you may think in men over fifty.
Your fever is off the charts!
I've pioneered an exciting new method of hemorrhoid extraction...
It does say you need to burn more carbs.
I think I should refer you to a specialist
I don't want to extinguish all hope, BUT...
Like I tell all of my patients....What you don't know can't hurt you.
I thought you gave up the spicy foods?
The coroner is on his way.
This is your brain on Trumpcare.
Who did you say referred you?
I'm a doctor; you only need to say "burning sensation".
I'm sorry. It's chartburn.
These are the exercises I want you to do at home, but you're never gonna get around to em, so...
I'm afraid it's worse than it looks.
As you might guess, this isn't great news.
Let me go over these results quickly.
It's called TrumpCare.
Yes, it's catching.
I think it's time we address your inflammation levels.
I see here that you're suffering from a burning sensation.
Now, about your pyrokinesis . . .
This might burn.
This'll only burn for a second.
Worst case of burnout I've ever seen.
Now this may burn just a little bit.
We switched to paper because our cellular phones were exploding.
I'm sorry, it's spread to your soul.
This is why we can assure confidentiality of patient records.
There's a lot of pressure to go paperless.
You may want to tell your wife about this.
"According to your 'Explanation of Benefits', your only covered for cremation"!
Any family history of spontaneous combustion?
According to our records, your symptoms are flaring up again.
Unfortunately, this is all I can do under TrumpCare.
Another flare-up, I see.
Your Cholesterol Level is So High, It Started a Grease Fire.
I think what we're looking at is some kind of inflammation.
Your insurance company says they don't cover it.
Oops! It looks like congress just passed health care reform.
First, the good news: it no longer matters if you quit smoking.
You have a classic case of burnout.
Yes, there definitely seems to be some inflammation.
Looks like insurance will be denying this
It hurts me to tell you this.
It's either heartburn or you're the Devil.
Judging by your colonoscopy results, I'm guessing you're fond of spicy food.
Mr. Hunt, your office just sent me your medical records, but unfortunately, I thought they were kidding when they said they would self-destruct in 20 seconds. Anyway, you have Chlamydia.
Look on the bright side: test results usually aren't so clear.
I'm going to have to prescribe an anti-inflamitory!
I diagnose pyromania.
Let’s just keep an eye on it for now.
We've successfully removed your heartburn.
I imagine you'll want a second opinion.
Well Mr. Wilson, looks like a nasty case of spontaneous combustion
Your report clearly indicates Acute Inflamation .
So, you say it's a burning sensation?
Do the hemorrhoids feel like this?
If we burn this, you don't have a pre-existing condition.
I recommend an anti-inflammatory.
In a moment, you will feel a slight burning sensation.
With your pants testing positive, I’d say you’re a pathological liar.
Well, it's definitely not a cold.
I need to run more tests, but my initial diagnosis is pyromania.
I will need a list of the last five people you've been intimate with. Immediately.
I see here you didn't cut down on spicy foods.
Your health plan went from repeal and replace to incinerate.
If it's any consolation, Inflammatory Bill Disease is an extremely common condition.
It reduces my malpractice premiums.
Your health is perfect but your soul worries me.
Results are in...your gonna have to back off on the Sriracha.
This is your brain on politics
Looks like you're covered under ACA.... Oh, wait...
Usually that only happens during urination.
You're worried about side effects?
Ya... um... it's not good.
And the chili pepper eating contest? When was that?
You were right. You shouldn't have come in.
Your insurance says you can burn in hell before they’ll cover this.
Now let's test your reflexes....
The DNA test shows you to be a mix of Northern Italian, Montenegrin, and spawn of Satan.
In cases like this we like to treat fire with fire.
At least the results are conclusive, you have to be happy about that.
Your results are difficult to interpret.
On the other hand, your pyrokinesis is just fine.
I'm going to refer your case to a specialist. A priest.
How recently since you returned from Burning Man?

Let's start with the good news.
Well, we can rule out hypothermia.

This is the worst part of the job
So, YOU'RE the guy dating my receptionist.
I'm sorry, but your test results are classified.
As you see, Mr. Greene, the inflammation is worse than we expected.
I won't say it's hopeless, but I'm prescribing brimstone.
It's just my way of avoiding a malpractice suit
For malpractice insurance purposes, there will be no record of my diagnosis.
Holy Smokes!
I prescribe not watching anymore politics on TV
You're a wizard Harry!
You must have Trumpcare!
It's a new HIPAA requirement.
Side effects? Why do you ask?
The good news is you have six months to live. After that things get grim.
We could've just told your wife it was from a toilet seat.
Imagine this is your stomach lining.
Here's how heartburns works.
I'm sorry Mr. Smith, some things just won't stay in Vegas.
Right, but, medicine isn't actually a science.
Appears to be a serious inflammation.
If you're too embarrassed to say it, is THIS how it feels down there?
I am surprised you are able to sit.
I see that you were referred by a Doctor Faustus...
It looks like a case of inflammatory billing syndrome.
We're having a little trouble with your insurance.
Well, we could always get a third opinion.
Your health plan doesn't cover chartburn.
We go above and beyond HIPAA in protecting your privacy rights.
Your medical records will self-destruct in five seconds. Good luck Jim.
