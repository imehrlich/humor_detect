We also have sixteen specials that I will now tell you all about.
We also have 78 specials tonight if your interested.
If you have an hour, I can tell you about today's specials.

Would you like to take a look at our wine list?
I guess I'll have the buttered pasta

Welcome to Cheesecake Factory, sir
I am sorry, sir. We are sold out of all of your selections.
The wine list is available on your digital device. It’s an environmental issue.
Sorry, there was no room on the menu for that.
We got tired of customers not reading the fine print.
Yes, the owner of this restaurant is Claes Oldenburg!
I recommend sticking to the Small Plates section.
When I said we have a big menu, I was not talking about selections.
Did I hear you say you wanted something not on the menu?
No specials sir, just what's on the menu
Would you like to see the wine list??
Yes, sir, I'll have the crane deliver the dessert menu.
Do you have an hour to hear the specials?
We like the contrast between our large menu and our small portion size.
Sir, you asked for larger portions.
It is the GRAND PRIXE fix menu, sir
Why, yes. At one time this was a Greek diner. Why do you ask?
Yes sir, the big salad is a very fine choice.
We pride ourselves on taking tall orders
Would you like to start with a small appetizer?
Would you care to hear our specials for the evening
Our menu has changed

It's the opposite of molecular gastronomy.

Wait 'til you see our prices...
We claim the biggest menu, not the biggest variety
I see you're still on Chapter 3... Would you like a few more minutes?
Yes,we had numerous request for LARGE printed menus
Today's seafood special is giant squid.
...and yet the portions are surprisingly small.
Would you rather see the children's menu?
These are today's specials. Would you care to see our regular menu?
Yes Sir. The bill will, of course, be equally enormous.
Can I interest you in any of our specials not on the menu?
We've had a lot of complaints about the size of the print.
Tonight is gourmand night, sir
We have some additional specials tonight.
Would you like to hear our additional off-the-menu specials?
You will find the sides listed on the back, sir.
Just to be sure everybody knows you are a tourist.
Absolutely. We do provide "doggie bags".
Our daily special is Mac & Cheese.
Chef informs me that we also have curly fries...ran out of room there.
Tonight's special is the 200 ounce sirloin.
Yes, that's true. We no longer have a problem with people keeping our menu as a souvenir.
If the menu is too small, I can bring you our Trump menu.
I'm sorry, is that not what you meant by expanding the menu?
Yes, let me get you the specials menu.
Too many people were asking for a pair of cheaters.
Welcome, sir. Is this your first time at Chez Trump?
If you think that's intimidating, wait till you get your check.
Now THATis a very tall order!
No, we don't have any shrimp.
I highly recommend you try everything on the menu.
Wait until you hear the specials.
The specials of the day are...
I'm afraid the wine list does not fit through the door.
Would monsieur care to see the wide list?
The chef never knows when enough is enough
Only the fish is available tonight.
We felt the menu size should match the prices.
I'm sorry sir, we're all out of the mastodon. Would the gentleman care to try the humpback whale?
The menu is just for show, sir. We serve only mac 'n cheese.
Ladders are "a la carte."
Shall I bring you the full menu instead of the prix fixe?
You are correct Sir, we did recently expand our menu.
Ha! Ha! Yes, the check will be smaller.
It makes the check look smaller.
Wine list? You'll have to sign a waiver first.
We're out of everything but the carrot soup.
Take your time. There’s a lot to digest.
Most prefer to hear about the daily specials.
I'll have the petite filet mignon
Welcome to the new Trump Grille. Everything here is huge.
Our expanded menu offers the same selection accompanied by larger food photos.
It's our high tea menu sir
Why yes- we have an excellent assortment of small plates.

Would you prefer a kid’s menu?
I’m sorry sir. That’s tha largest we have.
Can you just give me the Kids' Menu?
May I bring you the large print menu?

Most people choose the big breakfast, sir.
I'll have the shrimp with a small salad.
Small plates, you said?
Just wait until you see the check.
Wait until you see your bill.
I'm sorry sir, you have picked the one item we are currently out of.
We're now required by law to include a full-size photo of the president along with the menu.
That is our kiddie menu!
Chef believes small menus are for small people.
Do you need a few more hours to decide?
You think that's big wait for the check!
The TIMES review about a lacking of a la carte choices is addressed.
The menus compensate for how small the plates are
And what is your wine preference—Red, White, or Insulin?
The chef last worked at a Greek diner.
Wait 'til you see the size of the shrimp cocktail!
Our portions are tiny.
We got tired of people ordering off menu.
Thank you! As you can see, we've really worked to expand our menu.
Is there a kid's menu?
The cut tonight is porterhouse. Sizes are on the left; temperatures on the right.
Amazingly so, the menu size eventually balances out with the dish size.
Down-sizing is extra.
Would you rather see our small plates menu?
And you'll find today's specials at the top of the menu.
Our specials this evening are Number 223, Number 567, and Number 712.
Sorry Sir, 'Bring Your Own Menu' is on Tuesdays.
What's this menu trying to compensate for?
I should tell you that we are out of the striped Madagascan snails tonight but we have plenty of the yellow spotted ones.
My favorite? I like everything on the menu sir.

Yes, we can provide our large print menu upon request.
That's the biggest we have, sir. May I suggest some reading glasses for your next visit?
Our manager feels that it makes the prices look smaller
Do you have a menu for this menu?
As you can see, our large menu more than justifies our prices.
Well... Can you see the menu now?
Perhaps the gentleman would prefer to see our light menu?
If Monsieur has trouble with the big words, he need only ask.
We thought a larger menu would help you ... uh ... compensate?
Tonight we are featuring a special on our 27 course menu.
The chef is quite farsighted.
Are the portions bigger as well?
You're telling me you don't have any vegan options?
I’ll have one of everything.
And what will your mistress be having, sir?
I can recommend the french fries.
And would you like that soup in a vat?
We find it makes up for the lack of choices.
Would you like to super-size that?
My wife still hasn't decided yet.
Of course, sir. I'll return for your order in a couple hours.
We had too many complaints about the small font size.
Yes but portion size is exceptionally small.
Well, no, we don't really have most of those items. It's more of a marketing gimmick!
and if you're interested in any of the appetizers, I'll grab you our complimentary ladder
It's for the hard of hearing....
Would you like a ladder to read the appetizers ?
Has Monsieur found something he likes?
Yes. The new menu is extensive. It's to compensate for, not complement, the new size of portions.
Our special is the menu.
I have the budget menu right here , sir ...
Ironically the portions are quite small.
If you think that's big, Sir, you want to see the size of the Check!
Do I have any recommendations? I would be happy to walk you through a few dozen of my favorites.
Again sir, ANYTHING you order would be quite filling.
Small plates are big here.
Would you like that jumbo, colossal, mega he-man, or yuge?
Mac and cheese? Excellent choice, sir.

Is it priced by size?
Sorry sir, but we literally serve everything BUT hot dogs.
We have some specials this evening...
Surprisingly Sir, we don't carry that wine..
Sorry, there is nothing off-menu.

Very good, sir. You want fries with that?
Those are our gluten free options, would you like to see the full menu?
I’m sorry, Sir. We’re currently out of everything but the garlic mash potatoes. Shall I get them for you?
I'll have the peanut butter and jelly.
It's because the portions are small.
We also have daily specials, sir. They're much lighter on the wrist.
But do you have any vegan options?
It's pretentious as hell, but it offers great privacy from other diners.
Our prices aren't high. They're just printed that way.
We had complaints the menu was not diversified enough.
Might I suggest the small plate menu?
Yes, but is this the full wine list?
Is sir absolutely sure he would like to see the specials board?
And have you chosen a mill for your pepper this evening?
No sir. You we do not offer half sized portions!
Have you had a chance to look over the menu?
It's to compensate for the small portions.
No, Monsieur. No substitutions.
Any specials this evening?
and may I tell you of this evening's specials...
Yes, our menu has everything you have ever eaten.
Sir, if you wish to choose to order off the menu, our chef will get very testy.
Objects in menu are smaller than they appear.
Why do you ask about portion size?
Are you ready to order, or should I come back in a few hours?
Can I have smaller menu?" "Sure, with fries?
It's in response to your comment about the chef having small hands.
Do you have any specials for tonight's dinner?
The pictures are life size.

Our special tonight is Fee-fi-fo-fum, sir
Can I see your website?
It IS big. It’s the PLATES that got small.
The chef recommends the hamburger.
I recommend the énorme filet mignon.
We have the calorie content listed for each item, as well a microscopic image of the proportionate number of fat cells forming in your body with every bite.
Our low calorie, gluten free, vegan menu is much smaller, sir.
The question you should be asking is, "what *isn't* on the menu?"
Perhaps I can help you with the menu sir?
I can suggest what LOOKS good for Instagram.
Unfortunately, our prices have increased as well.
Please allow me to scream the specials.
Would you like the wine menu as well?

Your wife called to tell us you had forgotten your reading glasses.
Oui, Monsieur. We have binoculars.
I'm sorry sir, but we are all out of the first three hundred and twenty seven items on the menu tonight.

Yes - the chef does have smallish hands.
Our lawyers insisted.
Our menu comes in Tall, Grande or Venti, depending on your reading glasses.
You know what they say: Big menu, small portions!
An excellent choice sir, although you may want to consider the petit portion.

Would that be the 8 0z. filet or the 423 oz. filet?
The petit filet? Excellent choice!
Our consultant suggested that we could increase business by expanding our menu.
Something on the lighter side please.
You don't have a locavore section, by any chance, do you?
Do you think you can handle our extensive wine list?
I'm sorry, sir, but that's not on the menu.
In addition we have home made chicken soup.
Are you ready to order, or would you like another hour with the menu?

Sir, I will be pleased to ask the chef if he can make that gluten free. We of course cannot fit everything on our menu.
Tonight, Sir, we have 472 specials.
The menu with prices is even bigger.
I'm going to have the jumbo shrimp
Can I read you the specials?
And for dessert, might I recommend the énorme four?
A little something to start you off?
In this instance, one of the appetizers is more than enough.
We hope it makes the prices seem relatively small.
It's French-Greek fusion
It's not the size of the menu that counts! It's how you use it!
we've supersized everything
Since our chef read "The Art of the Deal" everything but our petit filet is now HUGE!" Sad.
I'm sorry, sir, but that's not on the menu.
