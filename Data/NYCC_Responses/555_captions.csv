I'll never let go.
I had the tailor over for lunch.
You're the one who said I wasn't eating enough fiber.
So I stick the head up a few times, the lifeguard runs in, bingo!
You're both dummies!
... one giant leap for a mannequin.
I miss the screaming.
I call it 'A Farewell to Arms'.
I miss all the screaming and thrashing.
The dressmaker, however, was delicious.
Fake news, fake people....what's going on up there?
Nooo. I said I wanted a "man again".
Yeah, but half an hour later, you want another one.
It's not bad, but all things being equal I'd rather have gotten Steve Bannon.
I'm in the placebo group.
It was this or kale.
It needs a little dressing.
You do realize that’s just empty calories.
I see two dummies.
It needs some dressing
Just admit it. You need glasses.
The hardest part for me was getting into the department store.
It was this or kale.
Needs dressing.
They make great lifeguard bait.
Jeez Charlie, I think they got you in the placebo group!
I'll thrash it around just beyond the breakers and when the lifeguard comes out you nab him.
I tell you, Steve, it was a frenzy. Everything was at least half off.
It's not the same without the flailing.
It doesn't quite have the same texture, but it's the ethical choice.
It's like a person, but without the bitter aftertaste.
I try not to eat anything with a face.
I poke it through the surface. Shake it a bit. And bingo! Lifeguard for supper.
It's true. People have no taste.
It's Farewell to Arms and Legs.
It looked better in the window.
I think I got the placebo.
You got it all wrong. I didn't mean "go eat dummy." I meant, "Go eat... Dummy!"
They're less fattening, but I do miss the screaming.
I'll thrash around with it near the beach, you yell out "Won't some meaty lifeguard save me?"
I liked it better when I saw it in the window.
Is there someone stuck in my teeth?
I have no taste for fashion.
No, I said I wanted to eat 'a man again.'
Don't worry. It's armless.
"It needs dressing….".
I miss the struggle.
It just needs dressing.
I said bring home take out, dummy, not dummy takeout!
I don't know how long I can do this Meatless Monday thing.
Macy's went under.
This new diet is working, but I miss the thrashing and screaming at mealtime.
I hate Meatless Monday.
It's a lifeguard lure.
Do I have someone stuck in my teeth?
This completes your training. Tomorrow we'll head for the beach.
I saw it in the window and I just had to have it.
I saw it in the window and I couldn't resist
It keeps up our reputation, but no one gets hurt.
I think we should eat other people
No, thanks ... I'm a leg man.
I faint at the sight of blood.
You're right. I need glasses.
First, fake news. Now this.
What can I say, I have a taste for fashion.
Can you believe someone was throwing this out?
I saw it in the window and had to have it.
I'm doing Meatless Mondays.
You never listen! I said,I wanted a man again, not a Mannequin!
There you go again, choosing form over substance.
Don't worry. It's armless.
I Can't Believe It's Not People!
With this one you get to choose the dressing
I don't eat anything with a face.
It was a bait and switch scam.
I'd look much less stupid if the swim suit were still on.
I've developed a taste for fashion.
Let's just say the tailor won't be coming.
I'm pro-life.
I just got tired of all the yelling and screaming
Now keep in mind the real thing squirms a lot.
Do I haf fomefing in my teef?
You said you wanted it without dressing.
I ate the tailor. This is a souvenir.
Have you ever heard of bait and switch?
It's nice to have a break from all the struggle and screaming.
Fake news, Fake people. Where will it end?
My doctor says that this will help me quit.
This one has a slight woody, yet full bodied taste.
I think this one's stale.
Somehow 'mannequin-eater' just doesn't have the same panache.
It cost me an arm and a leg.
Just practicing for spring break.
It looked a lot better in the window than it tastes....
To be honest, it could use some dressing.
Spielberg reduced the budget.
Do I have something stuck in my teeth?
It's bait. I'll thrash this around on the surface, and you yell "Help! Help! I can't swim!", OK?
It's OK, I guess. but I miss the screaming.
Never thought I'd fall for the old bait and switch.
I think I'm mannequin depressive.
No, you misunderstood. I said "I bet you can't eat a man again."
I got it at the Great White Sale.
You've got something between your teeth.
It has lots of insoluble fiber, without all the screaming.
It just needs a little dressing
Of course, I miss the taste, blood curdling screams and thrashing around, but my cholesterol is way down."
Do I have something in my teeth?
First the fake crab, now this?
It never tastes as good as it looks.
They say it helps you kick the habit.
I can't stand the sight of blood.
Usually they put up more of a struggle
I saw it in the window and I just had to have it.
Just can't swim past a garage sale, can you?
I can't tell you. I've never had chicken.
It takes the edge off but it doesn't stop the cravings.
I saw it in the window and I couldn't resist

How do you think this would look in me?
They pulled the old bait-and-switch on me.
Its a dummy, dummy.
It cost me an arm and a leg.
Turns out the billowing red stream was just taffeta.
I can't wait until Lent is over.
I wondered why there wasn't much of a frenzy.
Definitely not like chicken.
It's a lot like imitation crab.
I don't care what the ads say, you can taste the difference
You know, these healthy choices are tasteless.
Just practicing. I'm spending the summer at Cape Cod.
It's the old bait and switch.
I always had a taste for fashion.
I've learned I have no taste for fashion.
You know I’m automatically attracted to the human form — I just start biting them. It’s like a magnet. I just bite. I don’t even wait. And when you're a shark, they let you do it.
One of you is a dummy...the other's a mannequin.
I'd like to thank the Academy . . .
First, I'd like to thank the Academy.
One of you is a dummy.
Needs dressing.
Mannequin-eater doesn't have the same ring.
As a matter of fact I did just read "Shark Attack for Dummies." Why?
I found thousands of these leftover from Trump's inauguration.

It was this or rice cakes.
I fell for the ol' bait and switch.
NO, STUPID, THE BOOK IS CALLED "SHARK ATTACKS FOR DUMMIES".
Macy's just went under.
It could use a little dressing.
You're the dummy.
The doctor said it might help me quit.
It's supposed to help stop the cravings.
It looked good in the window
The real ones give me gas.
If we make the drinks strong enough maybe none of our guests will notice.
Not sure about 'tastes great', but definitely 'less filling'.
You fell for the old bait and switch I see.
This appears to be the placebo.
I'd go ahead and make that ophthalmologist appointment.
It's great fun for scaring the crap out of tourists.
I'm a leg man myself.
Fine. I'll see the optometrist.
These are helping me quit.
The hard part was getting it out of the store.
It helps with the cravings, but I'd give anything for a swimmer right now.
First fake news, now fake people, this is getting ridiculous
Tastes like surfboard.
You're the dummy.
Remember, if this were real, there would be more splashing but you get the idea.
It's a bit more al dente than I like.
Won't you just gain all the weight back once you start eating real people again?

Man again? I thought you said 'mannequin'!
I think I got the placebo.
It doesn't feel the same, but they said it would help with quitting.
Pay attention! I said, "let's eat a man again".
It was either this or the patch
I saw it in the window and had to have it.
Well, that was a bust.
You know, I kinda thought it was too easy.
When does your optometrist get back from vacation?
I've been trying to quit and this is supposed to help with the cravings.
Is it me? People don't seem to have any taste anymore.
Somehow, "mannequin-eater" doesn't have quite the same cachet.
I think it needs dressing
You know that's not good for you, George. It's artificial everything.
You can absolutely taste the difference.
It's helping me quit.
It's definitely an acquired taste.
Do I need glasses? Why do you ask?
It's alternative prey.
You might want some dressing on that!
It sucks. But I've lost twelve pounds.
A bit on the al dente side, I'd say.
So, I went window shopping today.
If this doesn't work I'm going to try the patch.
My mistake, I thought it was dressed to kill.
It's helped with the craving and I've lost ten pounds!
Teething
I don't care what you say, I love her.
I'm trying to quit, they say chewing on these helps.

Excuse me do you have any Grey Poupon?
I make dresses Helen, it's what I do.
I'll set the decoy. You sneak up from behind.
Must have cost you an arm and a leg.
Please tell me you swallowed a seamstress.
It's some kind of ka-bob, but I don't like it.
You say it's not real prey; I say it's alternative prey.
Is this flotsam or jetsam? I never remember which is which.
It tastes better with dressing.
They're sending decoys.
It was bad enough when my vision went. Now I can't taste a damn thing.
Ready? I'm going to release the decoy.
I think this one's gone stale.

Not much flavor ..... but on the upside no hormones, antibiotics or sunscreen.

It looked better with clothes on.
Go ahead and laugh, but I've lost 500 pounds in two weeks and my cholesterol is waaay down.
I'm on a low-fat diet. But everything just tastes like cardboard.

Not sure how much longer I can handle Meatless Mondays.
It's like nothing I've ever tasted.
I thought you were bringing the dressing.
It's the last week of my cleanse.
They're calling them 'alternative humans'
No, it's not the same, but it's better than the patch.

Is it shark week or fashion week?
This one didn't even put up a fight!
I hate Meatless Monday.
It's to correct an overbite.

It lacks that je ne sais qua.
Sure, there's really no substitute for the real thing, but these are gluten-free!
It's for Junior. He's teething.
I couldn't just go cold turkey.
You had one job!
