I don't think he realizes the gravity of the situation.
Wait, the GPS is recalculating
Now THAT'S the road less traveled!
Thank God. For a moment there, I thought he was going to jump!
I think I will unfollow him
He doesn't seem to appreciate the gravity of his situation.
He'll have to wait for us anyway. I've got the car keys.
He may be taking the whole "road less travelled" thing too far.
He's bluffing.
I don't think Bob understands the gravity of the situation.
Recalculating...
I thought he lived in a parallel universe, but it's really perpendicular.
That's it; I'm unfollowing him as of right now!
So much for making it look like an accident.
If they turn this picture the other way, we're in trouble.
Hiking in Colorado sure has changed since legalization.
After five hours of 'Val-deri, Val-dera,' I really don't care what happens to him.
Clearly, he doesn't understand the gravity of the situation.
I'm fine with taking the long way.
Good thing this is the last item on his Bucket List.
I'm not so inclined.
Well, what's amazing to me is that he's doing it backwards!
I wonder when he's gonna look up from his phone.
Not the direction I would have gone.
I don't think he fully appreciates the gravity of the situation.
He takes everything so laterally.
I take mountaineering seriously, but he just does it on the side.
He's a great guy but he has very few followers.
If he comes back up.....THEN I'll be impressed.
I think it's the road less traveled for a reason.
Hold on it's recalculating.
He did say the last mile was all down hill.
I'm rethinking how much I want this merit badge.
He seems to have missed the gravity of the situation.
He's moonwalking into Ripley's.
Ten bucks says his hat falls off.
Why did we let him carry the lunches?
Would it kill you to ask for directions?
I don't think he appreciates the gravity of the situation.
He's got the damn beer
I think he doesn't understand the gravity of the situation.
It's the last thing on his bucket list.
"He has the car keys".
Remember when we just wanted boots to be waterproof?
Bob prefers the road less traveled.
Good thing he's blind.
So why does he need the stick?
He doesn't seem to understand the gravity of his situation
After you.
Well—what if he’s right, and gravity is ‘just another hoax’?
Siri told him it was the fastest route back to camp.
I'm not sure he understands the gravity of the situation.
That's nothing. Watch how he comes back up.
He transitions well from landscape to portrait.
Well, that explains the difficulty rating.
I'm so impressed that I don't have the heart to tell him he's going in the wrong direction.
I don't think he recognizes the gravity of his situation.
I really think he doesn't understand the gravity of the situation.
When he said there was a 90 degree turn up ahead, this isn't what I had in mind.
I don't think he understands the gravity of his situation.
I love a good cliffhanger
Whatever you do, don't wake him up.
He's taking the road less traveled.
He doesn't just talk the talk.
Those who live by the GPS will die by the GPS
I'm not falling for that.
Dad, we've been rethinking that bit about 'following in your footsteps.'
It's the last item on his bucket list.
Should we tell him about the rope?
Part lemming, part idiot.
Let's see how far he gets first.
I don’t think he understands the gravity of the situation.
If he walks back up, then I'll be impressed.
That's why its called the 'theory' of gravity.
He fails to understand the gravity of the situation.
He said it was easier than watching the debates.
No, you go next.
You should have seen him back there on the lake
He doesn't appreciate the gravity of the situation.
That's a good eight inches further than the last guy.
Remember. One with soy and one with skim.
Never tell a Cirque du Soleil performer  to take a hike.
Now that's faith in your GPS.
He's right. He's going to beat us to the car.
Hope he makes it down before he wakes up.
Do you think we should wake him up?
I prefer living on the ledge.
Well, so much for your slippery slope argument.
I never totally bought the whole Newton thing.
Just admit you took us the wrong way.
I'm sticking with the one more traveled.
How far do you think he'll get before he notices he's holding his GPS upside-down?
This is where the trail becomes technically difficult.
Alphabetically, I believe you're next.
Let's not mistake his confidence for leadership.
Apparently he doesn't realize the gravity of the situation.
He doesn't understand the gravity of the situation.
I thought this only happens in cartoons.
According to Google Maps, he’s on the fastest route.
He just doesn't understand the gravity of the situation.
I thought he was bluffing.
That's amazing. How does he keep his hat on?
He just doesn't get the gravity of the situation.
Wow. I wonder what the advanced trail looks like.
Yeah, he can walk the walk, but can he talk the talk?
He's no fun to swim with either.
Recalculating route.
Wait a second, he has the snacks!
I'm not going to fall for that.
That kind of defines the road less travelled.
He has no idea of the gravity of this situation!
Explain to me again why he can't just go behind the tree like we did.
It's tremendous what one can accomplish with sheer ignorance
Now that's what I call taking the road less traveled.
We're not falling for that routine!
You think that's impressive? Wait 'til we get to the lake.
Damn you Escher!!!
Never wake him up when he does this.
Edgar always did take the road less traveled.
Well sure, if you want to spend that much money on boots.
If anyone can get to the bottom of this, he can.
Worst guide ever.
Rookie mistake.
He doesn't believe in climate change either.
He obviously does not appreciate the gravity of the situation
Follow me. I know a slower way.
The first few steps are scary; after that it's all downhill.
He always takes the path of least resistance.
I knew we shouldn't have let Escher carry the map.
3...2....1. OK Hank, now open your eyes!
I don't care what Simon says.
I just don't have the inclination for this.
So that's what he meant when he said his shoes sucked.
He doesn't believe in global warming either.
Up to you. I'm going to take the stairs.
He must not understand the gravity of the situation.
Next time, I'll choose the guide.
When he gets to the bottom he’ll throw a rope back up to us.
There is a steep learning curve.
He says it's the last thing on his bucket list.
The first recorded descent of Mt. Velcro.
He enjoys fall hikes
He said it isn't a law, it's only a suggestion.
I just don't think he understands the gravity of the situation.
He’s wearing his Lululemmings.
I’m not falling for that again.
I don't think Frank understands the gravity of the situation.
That's gotta be tough on the knees.
We're gonna take the path more traveled by.
I wonder how far he gets before he wakes up
There must be a reason it’s less traveled.
If I said it once, I've said it a thousand times, you never ever buy a 'GPS' from a dollar store.
And don't come back.
Just wait til he finds out he left his car keys up here.
Shall we wake him up?
We knew he could talk the talk ...
He skipped orientation.
This whole time I thought he only defied logic.
Well, one of us is wrong.
He is too big to fall.
So, we're finally here: the Escher Pass.
They say his father was a Sherpa. And his mother was a goat.
He doesn't recognize the gravity of his situation
I think he's underestimating the gravity of the situation.
This is nothing. When I was a kid, we had to go downhill both ways.
Bob's opting for the road less traveled....
That's nothing. Just wait until we get to the lake.
He gives a whole new perspective to "sidewalk."
Yet, he continues to deny the affair his mother had with that gecko.
So now gravity is a hoax.
The trick is to walk VERY fast.
If he wakes up, it"s over.
That is why I don't use GPS.
His learning curve was very steep.
He's definitely going to get to Scotland before us.
Did he give you the keys to the car?
These days, confidence is more important than the facts
I don't think he knows the gravity of his situation.
Well, that's definitely the path less taken!
You know, sometimes that "different drummer" is just a bad musician.
That's why it's called Mount Velcro.
I think he just discovered the path less taken.
Bill you have the map upside down
Shhh…don't wake him up.
You follow him. I'll wait up here.
It's even more impressive that he's doing it backwards.
That's the least annoying thing he's done all day.
Wait for it...
I'm not sure he appreciates the gravity of the situation.
That was cool the first few times...now it's just irritating.
To the lemmings, he's a god.
Very impressive... but Ginger Rogers did it in high heels.
The traction is great, but they could use better arch support.
He finally went over the edge.
Apparently, he's not so inclined.
So that's why they call this Velcro Peak.
Was it unwise to pick a guide named Cliff Walker?
See!? Told you! It's the same with evolution, it's just a "theory".
It's a trick, don't fall for it.
So that's why Sam was studying his cliff notes!
I told you! He doesn't understand the gravity of the situation
If you turn the page sideways we're the brave ones
This is the last item on his bucket list.
With you does it always have to be the road less traveled?
It's not just Fred, the whole damn country's going downhill.
I don't care what Google map says.
Do you think he appreciates the gravity of his situation?
Ten to one he chickens out and turns around.
Not just anyone can take the path less travelled.
He always did take the road less traveled.
You're doing great, just don't look up!
It starts getting interesting when he wakes up.
You tell him.
He says he's scared of heights, but not of depth.
He won't change until he hits rock bottom.
He just doesn't realize the gravity of his situation.
That's the last time I use a Groupon for a sherpa.
He always takes the road less-traveled.
Vertical is the new horizontal.
Do you think he understands the gravity of his situation?
When WE were kids, we walked up and down THREE cliffs every day just to get to school!
Don't look up.
Worst trail guide ever.
This gives 'vertically challenged' a whole new meaning.
A great climber but no sense of direction.
If anyone rotates this page 90 degrees clockwise, we're in trouble.
Now, on the count of three, shout "Open your eyes!"
Looks like he's finally gone over the edge!
It's obvious, he doesn't appreciate the gravity of the situation.
No please, after you.
I wonder if Roger realizes the gravity of this situation.
I think I'll take the stairs.
Sure, he's anti-gravity. But what is he for?
Google Maps says we're just a few hundred feet away.
He always insists on taking the road less traveled.
Now there's a man who trusts his GPS.
If he's right, we're in trouble.
Wait 'til you see him walk across the lake.
I don't think that's what the ranger meant by 'head south'.
That's the path less traveled.
He has complete faith in Google maps.
I don't think he sees the gravity of the situation.
He thinks he's above the law.
He just can't admit his GPS is wrong.
He's walking up backwards! What a show off.
The brochure said "surefooted guides."
Should we tell him it's a dead end?
Just admit we should have asked for directions.
He may be short but he clearly is not vertically challenged.
Or we could just take the stairs by the boardwalk.
Five bucks says I can beat him to the bottom.
I don't think he read the Trail Guide...probably just the CliffsNotes.
He doesn't see the gravity of the situation.
Whatever you do, Frank, don't look straight ahead.
You just need to switch to landscape mode.
He insists gravity is just a theory.
Frank, you don't understand the gravity of the situation!
That trail is for very advanced hikers.
He always chooses to take the road less traveled.
Wish he'd shown us that trick on the way up.
If it's all the same to you, we'll take the path of greater resistance.
If you turn the page sideways, he's OK. We, on the other hand...
In addition to climate change he doesn't believe in gravity either.
The last thing I heard Siri say was, "In 500 feet you've reached your destination."
He said, "Gravity is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese," and off he went.
There goes that theory.
He's a Trump voter. Laws of gravity do not apply!
He just had to get in 10,000 steps today!
We'll just wait for you here, O.K.?
Phil, the path less traveled isn't always the best way to go.
If he makes it, I won't even mind losing the five bucks.
He's anti-immigration, anti-trade and anti-gravity
I don't care if he gets to Scotland before me...I'm taking the high road.
Don't wake him. That's the risky part of sleep walking.
According to Siri, we have to head south for 200 ft before we reach our destination.
Say something; he's got the lunches
When you get to the bottom, throw your shoes up here.
There's a reason why I don't completly trust Google Maps.
He thinks gravity is a myth invented by the Chinese
He said it's all down hill from here.
Don't expect us to be here when you come back!
He's going to disprove the theory of gravity, or prove the theory of natural selection.
I think I’ll take the one more traveled by.
I think you are about to see what they mean by 90 degrees of separation.
You have to admit, he does walk the talk!
Wait for it . . . any second now.
Harold doesn't really seem to appreciate the gravity of the situation
The trick is to switch your phone to landscape mode.
down is the new up
He's playing Pokémon Go again
Does he see that banana peel?
I hate hiking with M. C. Escher.
Most climbing-related injuries occur on the way down.
There is no law he hasn't broken.
nah, I can't do it, not with my acid reflux...
He's never let blindness get in his way.
Thank god he's wearing a down jacket!!!
What's the worst that could happen?
I hate hiking with Escher.
Should we tell him the GPS is rerouting?
The secret is not to look down.
He doesn't realize the gravity of the situation.
Those are the best damn hiking shoes I've ever seen.
Okay, you win...we'll be your disciples.
I'm going to listen to my mother on this and not walk off a cliff just because my friend did.
I don't think he grasps the gravity of his situation.
You ought to see him on water.
He's been going down-hill for years.
Makes you wonder why nobody thought of that before.
I don't think he quite grasps the gravity of the situation.
Apparently he's not aware of the gravity of the situation.
Just admit that you're lost Bob!
Some people fail to see the gravity of the situation.
There goes Johnson, following the line of least resistance again!
He must really trust Google Maps.
Wow, I thought 'Messiah' was just his blog handle.
I don't think he's aware of the gravity of the situation.
What a showoff coming up backwards.
Oh sure, but can you walk back up?
Trump told him gravity is a hoax perpetrated by China.
No its okay, I'd rather you go next.
He said he'd arrive back at camp in nothing flat.
Don't wake him up!
I thought you said he was vertically challenged.
I know - he doesn't believe in global warming either
You really have to admire his optimism.
Well, one of us clearly did not understand the gravity of our situation.
He calls that move "Downward Facing Doug".
Not as good as walking on water, but still impressive.
Escher, wait up!
He's from the theoretical physics department.
He ate a whole box of Cliff Bars.
I wonder how his Fitbit will handle that?
If he makes it I'm getting a pair of those shoes.
He just needed 20 more steps to reach 10,000.
I'm afraid he's on a decline.
See, honey? I told you gravity was just an invention of the liberal media.
Don't say anything. He doesn't understand the gravity of the situation.
Oh yeah? Well, there's a big difference between the the road less traveled and the road never traveled!
He's one of those annoyingly clingy people.
Do you even have a million dollars?
He's about to hit rock bottom.
I was wondering why he ate all that goat cheese.
Apparently no one had ever bothered to try it.
All he said was, 'If global warming's just a hoax, then gravity's just a theory.'
Ever since he walked on water he's been looking for that next big thing.
The gravity of the situation seems lost on him.
Yes, he did seem down, but I didn't think he'd go over the edge.
On second thought, I'm good on badges.
He fails to appreciate the gravity of the situation.
He loves taking the path less traveled.
Well, we followed him this far.
I don't care if there's a Pokemon down there!
I hate it when he does that.
No thanks, Ralph . We're going to take the stairs.
Coming up backwards is just showing off.
Well, he did say he needed some down time.
GPS says this is the quickest way down.
Damn good boots.
What can I say, he trusts his GPS.
He's sleep walking. Don't wake him.
That has to be hard on his quads.
He's a portrait hiker in a landscape world.
Don't talk to me about the gravity of the situation!
Are you sure this is the beginners class?
The gravity of the situation hasn't hit him yet.
He doesn't know the gravity of this situation.
The lemming in me wants to follow.
He clearly doesn't understand the gravity of his situation.
90 degrees at this time of year?
This is the last time we're inviting M.C. Escher to our hikes.
Then again, there's a lot to be said for taking the beaten path.
He really needs to understand the gravity of this situation.
I hate playing Follow the Leader with Bob.
His blindness seems to be less of a hindrance than we anticipated.
It feels like 90 degrees up here too.
He's one of the last of the good lemming trackers.
Just don't wake him up!
Well, I admire his faith in Google maps.
He's just bluffing.
He must be in some perpendicular universe.
Frank gave up gravity years ago.
This could be a metaphor for just about anything.
A little over the edge, wouldn't you say?
Back in my day, it was uphill both ways.
We can see the wire.
If he makes it, I insist. You go next.
Let's just skip the Wile E. Coyote Memorial Trail.
He makes everything look easy.
We must be holding the map sideways.
He has more faith in Apple Maps than I do.
Trust me, it'll be his downfall.
He did say just past the next tree it was all downhill.
Looks like it's all downhill from here.
I could have sworn he was bluffing.
If climate change is a hoax, I suppose gravity could be too.
All I've defied is authority.
In Landscape Mode we'd be the ones in trouble
I don't care what his phone says, I'm sure we take a left here.
Harry has always taken the trail less traveled.
Don't you love Velcro?
Do you believe everything Google Maps tells you?
He doesn't believe in evolution either.
Don't be impressed - he just rotates the cartoon.
What kind of mushrooms did we eat?
Wow that's a strong updraft!
Told ya, the man has absolutely no sense of direction.
Definitely buying a pair, is all I know.
You don't have to do this! There's always Canada!
This is why I hate hiking with Escher
He just doesn't comprehend the gravity of the situation.
I can't but see this as a metaphor for the election.
He said, "If one of those two could become president then anything was possible." and he just started walking.
He refuses to accept the gravity of the situation
Sorry gravity, we're in a post-fact world now!
They say that’s normally the road not taken.
He's just practicing in case Trump gets elected.
Your turn. I'll wait here.
OK Fred, global warming might be a hoax and gravity might be a myth, but for heaven’s sakes, man, put on some sunscreen!
I think it’s time to ditch our guide.
Keep it down, we can't wake him up.
...but did you see how he struggled on the way up?
He insists on using Apple Maps.
No, I insist, you go next!
I guess the right pair of shoes really does make a difference.
Sometimes Bob relies a little too much on his GPS.
What drummer? I don't hear any drummer.
Not for nothing is it known as Mount Velcro.
Well he did say it's all downhill from here
Knock it off Jesus!
Never thought I'd see a cliff-hanger with no suspense.
He thinks gravity is a hoax invented by the Chinese.
Shh! We don't want to wake him.
Now Simon says take three steps backward.
He flunked Physics in college.
Just don't look up!
That's the last time I will make fun of his hiking boots.
Well, bread crumbs appear no longer an option.
You gotta love a cliffhanger.
Some people act as if laws don't apply to them.
I told you not to bring Escher.
And to think I laughed when he told me his boots cost 12,000 bucks.
When did follow the leader become an extreme sport?
I don't like his attitude.
I guess Herb didn't read the Cliff Notes.
Here's where this hike starts to go south.
Gravity was just a theory, right?
We've crossed the border, Fred, we're in Fox News territory now.
I guess we can't call him vertically challenged anymore.
He walks the walk. We talk the talk.
Going down is harder on the knees.
Google Maps said go south.
Stop showing off, Escher!
All I said is that we should head south...
So, you were sure about those mushrooms?
He did say it was the path less followed
Harry, come back. I'm certain I locked the car.
And that is why we call him Cliff.
He says the trick is to stare into the abyss.
What do you mean you forgot the camera?
Yoo-hoo! I don't think you understand the gravity of your situation.
Mind over splatter
I don't care if IS the road less traveled.
He said he needed some down time.
Just leave it. We can buy another baseball.
He always said gravity is only a theory.
Cross-country hiking hasn't been the same since the doping started.
He's technically proficient but lacking in direction.
Should we tell him about his laces ?
I told you he didn't know which end was up.
Should I tell him his shoelace is untied?
He is still quite unaware of the gravity of the situation.
I always thought that walking off a cliff would be a bit more.....dramatic
Should we be filming this?
That's what it means to suspend disbelief.
Wow, I guess he does have gravitas.
Why do you think he said "goodbye" instead of his usual "see you later."
We wasted all three wishes.
What do you know -- Siri was right!
'That's the last time we use DiscountSherpas.com...'
A perpendicularist! Who knew?!
He's not that daring. It's not a backpack. It's a parachute.
He likes the road less travelled....
So this is what the map meant by Hiker Falls.
When you get half way down, throw up a rope.
He exists in a perpendicular universe.
At some point, Pokemon Go just isn't worth it.
Well, I guess if Donald Trump can live in an alternate universe, so can Ned.
The lake at the bottom will be the real test.
If you look at it from his perspective, we're the ones falling.
Whatever he paid for those boots, it was worth it.
This is where I draw a line collecting Pokemon.
You first.
Be quiet, we don't want to wake him.
You should see the the reaction when he leaves his fifth floor office.
Global warming?? He doesn't even believe in gravity!
Should we tell him his pack is open?
What a showoff, walking up here backwards.
He had me when he walked across the lake.
His GPS is set to find the fastest route.
That's a man who has total faith in his GPS.
He's obviously unfazed by the gravity of the situation.
Are you gonna tell him, or should I?
Yeah...he can be a little condescending...
I wonder how he'd do on water.
He seems to be descending at the right angle.
It's ok. You can go next.
One third of our party is in steep decline.
You should be okay, but I'm afraid my glasses will fall off.
If he was gonna fall, I think it would have happened by now.
You can go next.
I prefer the high road.
He's been on edge recently.
Are we in his dream, or is he in our dream?
No I insist; after you...
Try adjusting the horizontal.
Should we tell him you have the car keys?
Hiking with Escher is always a challenge.
Obviously he doesn't understand the gravity of his situation.
He fails to recognize the gravity of his situation.
He can't do that. The sign said to stay on designated, marked trails.
You should have taken "truth."
I don't think you appreciate the gravity of the situation
No Pokémon is worth this.
That’s not leadership I’m ready to follow.
Next time he says "I know a shortcut" let's ask for more information.
I know it's shorter but I'm going back the way we came.
Is it him or is it us?
He had nowhere left to go but down.
He really takes it personally when you call him vertically challenged.
Yeah, well it's always easier going downhill.
My cousin tried to do that once... Once!
It's easier than it looks.
Not only that, he's walking backwards.
I don't think you understand the gravity of this situation.
I don't think you understand the gravity of the situation Larry.
Bob insists gravity is a liberal conspiracy.
He won't back down.
Should we tell him?
I never hear that drummer.
Doesn't he know the gravity of the situation?
Polls were right... he is gaining traction.
Nike really thinks of everything
He always chooses the road not taken.
Now you know why we call him "Cliff."
Damn smart shoes...there's no skill involved anymore!
Escher! Stop showing off.
You think that's something? Wait till he puts on his roller skates
He's not respecting the gravity of our situation.
Clearly, he doesn't get the gravity of the situation.
I never thought he'd go downhill so fast.
I'd like to get a hold of his Cliff Notes.
Think it's our suspension of disbelief or his lack of gravitas?
Don't always take the path less traveled
Big deal - let's see him try it WITHOUT a cane.
Did you really have to say, "It's all downhill from here?"
It's OK. He's a direct descendant.
It doesn't have to be a race to the bottom
I'm starting to hate Pokemon Go...
It's amazing how his hat stays on.
Some people will do anything for better cell phone reception.
I don't think he understands the gravity of the situation, here.
He just doesn't seem to understand the gravity of this situation.
He failed physics in high school, you know what they say; "What you don't know can't hurt you."
Dibs on his boots.
Sometimes you have to let them hit rock bottom before you can truly help.
This must be the high degree of difficulty part.
I would've bought those shoes too, but they don't provide good ankle support.
They said we may have trouble keeping up with this guide.
If he walks on the water it's him.
That's nothin'! Wait until he comes back with the water!
Dave has always been more of a doer than a thinker.
What'd I tell ya? You can't go wrong leading from behind.
Whatever you do, don't look straight ahead!
I'm not following his investment advice either!
Going down is the easy part. I want to see him walk back up.
Velcro on moss. I wish I'd thought of that.
Ever since he got that Fitbit there's no living with him.
So that's what happens when you engage your core!
Iron mountain, magnetic shoes.
You follow. I've got the rear.
I guess it's all a matter of perspective.
Maybe he's like Trump: All the hot air inside is what keeps him from falling.
This is the part with those killer views I mentioned.
He got tired of living on the edge.
Tim, I think the GPS is wrong.
He also has no sense of perspective.
You see that son? That's why you never lock your phone in landscape mode!
Just let it go Tom! When we get home I'll buy you another iPhone.
Come back, Curt, she won the debate!"
Well, after talking the talk, you can't accuse Herb of not walking the walk.
I'm worried he relies a little too much on GPS.
I told him not to set his GPS on fastest route!
Mt Velcro is his favorite
He prefers landscape mode.
Good but can he yodel at the same time?
Ever since he stepped into that Yak poop those shoes will stick to anything
Is he on the level?
Apple Maps says it's a trail.
Harvey is a charter member of the Flat Earth Society.
Just wait until he realizes his pockets aren't zipped
I hear the views are to die for.
The locals call him Dances With Gravity.
Wait, you forgot your glasses.
Try it without the walking stick!
I think his GPS is trying to kill him.
It's like I've always said, gravity is just a hoax invented by the Chinese
Remind me again....are we leaders or followers ?
Beats me. He just said it's all downhill from here.
Let's meet him at the emergency room.
He’ll be Ok as long as he doesn’t wake up.
So far the gum seems to be working.
He's one of those gravity deniers.
Seriously good hiking boots there Frank.
If Bob decides to flip this cartoon its side, we'll be the laughing stock.
It may look safe, but don't follow him! He falls in the next panel.
It looks hard on the knees.
"You go next... I'm right behind you.
I thought he'd been looking at little on edge lately but obviously he's way over that now.
Ed, you fool, Fitbit won't count those as "steps."
According to the map he's going the wrong way.
Well, if you look at it from another angle...he's on top and we're in trouble...
Wait a sec, let me review my cliff notes.
First evolution, then global warming, and now gravity.
If he had a better sense of direction, he'd be the greatest hiker ever.
We should’ve read the Cliffs Notes.
Now those are climbing shoes.
That''s new. He used to just walk on water.
Damn path-less-traveled show-off.
His life coach told him there's nothing he can't do.
You had to hire the cheapest guide?
I'm good here. How about you?
His iPhone is stuck in landscape mode.
Fine! Fine! Just walk away like you always do!
He decided to follow Trump's political campaign.
Why did you have to bring Escher?
You can go straight to hell!
Dibs on those shoes.
He says gravity is a Chinese hoax
Harry's a gravity denier.
It can only be explained as a case of mind over Matterhorn.
Well, that's one less Trump supporter
Fred is not just a good hiker. He's scary good.
You owe me $20 bucks, Frank.
Back in my day, we had to go uphill both ways!
My mom always asked me if a friend walked off a cliff, would I follow?
Ok! You win! Gravity is just a theory!
No, no. What I think is most impressive is that he's walking backwards.
Oh man... Peyote was a bad idea.
I hate this part of the Escher Trail.
And this is where our hike starts to go south.
This is why I didn't want to invite Escher to come hiking with us.
You're right, down is so much easier.
Well, it'll be a lot quicker than the way up.
His new medication has side effects.
That's Zeke. Always the path of least resistance.
Sooner or later Escher is going to try that one time too often.
Don't be fooled. It's actually harder than it looks.
That idiot!! Now he's lost the car keys.
His faith in GPS is a LOT stronger than mine.
OK, Your Turn
He's a big Wiley Coyote fan
I come out here to get away from hipsters, not watch them hike ironically.
I think I'll just stay here and yodel.
What a show off, climbing up backwards.
Don't worry. Harry is a retired cartoonist.
He's been diagnosed with Gravity Defiance Disorder.
I told you he wouldn't jump.
I knew he was an old goat.
I always said he lacked gravitas.
Be careful. They say most accidents happen on the way down.
Retirement hasn't been easy for Spiderman.
He says gravity is a hoax perpetrated by China.
Iron rock magnetic shoes and booze.
I don't think this is what Robert Frost had in mind.
Perspective is everything.
Let's see how far he gets.
He always chooses the path less taken.
You next.
Gravity? He doesn't acknowledge evolution either!
He said he read the Cliffs Notes.
Good thing Gravity is only a theory.
He's unaware that gravity's not just a good idea, it's the law.
If you stop that right now, we won't tell the Physics Department.
He says it's just attitude over altitude
Shhh, waking a sleepwalker can be dangerous.
This is why you let your sherpa win at poker, Steve.
Frank, you'll be fine, just don't look down.
Okay, come back, we'll buy your stupid magnets.
I hate how he pretends he's not trying.
He's using the new Trump GPS.
when we finish this trip, let's get a new guide.
Gravity is a hoax created by the Chinese.
I'm afraid Isaac just isn't aware of the gravity of his situation!
I'm rethinking this whole "Lemming Club" membership.
Some shortcut.
Let's face it. Carl went over the edge years ago.
His vertigo never bothers him, just an occasional bout of horizontigo......
Do we help him now or wait until he hits rock bottom?
I find that when you just look at it from another angle, it's not really all that impressive.
Fred never did have much respect for Newton.
Tell us if you find a better route.
Don't worry... He's blind, so he doesn't know it's impossible!
Whatever you do, don't look up.
He would never try this outside this cartoon.
in two hundred feet turn left, your destination will be on your right
He's a gravity denier.
I hate when these guided tours end with a cliffhanger.
Son, I don't think thats what Siri meant by keep heading South
I always like a good cliffhanger.
That's a bit over the top
LSD and crazy glue make a really bad combination.
He has an inner ear problem.
We need to get to the bottom of this.
He dosen't appear to appreciate the gravity his situation.
He took the road less traveled, and that has made all the difference.
Waze did say it was the fastest route.
Pretend it's no big deal.
Not me. You tell him he can't do that.
Yeah but can he walk back up?
He chose this because walking on water was already taken.
It's always easier going downhill.
I don't think you realize the gravity of your situation.
That's nothing. You should see him dancing on the ceiling.
Is he texting while hiking again?
Walt, I think you're missing the gravity of the situation.
According to the Lonely Planet it's The Road Less Traveled.
Just bend your knees.
Do what you want, I'm taking the LOW road.
He's always defying something.
Ira may be unaware of the gravity of his situation.
I concede. He'll beat us to the bottom.
He said he had complete faith in Google Maps
I told him to turn off that GPS!
Can you believe it, he fell 5 times coming up here?
Should we tell him that the presidential candidates have already won the race to the bottom?
Well, now we know why he packed his golf shoes
Are there no laws you won't break?
He'll go where ever 'Pokémon go' takes him.
I worry about Harry when he wanders off on his own.
You tell him..I'm not gonna tell him.
A path less taken!
I guess he does have gravitas.
He's also a gravity denier.
Harry always took the path less traveled on.
It's a rare form of dyslexia.
After you, I insist.
I thought he was kidding when he said that was the shortest way down.
I guess it's just a matter of perspective.
I don't know, it's what the GPS said.
I told you he lacks gravitas.
Yeah, but can he do it while chewing gum?
The suspense is killing me.
The race to the bottom is over!
This is where the camera turns and we both fall backward.
He suffers from a lack of gravitas.
Look out, Cliff!
I don't know his real name. He's about to be Jack Splat!
He was always anti-establishment, anti-taxes, anti-government. Now he's gone anti-gravity.
Duct tape. Is there anything it can't do?
He no longer appears to be vertically challenged.
Of course going back down is always easier...
I specifically remember Mom saying if your friend "jumps" off a cliff...
I think Pete is going to go down in history!
Rotate this cartoon a quarter turn clockwise, and we're the ones in trouble.
He really meant it when he said "It's all downhill from here"
They say it's harder on the knees going down.
Frank's navigation app still has some glitches.
Are you seeing this? Dammit, I knew we shouldn't have eaten those mushrooms.
Well, from his point of view, we're standing on the side of a mountain with a tree branch sticking out behind us.
Escher, get up here now!
If you follow you'll just bring yourself down to his level.
I try to follow the road less traveled, but I think I'll just stay on the trail this time.
You should see him on water.
Now's not the time to tell him mind-over-matter is just a saying.
So far he's descended the lowest peaks on all seven continents.
If anyone clicks 'rotate' in photoshop, we'll be the ones who look silly.
He got the good stick.
Don't worry - he's a Physics Professor
I know, when I asked about his new boots, all he said was you'll see.
Do you want to tell him, or should I?
Does Escher ever stop showing off?
Personally, I think his "mind over matter" attitude will be his downfall...
We don't tolerate descent.
Crap! Now he'll never stop talking about his fancy new hiking shoes.
Would it kill you to stop for lunch?
Hey, Cliff Walker, we promise not to laugh at your name anymore
OK, Jesus, that's not fair!
He finds shortcuts that most of us simply miss.
Magnet shoes help a lot here on Iron Mountain.
Ah Jeremy, we parked down the other side of the mountain...
Actually it's harder than it looks!
I don't know, he says it's a lot easier than climbing up all the time.
That is the most stubborn blind man I have ever met.
Should we tell him or let nature takes its course?
Yes, he does have a lot of stick-to-it-ness
It's all in shifting your weight and balance. You go next.
He has never trusted Siri.
Maybe we should have stuck with the 'Mid-Level Mountaineering' package.
If Trump can be the Republican candidate, I guess anything's possible now.
Nobody likes a show-off Bob.
He took the path less traveled by, and its made all the difference....
Photoshop
He calls it downward mobility, but I just call it elaborate suicide.
It is a straight line on the map.
He stepped in gum.
Did you inform him the adhesive wears off after a few minutes?
Tech support suggested that you turn the map clockwise 90 degrees
We're right behind you, Clyde...
He found a loophole in the Law of Gravity.
He's still not using the stick properly.
Well, it's not like walking on water.
Go on now, Johnson. You're next.
It's 90 degrees out today.
Showoff had to walk up backwards
He says it's easy if you stick to it.
I told you,"Gravity is only a theory."
He has a reputation for losing people.
I'm not surprised. Lately, his behavior has been a little over the edge...
Maybe those gravity truthers are on to something.
So much for Newton's hypothesis
It fulfills a pledge he made as a presidential candidate.
He still thinks the earth is flat.
It's OK, he came up this way.
I admire the way he can ignore the gravity of the situation.
Talk about living on the edge
You don't understand the gravity of the situation!
Shoulders back! Use your core! You've got this!
He chose the path of least resistance.
He's coming back up...even more impressive!!
The ranger said stay on the trail.
Joe was raised by geckos.
Well, he always said you and I were vertically challenged.
Don't worry, we'll catch up.
I don't think Henderson understands the gravity of the situation
He did say the hike back down was much easier than the climb up.
I'm Sorry I told him he's an old goat.
If Fred Astaire can do it so can I
I TOLD him to wait a week before installing iOS 10.
He's always been a path of least resistance kind of guy
I heard he's inclined to take risks.
There's an app for that.
As a hiker, Sheldon lacks gravitas.
So, I'm guessing the blind guide has great hearing.
50 dollars says he trips over a loose rock and falls flat on his face.
I'm beginning to think he's not a carpenter.
Last week he was walking on water.
For goodness sake don't rotate the magazine
Never underestimate the power of Velcro
Robert always takes the road less traveled.
Can we stick to the path more traveled?
It's ok, he google mapped it...
Two choices: we can either assume we're in an M.C. Escher drawing and go over the cliff, or we can hike back to town and have a few beers. Did I mention that I'm buying?
Oh Jesus!...You can do that too?
I don't believe it! His hat isn't falling off.
He's a climate change denier. Physics don't apply to him.
Sometimes it's just better not to know.
No, YOU go ahead...
I wish Mom was alive so I could finally answer that jumping off a cliff stuff she was always asking about.
You should see what he can do in high heels.
Gravity schmavity.
Herb's not the fall guy we thought he was
The way down is always harder on the knees.
He wants to take us in a new direction.
The descent is harder on the knees.
John believes the law of gravity is an unjust law.
For the life of me, I can't fathom why he insists on walking up backwards.
You know, if you turn us sideways we're the ones in trouble.
The old goat still got it in him.
and please don't spill the coffee on the way back up.
You just had to bring Mr. Holier-than-Thou!
This is the last time we use Apple Maps.
They don't call this Velcro Mountain for nothing.
Stay calm, and try not to look up
He says you just put one foot in front of the other.
I never saw him as vertically challenged.
He's always had a knack for getting to the bottom of things
He said he wanted to drop in on a friend.
Well, I take his point about environmental impact but, ecologically speaking, he's still leaving a footprint.
Lemming Research demands commitment...
Yeah, but if they turn the magazine 90 degrees, WE'RE the ones defying gravity.
I think the GPS might need patching again
He's in denial.
He started going downhill fast right after high school.
He's showboating again. Last week he walked on water.
Don't call his attention to it, let's just see what happens!
He finally went over the edge. He's now headed for the deep end.
I'm not sure you appreciate the gravity of your situation.
The last time he said 'don't worry just follow me' it didn't end well.
He say's, hold the page sideways.
He's taking 'The Road Less Taken' a little too literally.
I guess the rules don't apply to this guy
He's a climate change denyer, too.
Are you sure there was nothing else in his trail mix?
OK I believe you. Come back up and make us some wine.
He really trusts his GPS.
He bought those shoes from a movie theater employee.
The old guys don't rely so much on GPS.
He's late for his Cirque du Soleil audition.
Don't say it's a miracle, we're atheists.
As usual, the gravity of our situation is lost on him.
Because I have cartoon physics on my side - that's why!
I always knew he would go off the deep end .
He never seemed to grasp physics.
Lets find out where he buys his hiking boots.
Gee, I sure hope he doesn't suddenly wake up now.
When he goes low, we go high.
Morris never understood the gravity of the situation.
I take the road less travelled.
He's always taking the road not taken.
The gravity of this situation doesn't seem to affect him.
They say it's harder going down.
He was right. It is, in fact, all downhill from here.
I don't think Jeffrey realizes the gravity of the situation.
Do you think he understands the gravity of his actions?
I'd wait until he's at least halfway down.
Just because he's our guide doesn't mean we have to follow him... right?
Like I said, Frank, it's all downhill from here.
Call me chicken, but I'm going back the way we came!
The Swiss...great mountaineers, poor team players.
Talk about the power of positive thinking!
Is there a downside?
We're both sorry if we upset you.
I guess he doesn't get the gravity of the situation.
That looks relativity easy.
Sorry for the confusion, Cliff, but I wasn't just saying your name.
He's gotten good at scaling back.
Always with that unbeaten path thing.
And you thought hiking up was difficult.
Where did he say he got those new hiking shoes?
I told him to go straight to hell
He's voting for Trump
Every weekend it's the same - we go out for a hike, and then the survivors are rescued by helicopter.
This feels like one of those, 'if all your friends jumped off a cliff' moments.
Where did he say he bought those boots?
Of course, if he's right and this really is printed sideways, then it's you and me who are in trouble, Dave.
Actually, we were supposed to go right.
Do we tell him?
Show off.
He'll follow Trump anywhere.
There is a down side to everything!
You can take that 'road less traveled' idea too far, you know!
You guys wait here. I'm going to scout ahead for dangers.
He knows there's nothing down there, right?
I've never seen him this on edge before
They say you are not supposed to wake a sleepwalker.
When he goes low, we stay high.
You shouldn't have called him vertically challenged.
When this Hiking App said proceed South, I was skeptical at first.
I told you we didn't tip him enough.
Milo doesn't appreciate the gravity of the situation.
You know, if the page is rotated to the right, our situation is far less humorous.
Is it steep?
Jesus, he's such a show off. First water, now this.
That's easy, It's getting back up that's hard.
Well! Now you're just showing off...
The really interesting part is he's walking backward.
He lacks Gravitas.
We never should've gone hiking with a zen master.
I see somebody just HAS to show off his new hiking shoes.
Do you think he still needs the walking stick?
He's wearing those stupid virtual reality glasses
You should see what he does on water.
I don't think you realize the gravity of the situation.
He's never known which way is up.
Believe me when I tell you, it's a shortcut.
He said he's going to find Escher.
You're next...No you're next...No go ahead...No you go ahead...
Aye, he’ll be in Scotland afore us.
I think I'll go around.
Al knows a shortcut.
Um...you second!
He's in the zone. Just watch, he'll get halfway down and go oops.
I hope he appreciates the gravity of his achievement.
...because he can.
He doesn't appreciate the gravity of his predicament.
I bet you feel really stupid for yelling, 'Don't do it!'
I think we should take the long way down.
I'm pretty sure they wouldn't put a Pokemon three quarters of the way down the cliff.
Well, he's clever enough, but he lacks _gravitas_.
I could never walk in his footsteps.
He's also the libertarian candidate for President.
Technically it is a short-cut!
We get it already, you're the more experienced hiker.
His new smart phone comes with that app.
If someone turns the magazine 90 degrees to the right, that guy is fine, but we are in a heap of trouble.
Gravity's a state of mind, boys.
Oh, just let him go---I'm sick of his bragging about his homemade nutrition bars.
Or we could just make camp?
I'll let you tell him he's going the wrong way.
He's the Fred Astaire of hiking.
You have to admit, he does have an interesting perspective.
Did he mention where he bought his hiking boots?
Do you ever get the feeling we're in an Escher painting?
I thought "race to the bottom" only has to do with economics and trade.
On second thought, we're not in such a hurry.
Neither gravity or reality applied to climbers from the Trump Expedition club.
I never said it was a good idea, I just said lemmings do it all the time.
It's all about core strength.
He insists gravity is a hoax.
No question... best hiker I've ever seen.
I think you should go first.
He has never been able to confront reality.
Fred used to work at Cirque du Soleil
Well of course 'downhill' is always easier.
Who's the lemming now, Eugene?
What's impressive is he is walking backwards too...
When we are lost, he never admits it.
OK, you've got the shoe endorsement. Now get back up here.
Well, I did tell him a ninety-degree turn.
A journey of a thousand feet begins with a single step.
Your knees! Bend your knees!
That is a serious updraft...
We all laughed at him for majoring in Cartoon Physics.
Believe me- this is the best trail. Nobody builds a trail better than me. I guarantee it.
He has great faith in Google Maps.
It's not his sure-footedness I'm questioning.
Right behind you.
Give him a sec, it always takes a bit for gravity to catch up to cartoons.
Impressive, but Nick Wallenda did it on a unicycle blindfolded.
He has been going downhill for awhile.
You know, he's been going downhill for years
Has to get in his 10,000 steps.
It's all about perspective.
I want a pair of those!
He can't climb
I don't care what his GPS says.
They call him Cliff.
Please, you go next.
He claims it's just a matter of perspective.
Looks like we'll be back at camp sooner than I thought.
... and grab me a cup of coffee when you come back up.
Try not to look down...
We better hope no one rotates this cartoon.
Hiking really changed his perspective.
We know you have a way.But do you also have a will?
Wow...Glen really went downhill.
I'll take that bet.
He's right - this cartoon IS sideways.
I've always admired Fred's sticktuitiveness.
The brochure did guarantee the most direct route
Are you coming back?
Somehow, Bob remains undaunted by the gravity of the situation.
He calls it 'trumped up trickle down.'
He took the road less traveled, and should I call his wife or you.
Just like him to show off by climbing up backwards!
He has tremendous personal magnetism.
It's just a theory!
He says that gravity is just a hoax, created by and for the rope companies in order to sell more rope.
Uh, you go first!
Welcome to Velcro Mountain.
Wow, this is a real cliffhanger.
He'd never let a little thing like gravity stand in his way.
This is the last time I'm going hiking with M.C. Escher!
Okay, this game of 'Follow the Leader' has definitely taken a down turn.
He must have set his phone to landscape
Well, he's not coming back
That's not south!
First he denied climate change, but gravity?
He's always been anti everything, including gravity.
The gravity of the situation doesn't appear to phase him at all.
Never wake up a sleep walker.
It's not as easy as it looks.
It's OK. He was raised by goats.
Damn it, Escher, cut it out!
The joke's on him...he's wearing MY Fitbit.
He has an unusual center of gravity.
He has a Pre-Newtonian concept of gravity
Okay, you go next!
He said getting back would be harder.
What are the odds he'd find a velcro cliff for his velcro shoes?
Well now I don't feel so bad about not warning him.
WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T LOOK DOWN!
So now he is officially over the hill.
This is the last time I come for one of your Pokemon Go outings.
He really is over the hill ....
I think I'll take the other shortcut.
He's got those new Escher boots.
Just for the record if you turned this cartoon to the right we'd be amazing
Not much of a cliffhanger.
The technique's called mind over Matterhorn.
He's calling it "extreme hiking".
Just engage your core.
Why did we choose a leader who doesn't understand Science?
How Isaac understands the gravity of any situation is beyond me.
It's always more difficult going back down.
The good news is that it's all down hill from here
They say he was the first person to climb down Everest.
He's always been a downer.
You go second, Ronnie.
Sorry, Mr. Lemming, you're on your own this time.
Now that's a real cliffhanger.
Come on Harry, you'd be up here by now if you didn't walk backwards
He believes gravity is a conspiracy created by the Chinese.
You know, Fred, your Fitbit may not count those vertical steps.
He swears it's easier on the knees.
He's been like this ever since he failed high school physics.
Well the tour company did say off the beaten path.
He always said gravity was overrated.
Man I didn't think he was being this literal when he said he was gonna walk till he dropped.
So far, so good, but he's going to have trouble where it gets flat down there.
He is from down under.
So what's Escher doing now?
Hiking is 10 percent mental, 90 percent shoes.
What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
He always did think he was above Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation.
I think he misunderstood our discussion about Cliff Notes.
"I think I heard him say, ' screw ' gravity".
He obviously never saw a Roadrunner cartoon.
It's even more spectacular during ski season.
This is a drawing of a cliff. It is not an actual cliff. Had this been an actual cliff, you would find a warning sign advising you are not able to safely walk over the edge without proper safety equipment.
Well, if you turn the page upside down you two are the ridiculous ones...
Well, it's one of the 1,000 Places to See Before You Die
Everything he does has to be over the top.
Dangerous? Depends on your perspective.
What he lacks in brains and good looks, he makes up in stick-to-it-iveness.
It's times like these I'm glad I'm not a lemming.
That trail has an unobstructed view.
Yes, Mel, a rope would have been nice.
We've got to stop telling him he lacks gravitas.
I'll never doubt Google Maps again.
he said his life is going down hill.
He figured out how to do that from watching that old Fred Astaire movie
Maybe he doesn't just think he's God.
He has been bragging about those new boots...
When you said 'it's all downhill from here' I didn't think you meant it literally
He says he learned it from watching old Warner Bros. cartoons.
He's never led a hike before, but he's been very successful in business.
The faith of a Trump supporter is unbounded.
Is he the one high on LSD or is it us?
That is when things really started to go sideways.
He says you have to stand up to gravity.
He says it's all about core strength.
He has been on edge for weeks.
Walking down is easy. I want to see him walk back up.
He always did have a way of making the impossible look easy
Damn auto rotate
I think it was the lemming jerky.
Abstract hiking isn't for everyone.
If I'd known he could do that I would have told him to 'go jump off a cliff' a long time ago.
Yet another time in 2016 when the conventional wisdom was wrong.
Gravity? Now THERE'S a hoax.
Make that 1001 uses for duct tape...
Americans call it "The road less traveled"
The guidebook did mention that the remote regions were considered lawless.
He must be related to M.C. Escher.
How much time does the short cut save?
I didn't realize the fiscal cliff was a real place.
Oh no, this might be when a cartoonist turns the picture on its side and we fall off?
For God's sake don't look down!
Looks like Joe is finally going off the deep end.
I can see why they call it "Death Valley".
Waze says it's the fastest route!
I'd follow him but I'm afraid my fitbit won't count those steps.
He said don't worry it's all downhill from here....
The Flat Earth Society Said This Would Work
That's it for these Escher hikes.
I told him to take a long walk off of a short cliff..
He never DID know when to stop ...
I shouldn't have insisted it's a bluff.
I think he's losing his edge.
How ticked do you figure he'll be when he finds out we got here first?
I don't think I'll ever live this one down.
He always has to live life on the edge.
He always believes in taking the path not taken
He's out to disprove gravity. Next comes evolution and global warming.
He's been down so long, it looks like up to him.
Fine--win the race to the bottom.
But by golly he's gonna get that Pikachu.
Those new Jordans are something else
Jesus Christ! Not again!
I told you not to pay him up front!
"I didn't say "Simon Says".
I don't care how many times he does this, the cane is a crutch!
He really shouldn't have used Apple Maps.
Harry never did know which way was up.
He can walk on water, too.
Maybe he will get to Scotland before us..
He read the cliff's notes.
He does know how to get to the bottom of things
Man, that was good acid!
C'mon guys. It's all downhill from here.
Can I have your s'mores?
Maybe now would be a good time to turn around?
I don't want to be his Fitbit friend anymore.
It's easy--just turn the page sideways.
They did say the trail down would be steep.
I never thought anyone would make it all the way up backwards!
When you get to the bottom, throw me a rope and help me down.
He insists it's the fastest way to the bottom.
Google Maps said to go straight
I bet he'd make a great caddy.
I knew we shouldn't have eaten that plant.
Seems illogical but to be honest I've never tried.
That's what I call a trailblazer!
His map must be folded in a different place from ours.
It's all in the stick, you know.
You know what, Spiderman? Sometimes you can be a real jerk.
It's OK, you'll be fine. Just don't look up!
His wife told him to take a short hike off a high cliff.
She sure makes it look easy coming up backwards and in heels.
You know they say gravity is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.
He has always been downwardly mobile.
legalizing cannibas in this state was a bad idea.
Huge downside potential.
Going up is much harder.
How the hell do we rate THIS trail?
Fine. You can go straight to hell.
..ever since he saw that Fred Astaire movie
It works as long as you continue to believe.
The first step is the hardest
I see Lefkowitz has finally gone over the edge.
It's possible if you never change your socks.
He's doing it wrong.
I'm afraid it's all downhill from here!
He is vertically challanged.
He told me he was voting Trump...reality will kick in any minute
That new walking stick really does improve his balance.
He refused to understand the gravity of this situation.
How long do you give him?
He said "Gravity is just a theory."
Should we tell him he's not in a cartoon !?
It's not like he can walk on water.
He said he does water too.
Dr. Lemming I presume
For Fred, gravity is just a theory.
You did remember to tie the rope from his ankle to the tree, right?
They say he sold his soul for that walking stick.
He never knows when to stop.
I'll be damned. Maybe he IS from a perpendicular universe.
Apparently, it's how you feel about gravity that counts.
He attended a Tony Robbins seminar
Just because 100,000 scientists say gravity is a thing doesn't mean I have to believe in it.
Very convincing, Jesus. But can you do it on water?
WATCH OUT FOR THE LAWS OF PHYSICS!
This calls to mind a poem by Frost.
If you could see the length of his cleats, you'd understand.
"I thought you were going to tell him the anti-gravity shoes were a just gag".
All right, you win! Your shoes are better.
He's so smug about it, too.
Sorry, we have no inclination to follow you.
I wonder where he got those shoes
Yeah, but the hike back up is a killer.
And the signs of dehydration are what again?
You've really got to hand it to those REI people.
Fred!?! Do you understand the gravity of this situation??
I guess that explains why he didn't feel he had to be nice to us on the way up.
Come on , try the road less traveled
He's been going down hill for some time now.
Well, always trust the G.P.S.
Bring us back some sandwiches!
You're over thinking it.
Don't worry, it's only a fiscal cliff...
And you told me he was on the level.
The going down part is easy - coming back up really tests you
. . . and yet again proving the fallacy of the "slippery slope" argument
He was more impressive when he walked on water.
Sherpa, my butt. He's just got better shoes.
C'mon Larry! Can't you take a joke?
Okay, that is pretty cool....but the boots are still ugly.
Smart boots.
I told you we should have bought the more expensive hiking boots
You hear that. He knows the words to Edelweiss.
Kind of a comedown. A little while ago he was walking on air.
He's always marched to a different drummer.
It's his smarmy attitude I can't stand.
Okay, the Sermon on the Mount was amazing, but now He is just showing off!
He's in congress and doesn't believe in global warming either.
Come on guys, it's all down hill from here.
He did promise that his first act as President would be the repeal of the Law of Gravity.
They say hiking down is the hardest on the knees
Humor me... double check the GPS.
Do you think I should tell him it was only a metaphor?
Guess we'll have to quit teasing Oglethorpe about his expensive new boots. . .
Enough, I've followed this guy all over the place but now things are really starting to go downhill.
They say he was the first to use this trail.
Y'know what the weird thing is? His GPS location will still be the same as ours.
Well it could be the quickest way down
Sherman never seems to acknowledge the gravity of the situation.
He's never been on the level with us.
I really need a pair of those hiking shoes.
``I've got the car keys, show-off!!!''
I get it. This year's presidential election is "a race to the bottom".
Well, that makes our position rather untenable.
Having the right gear is really so important out here!
Gravity is not working. Blame it on Obama!
I really hate his damn short cuts
Magnetic soles, ferrite cliff---how foresightful!
Sometimes the shortest route is not the best.
OK, I'll go next, but are you SURE we're just a cartoon?
When you get to the bottom, drop a rope to us.
Wow, he was right. Those new boots are awesome!
Cliff prefers the path less taken.
After the past year, nothing surprises me anymore.
Joe, just remember it is lot harder coming up
I'll follow you.
We'll drop you a line sometime.
Looks like Herbie's idea finally got traction.
Oh great, another cliffhanger.
On the other hand, it's all downhill from here.
Gravity is just a theory.
And don't you forget my pastrami on rye.
I told you he was a real downer.
I think the Boy Scouts needs to rethink this new "extreme sports" merit badge.
Man, these third party voters will find an alternative for everything!
He's definitely vertically intergrated.
Ken's never been a social climber.
Bert likes to think outside the cliff.
He found those boots on Ebay.
I'll bring up the rear.
That’s one small step for man... and one giant leap of faith by Bob.
I think he said, "Walk this way."
Those new 'Air Sherpas' are sweet!
It's easy, fellas.Just suspend your disbelief.
It's all core strength.
Well, he never claimed to be a Newtonian.
Do you think Cliff Walker is his real name?
Physics was never his strong suit.
You're not fooling anyone, Superman.
I bet he thinks he can walk on water too!
I told you we are on Mt. Velcro.
Tell me again what he's been putting into his trail mix?
After you, Ted.
See, gravity is just a theory.
According to ancestry.com, he's part goat.
I'm not stopping until I hit my 10,000 steps.
I can hear my mom's voice asking me if I'd go after him.
There's nothing down there anyway.
My mom asked me once what I would do in this very scenario, but I assumed it was rhetorical.
Allen is amazing, he'll walk until he drops.
Hey! Fred? You gotta hole in your pants.
His GPS was hacked by Russian squirrels.
Do you think we should tell him?
Fred will go anywhere to catch a new Pokémon
Everyone knows that going down is easier!
He's always had a lousy sense of direction.
Well he certainly makes that look easy.
I guess the rules don't apply to him.
It's all downhill from here.
He's always had a hard time asking for directions.
He just does what his GPS tells him to do.
Only Bob would think to Velcro the entire cliffside.
Think he knows what's up?
He does have a certain stick-to-it-iveness...
He told me he's all in for being downwardly mobile!
He never did know up from down...
According to cartoons, this only lasts until he realizes where he is.
Every man walks his own reality.
I'm starting to rethink this whole agnostic thing.
He's one of those "the world is flat" believers.
If you turn this picture sideways we're the ones defying gravity.
watch him pick up speed!
I'd rather take the stairs.
I suppose he walks on water, too
He's one of those "gravity is a theory" types.....
He doesn't believe in global warming OR gravity.
I guess the more expensive shoes are worth it.
See? You just gotta find the right angle.
A bit overboard even for Pokemon, I'd say.
Yeah! Well Yodel-Ay-Dee-Effin-O to you too!
He teaches Relativity at Princeton.
This is a real cliff hanger.
What he doesn't realize is that going down is hell on the knees.
I guess those boots were worth the extra ten dollars.
This is the third game in a row of Follow the Leader that he has won.
He used to work for Lehman Brothers.
Is he trying out the Velcro Trail?
Sure it looks impressive. But when you turn your head sideways, WE'RE the ones defying gravity.
He's in total denial.
That's nothing; you should hear him yodel.
And, I thought the ad for those shoes was a lot of bunk.
He's been watching too many Road Runner cartoons.
Don't you realize the gravity of what you are doing?
He's always showing off, you should have seen what he did last week on the lake.
Follow me. It's not so bad. Just avoid looking up!
What will Nike come up with next?
There goes Robert Frost again.
The trick is not to look down.
When they said he was "a little light in the loafers," I thought it meant something else.
Just like Harold, to take the easy way out!
When do the cartoon physics kick in?
I detest his lack of gravity.
His faith in GPS is truly powerful.
I have to get some of those shoes.
He never did know which way was up.
He binge watched all The Matrix movies last night.
Go ahead, but I'm not falling for that again.
Hiking with Superman is less fun than I thought it would be.
He must be one of those flat earthers.
Just keep your core tight.
It helps to have a good attitude, eat a healthy diet and have special boots.
I love convincing Libertarians that the government invented gravity.
That's not the way we came!
Now do you believe me that he's the guy who invented Velcro.
CHECK YOUR GPS!
What did he just say? He said so far, so good.
I told you we needed to work on our core.
He wrote the book on vertical descents.
He's underleveredged.
He always sticks to the trail.
It's steeper than it looks.
Isaac, come back, you've made your point.
Just don't look down.
Do you think he's coming back up?
I don't care what he said, I'm calling an Uber.
Let's just take a cab.
OK, so alternative universes may exist. But they definitely aren't parallel!
And to think, when he said gravity was a hoax perpetrated by China, I just laughed.
It was a matter of time before he went off the cliff.
Good thing his parents never let him watch cartoons as a kid.
Relativity is a theory. Gravity is a law!
The GPS is acting up again!
What was it you said he invented? Velcro?
They say going down can be as dangerous as climbing up.
Walking on water's already been done.
The audacity of Velcro continues to astonish me.
Nah, downhill's too hard on the knees.
Whatever you do, don't look straight!
Well this is a cliffhanger.
Think that's impressive? You should see him text and drive!
Just suspend your belief in the laws of gravity and go for it.
I told you we should have warned him not to follow the Google maps directions.
I should have backed that Kickstarter, too.
This is where we lost Billy.
He goes low, we go higher.
I said take a flying leap.
I told you it was risky joining a club called The Lemmings.
He attributes it to diet and exercise.
I told you he was very tacky.
You're doing fine. Just don't look down.
I recommend we do not continue to play 'follow the leader'.
I think he's calling it Velcro.
Falling in very slow motion is still falling.
Perhaps we shouldn't mention it.
I've seen this cartoon. In about two seconds either he's going to fall or we are.
He says the GPS is always right.
He's inclined to get down.
Impressive, but it's just showing off when he does it backwards.
No one ever told him he couldn't.
Never hire a guide whose nickname is Gecko.
But what if he trips?
"Water is too easy".
Yes it's impressive, but wait till you see him moonwalk it back to us.
It's a Zen thing, mind over mountain.
The amazing thing is "He's walking up backwards"
Trust me, I've seen this in other cartoons.
Remind me to update the GPS if we get back.
Yeah that's pretty good but I bet it won't be as easy on the way up.
I'm not taking the fall for this one.
I hope his laces are tied.
Clarence, cheer up! It's only a presidential election!!
His spirit animal is Wile E. Coyote.
On second thought, I guess you can change the laws of phsyics.
Do you think we should tell him the path ended?
Oh, gross, Frank. You stepped in some gum.
He's never seen a Road Runner cartoon.
He's taken 'cliffhanger' to a whole 'nother level.
Let him go. You know Professor Lemmings has a mind of his own.
How'd you like to walk a mile in his shoes?
Walking down is easy. Let's see if he has the stamina to walk back up.
Do you think he can walk on water too?
It's how you look at it.
It's easier going downhill.
I told you he couldn't rappel!
Looks like he found the fastest way down.
He dropped his phone
Joe always finds a short cut.
He makes it look so easy!
Why do you think his parents named him, Cliff?
Should we tell him, "walking on water" is what really got people talking?
Talk about a race to the bottom.
Escher wait! This is real life!
It's just Escher being Escher.
There's gotta be a Trump joke in here somewhere, but I'll be damned if I can figure it out.
He said he stopped eating gluten.
This proves it. We're figments of someone's imagination.
Where the hell can we get shoes like that?
He swears by his GPS.
Either he's escaping reality or his pack really is lighter than ours.
Does he know there's a bridge?
Is this a bucket list, or a fu¢# it list?
He always thinks he knows a short cut...and I bet he beats us to the bottom.
Wilderness guide, my ass!
I don't care what WAZE says, I'm going back the way we came!
It actually helps if you look down.
Tom has always lived in a perpendicular universe.
I'm getting too old for psychedelics.
He puts too much faith in the directions his GPS gives him.
Do you believe this guy? The park ranger said to stay on the marked trail.
Pete failed physics!
"I'm not sure he understands the gravitas of the situation." Lisa Erickson, Minneapolis, MN
He's off his meds...
I'm telling you, EVERYTHING is rigged.
Now I KNOW we're in a cartoon!
Those boots will be huge on Kickstarter.
I saw Fred Astaire do that in 'Royal Wedding!' Bravo!
Now that is gravitas.
Sometimes you just have to follow your own path.
Of course, he only does this so he won't have to carry the heavy bags
PokemonGo meets the older generation.
I guess he wasn't joking when he said this was the quickest way to the bottom.
His superpower is Circe du Soleil.
Escher's stairs weren't enough of a challenge for him.
Should we follow him and the rest of the Trump supporters?
Did he say where he gets his shoes?
I think we are off the trail
He says it's easy in landscape view.
Billy was raised by Goats
I can't remember what, but Mom said something about this exact situation.
If you think that's great, wait till you see him on that river.
He is the only guy I know who moonwalks up a cliff.
I have a feeling we shouldn't have taken the one less traveled by
Spider-Man, Schmider-Man.... Parker, quit goofing off!
He says, he's determined to reach rock bottom.
He marches to a really different drummer.
The brochure for the tour said that the excursions were somewhat challenging
His mother had an affair with Spiderman.
I'd rather take the scenic route.
Pffft, you should see him dance on the ceiling!
Told you he was blind.
Relax, we're millennials - we don't believe in gravitas
It's a giant leap of faith to deny climate change to denying gravity!
Lets try this from a different angle
When they say "If your friend went over a cliff, would you follow?", this isn't what I had in mind.
The new banned substances' list comes out after the fall.
I guess that works if you can walk fast enough.
A guide, you said. Can't do this without one, you said. You happy now?
I'm afraid he's taken a turn for the worst.
Where's the downside?
I know his boots were expensive but that's ridiculous
I can hear the lemming inside you wanting to go next.
What do you expect? He totally bombed Physics in college.
He was right -- those hiking shoes were worth the money.
I think he said, 'follow me.'
I've looked all over for a pair of boots like that.
If he leaves his phone in the car just one more time I swear I'm not waiting.
I knew his lack of gravitas would be his downfall.
Now there's an idea with some traction!
So far so good
I'll be darned, those butt-clenching exercises really do strengthen the gluteals.
It's all easy and downhill from here.
Escher is such a show-off!
Would you walk down a cliff if all your friends did?
He seems unbalanced lately.
You know what, you guys brainstorm all you want. I'm going to just start walking.
Zen is only going to take him so far.
It's all downhill from here guys!
Maybe we're the ones who need to do a reality check.
Ah...so, that's why they call this place The Gray Cliffs of Velcro.
Perspective is an illusion.
Hi Ho, Hi Ho...it's off the cliff I go!
He still hasn't reached his daily step goal.
And don't come running back when you finally understand the gravity of the situation.
Can a cartoonist face reckless endangerment charges?
They say he has great gravitas.
Puts a whole new perspective on things, doesn't it?
I admire his perspective.
He said, "Newton, Schmooten."
Don't worry - he's done this before.
He takes going off the grid to a whole new level.
He just upgraded his GPS.
This is the last time we go hiking with Escher.
another victim of the GPS grave yard
I've got to get a pair of those boots.
Don't worry, it's all downhill from here!
I've gotten turned around--which direction is horizontal?
He teaches relativism at Stanford.
Please stop ignoring the gravity of your situation.
He's horizontally challenged.
I don't always hike, but when I do I prefer zero gravity.
He's always looking at things from a different angle.
Is that how he gets his selfies to come out in landscape?
He told us if she won he was leaving the country.
I'm not falling for that trick.
Later, when we freeze frame the Go-Pro, it will look like he's walking down the rock face, instead of actually falling to his death.
He claims one of his ancestors used to argue with Newton.
I don't think I brought the right shoes for this.
You always said you'd follow him anywhere
He said "Because it's down there."
I could do that too if I had those shoes.
Stay on the Heath, Cliff!
That's why he's the CEO.
Trailblazer my ass...
You want to tell him the shoes aren't really magical or should we wait till he gets to the bottom?
He bought those boots from a wily coyote.
Harry and his goddamn out-of-the-way restaurants.
Hopefully this is just a metaphor.
I didn't realize he was taking the "walk down" part of "How many roads must a man walk down?" so literally...
He is making gradual declines great again
Logically, I was sure it was a slippery slope.
I voted bridge.
M.C. Escher goes mountain climbing
The obit can begin "He strode with such assurance..."
Has he gone over the edge again?
This guy doesn't know which way is up.
He says he'll be ok if he doesn't trip.
I told you it was all downhill from here.
Do you seriously not get the gravity of the situation?
Dang Google Maps.
Dang! He's right about the fly paper!
I guess the GPS unit was right after all.
Damned GPS.
He's so libertarian that he won't accept the law of gravity.
"Of course, he's slow. He's walking backwards.
Apparently there's a Pokemon down there.
The compass said south
...yeah, so I'm going to walkabout my ass back to the lodge.
He always did have the ability to follow his own inclinations!
You're holding the map wrong! It says 'turn left' at the edge of the cliff!
It's a matter of perspective
Now there's a guy that knows how to "get down"
That's the quintuple double diamond trail. Only for the highly obnoxious hikers.
He just heard Hillary is leading in the polls.
Looks like he doesn't mind that it is all downhill from here.
Looks like that spider was radioactive after all.
Although I wish him well, I can't help feeling it's all downhill from here.
Now I see why he was raving about those new boots!
I guess he really wants that Pokémon.
He said something about early voting.
Didn't Fred Astaire and Donald O'Connor do something like that?
Onwards and downwards, as he always said.
I feel over the hill, too. I'm just coping better.
Just like you to go off and leave us stranded here.
Apparently, the trick is not looking down.
The perils of Pokemon Go.
You know, sometimes I don't like that guy.
The new president suspended that law too?
I take it back -- he's *not* vertically challenged.
This will revolutionize cartoon physics.
We should have been more concerned that his trail name is Lemming.
There goes the scientific consensus on gravity.
That's one small step for a man, one giant coup for National Geographic
Heigh ho, Heigh ho, it's off the cliff we go.
I didn't think he was serious when he said he wanted to 'live on the edge'.
I guess he's over the hill.
You just HAD to invite the extreme sports nut to our bucket list!
WHERE did he buy those hiking boots?
Dan's leadership style is both his best and worst attribute.
Miracle schmiracle. The best part is can finally tell my mom, “Well, as a matter of fact my friends DO walk off the edge of cliffs, and NO I DON”T follow them.”
Just because he's the guy who invented 'Trickle Down' doesn't guarantee he'll survive.
Nobody ever said playing Pokemon Go wouldn't be dangerous.
The last thing he said was, 'I'll be alright. This artist always signs his cartoons in the bottom left corner.'
He says gravity is just a politically correct hoax.
He's always looking at the downside.
He's a transcendentalist.
It must be the shoes.
I think we'll stick to the trail.
I wonder if he can walk on water too
He says he just imagines himself in a magazine and turns it horizontal.
This Pokeman thing has really gotten too far.
He never believed Newton.
Mind you, men like him don't live the long life.
Guess Newton was wrong...
He's off again on the road less traveled by.
I guess it all depends on your perspective.
Nah, I'm going to vote for Hillary.
I don't think that was just granola he ate.
Extreme hiking sounded fun, but I'm walking down.
Now do you believe me when I tell you we are in a cartoon?
Grimsley believes gravity is a hoax
He swears by Waze.
Let him go, he's been on edge for days.
Henry's total reliance on Google Maps would lead the expedition to disaster.
He's in the zone.
And down here we have the bottom of the cliff.
He also walks on water.
Nice shoes!
He'll bounce back, right?
You never stop and ask for directions!
IT'S GOING TO BE A STEEP LEARNING CURVE
I told him not to eat that mushroom.
He's a founding member of the Earth is Flat Society.
How big do you think his dick is?
For George, some things are suggestions not laws.
He never stopped to enjoy the view.
Sir! Watch out, your shoelace is untied!
I said he was over the hill, but he's not falling for it.
I don’t think his GPS is working.
Be careful not to slip on those loose rocks
There are quicker ways of getting down there.
I don't know which way is up these days either...
There goes Ralph again, defying every law!
He'll wake up, briefly.
Do not attempt to adjust your vertical hold, this is the twilight zone.
'He always marched to the tune of a different drummer.'
Remember, mind over splatter!
I told him he needed to get a grip.
I don't think he realized Over the Hill is just an expression...
He's a cartoonist. That's how!
Will you be back for dinner?
He always says Google maps is never wrong.
Who knew you could suspend belief in gravity?
He said he was with cirque de soleil
Man down.
Don't you just hate it when they end on a cliffhanger?
Seriously, man, for Pokémon Go?!
But I'm afraid of depths.
He wanted to come here, to Iron Mountain, because people keep commenting on his unusually high degree of personal magnetism.
He said his name was Cliff Walker.
I'll bet you 10 dollars he won't be back."
If he's on the level and we're not, what do we do next?
Pffft, I would be more impressed if he walked up it.
I admire his confidence in his GPS.
I need better boots.
So that's why he's called Cliff
OK. Didn't see THAT coming.
Bridges? He don't need no stinking bridges.
I told you not to invite him.
He was bitten by a radioactive mountain goat.
Careful, Sidney, don't run.
Hey guys, this looks like the easiest way down.
What the hell is this 'Tipperary' he keeps singing about?
You have a warped sense of humor Peter Parker.
That settles it. Bob gets tested for PEDs.
Wait! Where in lieu of flowers?
His shoes are the new Teslas. He's laced in and goes wherever they take him.
Now I know why they named him "Cliff."
Don't! We take it back, we won't vote third party!
I always thought he was a lemming.
I told you hiking with M. C. Escher could be frustrating.
If you think that's impressive, you should see him when he does it backwards.
His GPS said there is a road here.
I think one of us may be turned around.
This is a matter of some gravity!
Come see us when you can walk on water.
And you guys didn't think I could make it up backwards!
George has always been light on his feet.
Holy cow, he was right about those non-skid soles
Those shoes are worth the extra money!
I gotta get me a pair of those hiking boots!
Stupid. How are you going to get back?
You're overthinking this.
Sam just doesn't get the gravity of our situation.
I told you we weren't qualified to do the intermediate trek.
Shoes wisely.
Impossible? Are you kidding, he also thinks Trump can win!?!
Hey, I thought we were a team!
This is why I don't want to walk with Jesus.
Well you don't have to leave in such a huff!
"And *that*, my friend, is what you call a real ''cliffhanger"!
When you gotta go....you gotta go!
That's not an approved trail, Hank!
...because it's dangerous to wake a sleep walker.
Ah, yes, the 'Slippery Slope' fallacy ... good demonstration, Dr. Cornblatt!
He's a Libertarian .
Now I see why you like your new hiking boots so much.
Yeah...but can he part walls?
My oh my, he has totally lost his edge.
Wall Street tax attorney discovers loophole in law of gravity on team building weekend.
I want his hiking boots.
Watch out for that banana peel!
For the last time - we are NOT going to follow you to hell and back!
As long as nobody fact-checks gravity, we'll be fine.
But we're supposed to stay on the posted trail.
No, Frank, I don't understand the gravity of our situation.
If you think that's impressive, you should see how he goes to the bathroom
I didn't think "anti-establishment," included gravity.
When we go high, he goes low!
Those shoes suck.
Einstein is rolling in his grave.
I hope he doesn't fart .
His conspiracy theory about 'scientific consensus' extends to gravity.
Gravity isn't a hoax created by China, trust me.
Man, Wile E. Coyote would have killed for a pair of boots like those.
What do you propose Doctor Lemming?
Even in retirement, Captain Kirk wanted to boldly go where no one had gone before.
Call when you reach the bottom Harry!
Sam, when you return with the ropes could you bring some lip balm, too? Only if it's not too much to ask.
Why is he humming 'Climb Every Mountain'?
He does seem to have his own reality.
Was it something I said?
He learned this trick from Trump. His reality was whatever he says it is.
He says it's the shortest path to the bottom.
The walking sticks do help with balance.
I'm having second thoughts about these company outdoor adventure retreats with the boss. Mankoff is as blind as a bat without his glasses.
I've heard about those who take the road less traveled...
Son of a gun! Showing us up again by traversing up backwards.
And if you order now, we'll throw in a second tube of Wonder Glue absolutely free!
He's using the new iBoots.
He has a flagrant disregard for the laws of gravity.
I've got to stop taking acid before a hike.
Since Donald Trump was elected ALL the rules have changed.
Ninety percent of physics is believing in yourself.
Yeah, descending is always easier than ascending.
I think there's too much downside to that trail.
Cliff just earned his name
How else did you expect to get back down?
Look! It's M.C. Escher!
And just what does that prove?
Thank goodness he wasn't in 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.' That was the best part.
That's why it's called M. C Escher mountain.
They don't call him "El Capitan" for nothing.
Since he read Robert Frost, , he's been taking the road less traveled.
He wouldn't have been able to do that before he lost all the weight.
I liked him better when he was in a downward spiral
Hey, old-timer, don't leave now. We climbed all the way up here to ask you the secret of life.
Sure, we're all in the same party, but do you really want to follow him?
The first step is usually a killer!
He's watched way too many Roadrunner cartoons.
Exactly what kind of spider bit him back there?
But how will you get the shoes back up to us?
He loses more sherpas that way.
Honey, why cant you be more like Robert?
I once saw Fred Astaire do something like that in a movie!
And when he gets to the bottom he walks on water.
It's a camera trick from the old Batman episodes.
The Early Bird buffet price isn't worth it!
He is sick of being told what he can and cannot do.
Now I know why he was chewing so much gum earlier.
How do you think he got to be CEO of Wells Frago.
Ok. We admit going down was impressive. Coming back up? Now you're just showing off!
He always sticks with his GPS.
Save your breath. He's an idealist.
I think Bob is taking his study of Lemmings a bit too far
Shh, don't say a word; as long as he believes...
Yes, but he is the unconventional, straight-shooting outsider we were looking for in a leader.
All he said was, 'Don't buy everything Sir Isaac Newton wrote.'
Don't look down!

Hey Bobby you didn't tell us you took the advanced class, we haven't learned how to do that yet.
He's taking this Robert Frost walking tour a bit too literally.
Ted, okay, I'm sorry I said 'You couldn't walk down this mountain if your life depended on it!'
He said something about a spider bite.
Lem, we should have followed him to that new shoe place...
See anything down there?
He says we are about to fall off the mountain.
Where did you say you met this guy again?
He always takes the short cut.
Burt thought he left the oven on
He prepaid for a gravitational anomaly.
Darn you,Isaac Newton/
Paul, come back. The caucus loves you.
Try not to think too hard about it, that only ever gets us cartoons in trouble.
He brings another dimension.
Way to stick it to virtual reality.
So how many REI employees do you think it takes to screw in a lightbulb?
Your supposed to stay on the trail!!
Extreme showoff.
He's certainly a true trailblazer.
Is that Cliff Walker?
It is all rigged!
He has great quads.
I thought he said "Check out my spider, man."
All I said was that Trump should release his tax returns.
Sometimes it's like generation-y operates on a whole other plane.
I'm neither a leader nor a follower.

I'm telling you, the view is better up here!
There he goes again, trying to make all the difference.
It’s good to know he’s still putting those Spidey-powers to use.
Looks like he was right about it being mind over gravity.
He's always been a downside kind of guy.
Peter Parker can be really annoying in retirement.
He said he lived south of here.
He is not defying gravity, he is living it.
Damn Car Keys
He's such a showoff.
I'm growing a beard.
I knew the superglue would dry.
Okay. You proved you are the best mountaineer. You don't have to moonwalk.
He wants his travel time to be off peak.
OK, so he didn't implode by Christmas, and he did win the primary. But he is definitely going to plummet the next time he says something racist, sexist, or Islamophobic.
I hope he appreciates his staff.
He always knows a shortcut.
Wait for us when you reach the bottom.
Because it's there, is not a good enough reason, Simpkins.
contact us if you find a Wi-Fi hot spot!
Of course that first step is a doozy, but as you can see it's simple for Simon.
What's a muggle?
That's not what I expected when I told him to take a hike.
I need those boots.
do you think he can do that on water ?
Stop showing off Fred!
Go ahead Larry, click on "Rotate Counterclockwise" once more; I dare you!
I don't care if he is Tenzing Norgay's son.
I don't think TURN HERE meant go there!
he's never late.
60 is the new 40. B.A.S.E. walking is the new B.A.S.E. jumping.
Hiking keeps him grounded.
I changed my mind. I’ll take a diet soda.
The people in the cartoon control nothing. The person drawing the cartoon controls everything
Wow, those new shoes from LL Bean are amazing!
He's fine, but I'm starting to slide backwards.
Maybe he's spotted the Red Sea down there.
He saw "Singin' in the Rain" recently!
Unfortunately, pushing him over didn’t work.
Dude! Where did you say your dad got those shoes?
Should we tell him what gravity is or do we let him do his thing?
Oh, very cute, smarty-pants, but don't expect Fred and me to help you back up!
Can you imagine if everything just went black right now and we had to wait for months to find out what happens?
That's why the call him the goat.
Well, at least he's not jumping... Should we go too?
They don’t call it Magnetic Mountain for nothing.
Oh c'mon. Really?
the trick to not falling is pretending to walk backwards
'Barophobia' was never in Ed's dictionary.
Now I recall why I hate going for hikes with Max.
Well, go ahead and follow him; what are you waiting for?

Hey Corrigan,make a U-turn!
He's an accountant. Swears by the declining balance method.
Do you think he can also walk on water?
Come back! We love the name Sherpa.
Don't worry. It's an optical illusion. He's actually on top of the mountain. Oh #$&^%!
Careful, that river's mighty deep.
His name is Flemming, but he dropped the F.
If your friend walked off a cliff with appropriate climbing gear and footwear, would you?
No worries... I’m come from a long line of lemmings.

He was always known as an upstanding man.
Uh, yep, he’s gotta be one of John Muir’s descend-ants

Hang in there Cliff!
What exactly did you put on those s'mores?
He's trying out for "Americas Got Talent".
Yeah? Well, you know, its easier to go down than to come back up.

It's all in the mind, Jack.
Now who do you want to lead?
I can think of an easier way to prove Newton's Third Law?
We don't have to take the fastest way down

Shhh. Don't break his concentration.
I told him to find a short cut but this is over the edge!
Bill has a sleephiking disorder.
Sure I could -- if I could afford $950 for a pair of hiking boots.
If all it takes is faith, you go first!
I don't care how much experience he has hiking in this area, I'm not taking that shortcut.
He's just showing off his new app
Walking backwards up cliffs was never my idea of fun.
Go take a hike!
Perception is everything!
Do you think my cutting the net below was an accident or a subconscious rebellion against his overweening self-confidence?
What did you expect? It's Moses.
Do you think he is using the same gravity we are using?
I am not a Lemming.
That's nice. But can he fly or walk on water?
He always makes some obvious move to mask his fear of heights.
Stay one with the cliff.
i'm afraid jonathan has reached his horizontal limit
Should we email him or text him?
Are you *sure* M. C. Escher didn't draw this?
His ‘temperament’ will be his downfall.
Here comes Olaf, climbing up backwards again.
I can't exactly say he's unbalanced …
That's not what I meant about downsized risk.
He must be Australian.
Let's find a different way down.
Trek or Tweet
We should pay homage to a George Price cartoon from November 1938: 'Sure-footed little beast, isn't he?'
I should have paid that extra twenty dollars for a pair of those boots!
Stephen Hawking needs to hear about this.

you need a very light backpack
Haven't you guys ever read Robert Frost?!
I'm not going down there, I'm afraid of depths!
This Week's "Where Are They Now" features Donald O'Connor....
Wow!""Heard he used to be a cartoonist for the New Yorker.

I used to look forward to Election Day.
I don't know...something about that move just seems over the top.
Wish I had invested in a hot air balloon backpack too!
He won the debate.
He paid an arm and a leg for those boots.
Do you think it's the shoes?
That's one way to ride out the fiscal cliff.
It would be more impressive, if he was heading uphill.
Do you think he's listening to a different drummer?
He said, "No worry, as long as I follow Trump"
Attaboy Fred, gravity ain't got nothing on you.
He is going to hell and back.
How do we get down?
Now I regret sleeping through the "Magical Cliff Walking" part of orientation
Isn't he the same guy who walks on water?
What the very faithful believe happens when you ignore science.
Now those are anti-gravity boots.
It's easy. Take a selfie video with your camera turned sideways.
I think he trust his new boots just a little too much!
He's read all of Carlos Castaneda books.
OK, but can you moonwalk across the kitchen?
You can be a real show-off sometimes, Spider-Man.
Don’t care if it is in the neighborhood, Frank. We’re getting an Uber.
Frank always did have his doubts about gravity.
The last thing he said is ' the shortest distance between two points is oops'......
Do you suppose he was absent the day we studied about gravity?
See, I told you Newton was WRONnnnnnnn
I hope he remembers to bring back donuts with the coffees.
Did the board approve this?
He forgot his phone.
He won a Gold in the Olympic Downhill Walk
He'll never make it back up.
"It's something about a new theory of his".
His certainty is such that mere facts cannot dissuade him.
Hey, maybe next time one of us should take the bag with all the ropes.
His DNA is 25% fly.
I've never mastered that backwards climbing style, but it seems to work for him
He's out to prove the world is flat.

Hey Larry, I don't think south is the right direction.
He's a real trail blazer.
Something tells me he packed too light.
He's got the new Chuck Jones sneakers.
I guess the altimeter on Fred's GPS stopped working.
Whereas I respect his position, I don't plan to be a followe
Leave it to Bob. He never did respect gravity.
If Harvey makes it down ok, we'll patent those new crampons. If not, well I guess it's back to the drawing board, dang it!
Hawkins is always bragging that he is better hiking downhill than uphill.
Hey Gus,where did you buy your walking stick?
This shortcut is pretty steep.
I suppose that you would just hike off a cliff if your frends did,
I thought he said he could do that backwards.
Watch out for the bad patch!
No wonder he ate such a light lunch!
Now I see why he got a shoe contract.
He tells me the GPS behaves funny at this altitude.
I agree, he does have an exceptional grip.
Low percentage, but it's literally the only way off this thing
Roger! Cliff surfing never ends well!
He is an incurable pessimist. Always looking at the downside of life
Did you find out what shoes he was wearing?
He did say those boots were made for walking.
They say there are many paths to the top of the mountain, but I guess there's only one path down.
Now that's what I call a short cut!
I really want a pair of those boots!
Well..it's not the fastest way down.
He always manages to escape the downside risk.
But I think this is better than walking on water.
Did he proclaim, 'Simon says...'?
It's quite a cliff hanger you got there.
He doesn't believe in gravitational theory.
Sure, downhill.
See, I told you he's lost.
He's old school when it comes to gravity
I hate his guts!
Old Joe failed physics
Did we reach a consensus on this?
We never imagined this in the primaries.
I told you to pack light.
I got this.
His new boots seem to really make a difference.
Don't worry it's all down here from now
He loves deconstructing long-held ideas
Elmer should sell that sticky stuff he puts on his boots.
I believe his name is Jesus H. Lemming.
Well done Herbert. Those Octopusoles are going to revolutionize mountaineering.
He obviously thinks horizontal is the up-and-down one.

That Patagonia chewing gum really does work!

Whoa, the new iGrav boots really work!
Be careful on this next trail, a lot of people fall.
We should have called an Uber.

Cliff's pissed because I told him he couldn't walk on water.
I guess he did graduate from Sherpa University.
Harold does not believe in gravity.
This caption might end on a cliffhanger
If you're looking for gravity, it's this way.
Don't try it. He has the new anti-gravity boots from L.L. Bean.
You've got this!
I always wondered what I would do at this moment...
It's a good thing he remembered to put on his clean socks.
No, I don't think it matters that we won the bet.
I hate it when Grandpa Parker shows off.
Our friend's walking, not jumping, so I'm pretty sure Mom would say it's okay.
I'll tell you what, Lemming, go ahead if you want, but I am going to double back to the camper.
I need some of those new shoes.
See? I told you that you were being an alarmist.
Onward and downward!
Well then...right now we either have to follow him or hang on to that tree.
Mr. Lemming seems to be very determined
I gotta say, I'm inclined to follow him. He doesn't sound like a politician when he gives directions.
Now he's broken EVERY law of nature.
That's Barry. Always thinks he's better than us.
hey! the uber just arrived - wha do you want to do?
He says a straight line is the shortest distance between two points.
Honey, I think it's time to have that father-son talk about gravity.
I gotta get me a pair of those boots
His trail name is M.C. Escher.
I don't think you'll catch those lemmings that way Dan.
He can't help it, he's such a show off!
He believes the world is flat.
Let’s face it…Frank is just a stick-to-it type of guy.
Wow, looks like those rubber retreads really do work
He promised to get down and send a Helicopter for us. I forgot to pin the note to him in case he falls...
He's a real cliffhanger.
Are you -- ah -- sure, Pa?
I like pumpkin spice donuts too. I'm just not willing to die for them.
Even in high school he never understood the laws of gravity.
We're here to be awed by the miracles of nature. Not to look down on our fellow man.

If you turn the page 45 CW we can follow him
O Capitan! My Capitan!
Hey! You forgot your glasses!
Hmm, I know he's our leader but my app sends us in a different direction.
Whatever you do, don't think about gravity.
Any problem with your microphone?
Huh! He must have auto-rotate.
I'm ready to turn around.
Talk about being over the top.
Well, this certainly isn't the metaphor I was expecting.
Fred has been eating too many Cliff bars
He has the magnetism to walk down mountains with ease.
Way to go Magellan!
The good news: the sides are magnetized. The bad news: the world IS flat.
And that's why he's known as the world's foremost lemming scientist.
He's on the fast track, but to where?
I said, 'I no longer think of him as an upright man!'
Does crossfit once.
We wore the wrong shoes!
I think he takes the notion that walking is controlled falling too literally!
Maybe he wasn't just bragging about all the squats he does.
Failed Psych 101. . .no depth perception.
They weren't falsies after all, they were suction cups!"
You know what? I'm hungry. I think I saw a McDonald's 350 miles back.

I told you-he's not MY friend.
He felt that the Everest ascent would be too demanding.

Damn, I wish I had listened to him and bought those boots!
It's the shoes, Man! It's the shoes!
Can you do that backwards?
I guess the upgrade to 'premium' walking stick did pay off!
There he goes, sleepwalking again.
He won't get far that way.
He guarantees it will make hiking great again.
Yeah, he acts like he can walk on water.
Three's a crowd anyway, let him take a hike.
A DNA ancestry test revealed he’s 8 percent arachnid.
This doesn't seem right
The future in four words ... helium backpacks and shoes.
Normally he starts from the bottom up but thought this would be faster.
Nice shoes! Works well with that outfit, don'tcha think?
The anti-gravity movement states that gravity is "just a theory"
What did you do? Tell him to take a hike?
It's all relative, really
When you said lets go see the Old Man on the Mountain, this is not what i expected...
Brilliant, he's bucking the trend once again.
Looks like his internal compass needs adjustment!
He wasn't kidding about the wall.
Don't forget about this gravity concept.
This Nimbus 2000 walking-stick is great!
I wonder what's wrong with me; I can't think of a Trump joke to go with this.
Before you criticize us, walk a mile in our shoes.
What's your compass reading?
Why did we ever make him scout leader.
Those Velcro soles are really impressive!
Well, that's one way to do it!
Wow, it looks like Frank does not know the basics behind gravity.
well, he did describe himself as an edgy hiker.
I knew his views slanted away from conservatism but this is a whole other level.

He's always been a downward thinker.
He chose this path rather than vote for Hilary or Donald.

The somewhat less disastrous "blind leading the sighted" scenario.
I told you Phil wasn't a fall guy." OR "There goes Bob, ignoring the gravity of the situation.
Give the roadrunner my regards.
What does he mean 'walk this way?'
You just had to brag about the steepest trail you ever took.
Dude, you did it! You grew a beard!
He grew up living amongst geckos
He love, love, loved Michael Jackson.
He tends to get huffy when you criticize his beard.
Can't you walk any faster?
I'm not sure if I used the right coefficient of friction on the shoe design, but I guess we'll see in a minute.
Jeremiah’s disdain for regulations extends even to the laws of science.

...and it was then that I realized I had to have a pair of those Hhimalayan Sherpa hiking boots, $149.99 in brown or black, sizes 6 to 18.
It's got be his fallen arches!
Aw, shoot, I think we missed the elevator. Whatever, let's just take the trail.
I think your worrying too much , Wile E Coyote does this all the time!
Remember when Mrs. Escher warned us about hiking with M.C.?
Of course, this trail does have its ups and downs.
Not to worry.. We're all post-modernists so none of us has the edge.
Sal, this was NOT in the brochure.
The laws of physics? Rutherford claims he's broken every law in the book.
Have you ever watched a roadrunner cartoon?
Easy, just rotate the picture clockwise!
Thank God he didn't forget his walking stick.
John never did have a grip on reality.
Let him go. The power of belief can't hold out forever.
It's O.K. Some people just aren't as fast at cliff walking backwards.
I know he's a great leader, but I am just not into following today.
Tune in next week!
He walks on hot coals too.
Go ahead and follow. Remember he told us downhill would be the easy part.
I told him to turn South.
Frank you forgot to give us your phone so we can get this on social media
He hates us because we're physicists.
I think I can. I think I can.
Hey, you took my down vest!
For Ted, down is up. He doesn't know east from west either.
He used to deny climate change but now he's convinced granite is a hoax
I thought he only had velcro laces
Hey! Don't you know that you're not able to do that?
Now that's considerable latitude!
I'd be intimidated by the gravity of the situation.
Now how are we supposed to get back?
Good thing he can't see where he's going.
You know, Bob, when I was ribbing him about paying $10,000 for a pair of hiking shoes, it never occurred to me that things might work out like this.
It said on the box, "With these boots you will be able to walk like a human fly!" I just hope he laced them up well!
He is so high right now.
He's practicing skiing post-global warming.
He is not going to be happy he missed his Dr. appointment for sleepwalking treatment

I mean you REALLY can't believe how much weight he's lost.
I thought we agreed I'm bringing up the rear.
My spider senses are starting to tingle. Yours?
We shouldn't have let Peter Parker lead this hike.
He said he new a short cut.
See, I told you we should have bought our boots at REI.
Escher! Get back here!
I told you he couldn't walk a straight line.
Just because walking down cliff's is the new trend doesn't mean you should do it.
Walking backwards only works on the way up
Frank, you are about to be Down and Out.
New boots...Acme.
I think he's headed to the other side.
That trail is for the sure-footed.
Way to walk on the edge, dude! We're going back to the truck, now.
I bet he's got an infinity pool.
Don't look directly in front of you!
He's not a mountain climber...he's a sole man.
He hasn't fallen for me yet.
It's all in the glue ---- and prayer.
Rock, paper, scissors?

Funny thing is he's a flat-earther.
He says this is easy - just don't look down.
Am I really the only one who got the Horizontal Walking badge?
Big Deal, lots of people can moon walk up a mountain!
He said that it is faster to take the shortcut.
When I said " let's take a shortcut " I didn't mean that.
He's either very dumb or very skilled!
Alzheimer's makes you fearless
no, we are falling. This is supposed to be a landscape photo.
...but what about if your friend walked off a cliff?
'Walk this way'.
He does that with his cell phone
Wouldn't mind walking in HIS shoes right now...
Everyone brags about reaching the summit of a mountain, but the descent is much harder.
I find walking downhill is always harder on my thighs.
He's always showing off.
I get the skill thing, but the showing off seems unnecessary.
He lost weight!
Surely the Republican party can do better?
I suppose his next feat is going to be walking on water!
He's taking a more contemplative approach to suicide
As usual, John was the last one to moonwalk up the cliff.
Of course, you volunteered to go next. You'd follow Brad just about anywhere.
Dude you are pulling a Trump, Your Progressing Downwards!"
The grammarian is looking for the difference between 'decent' and 'descent'.
How he does it without ropes and anchors is simply amazing.
He's actually a lousy mountain climber—always forgets the rope.
He walks everywhere backwards
He never looks at a map.
When he picked up the white stick, I figured he was our leader
Guess we owe him a Coke.
Soon he'll be running on the Libertarian ticket.
These novice hikers don't even know which way is up.
Walking off a cliff must have been one of the advanced classes.
"Actually, he's scaling down everything in his life." [Note: "everything" should be underlined]
I do have faith, I am only wondering why we are not falling backwards.
Magneto shoes were the right choice for the Iron Mountain hike.
We all thought he couldn't do it...
Okay, we give, Richard. Nobody's trekking pole hangs lower than yours.
Jesus and his water-walking got nothing on this guy...
watch your step its slippery down there
Next time I see an email with a subject line about crowdfunding anti-gravity shoes, I just might open it.
He has always had sticky feet.
Okay - this calls for a decision.
Well if you start feeling better, we'll be up here all weekend.
Nobody will see this caption, so... FART FART FART FART!
C'mon Gary, it was 15 years ago. Stop being so dramatic!
He is the master when it comes to thermals.
His beard resists gravity.
I hope he's thought about the fact that he has to climb back up.
Let us know when you discover gravity.
Harry has such willpower, but not a lot of smarts.
Oh, his name is Peter Parker.
He now lives life over the edge.
He told me he's going sideways because upside down would be too hard
Come back Harry. You did NOT leave the garage door open!
That lucky dog inherited Arnold Palmer's golf shoes.
He's got new L.L. Bean boots.
He's being over dramatic in his impression of how 2016 is going
He was always very impatient.
Wow! Those inversion boots are really versatile!
Quit showing off Billy!
Rotate right.
I thought he was muttering that stupid meme about the "box", but it was really about "thinking outside the rocks"!
He's lost his bearings.
Hold on a minute Joe! Goin' down is one thing-remember, you have to come back up!
He swears that's a great cure for acrophobia.
President Trump has repealed the law of gravity.
Hey, where are you going? The trail is over here.
Well . . . I guess better him than us.
Can he walk on water?
He's always been a bit off.
I made him an offer he couldn't refuse.
Shall we drop him your apple ?
Last time we get Peter Parker as a guide.
HE'S REALLY LIVING ON THE LEDGE.
He has no fear of the law.
Where's Waldo?
He's been telling me he was a fly, but I thought he was just off his meds again.
I still say it's safer to take the Uber Drone back to camp
Why yes he was a Navy Seal.
Wish I'd thought of that!
Fred has become insufferable every since he climbed the Matterhorn.
He's taking the shortcut!
Jeremy always wanted to live in a perpendicular universe.
He is trying to prove Newton was wrong!
I should grow a beard
It's what lemmings would do if they could.
I knew he'd be too scared of heights.
Ignore him, he's an antigravity show off
I'll give you a Cliff Bar if you go next.
Just when I felt accomplished doing a strenuous hike.
He decided to take the Longitudinal Path...
He should have gone potty before we left.
Dang ... you shouldn't have made that $100 bet
Seriously, Bob? Mucilage?
Now I believe he has recovered from his chronic vertigo
It all started last month after he was bitten by a radioactive Ibex.
I think the theory on gravity just took a turn.
He always wants to do things the hard way!
Because it's not there.
He learned about gravity from a Facebook post.
It must be that gum Bob stepped on last week on Broadway. He was only able to scrape off half of it
