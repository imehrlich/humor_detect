378,1027,3,9,54,66,1.2272727272727273,0.06403471722070707,596,It's really not MY health we should be toasting.

3781,1063,0,14,50,64,1.21875,0.052083333333333336,596,Why not? I can always get an Uber.
3800,1063,1,12,51,64,1.21875,0.05664543544843536,596,"I don't want to sound grim, but I prefer to drink alone."
3869,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,Why not? It won't kill me.
3904,1063,5,4,55,64,1.21875,0.07206130960001936,596,"Thanks, but not when I'm working. Did you happen to notice your ex in the parking lot?"
3940,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,"Nope, and I don't pay taxes, either."

4018,1063,1,12,51,64,1.21875,0.05664543544843536,596,It's really dark. You'll like it.
3773,1063,2,10,52,64,1.21875,0.060866551595885596,596,Nah...One more'll kill me.
4401,1063,2,10,52,64,1.21875,0.060866551595885596,596,That stuff goes right through me.
3943,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,"Well Jasper, when I say ""Time Gentlemen"" it has a slightly different meaning."
3771,1063,4,6,54,64,1.21875,0.06853320797422294,596,This beer is to die for!
3395,1063,4,6,54,64,1.21875,0.06853320797422294,596,"Naw, beer just goes right through me."
3678,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,You the socially responsible guy who called for Uber?
3667,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,Is that light beer?
3660,1063,4,6,54,64,1.21875,0.06853320797422294,596,Here’s to the economy!
3112,1063,2,10,52,64,1.21875,0.060866551595885596,596,"No, I don't want to take your last one!"
3580,1063,4,6,54,64,1.21875,0.06853320797422294,596,I suppose one beer wouldn't kill me.
3532,1063,4,6,54,64,1.21875,0.06853320797422294,596,"Hey Slim, let’s drink to your health."
3509,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,That's the spirit!
3441,1063,2,10,52,64,1.21875,0.060866551595885596,596,"Man, I'd not kill for a beer!"
3229,1063,0,14,50,64,1.21875,0.052083333333333336,596,"No, thank you. I'm on duty now."
5870,1063,2,10,52,64,1.21875,0.060866551595885596,596,"stick around, happy hour's a killer here"
3166,1063,5,4,55,64,1.21875,0.07206130960001936,596,Here's to hoping you're wearing a costume and not a uniform.
4421,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,"No thanks, buddy, that stuff will kill you..."
3735,1063,1,12,51,64,1.21875,0.05664543544843536,596,Not for me. I’m the designated scyther.
4494,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,"Yeah, you don't recognize me do you?"
5436,1063,1,12,51,64,1.21875,0.05664543544843536,596,Have one! Don't be a killjoy.
4520,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,"Let's skip the first part, and just toast to taxes."
3102,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,"Go for it. What is chugging two beers going to do, kill you?"
5736,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,Did you hear the one about the guy who dropped dead at last call?
5724,1063,1,12,51,64,1.21875,0.05664543544843536,596,Let's drink to a swift end to 2017!
5654,1063,2,10,52,64,1.21875,0.060866551595885596,596,Thanks. I'm in the mood for a cold one.
5621,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,"C'mon buddy, get a life!"
5613,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,You're late. Beer?
5586,1063,1,12,51,64,1.21875,0.05664543544843536,596,"It’s just that my wife is cheating. And if anything happens to the guy, she’ll know it was me."
5535,1063,2,10,52,64,1.21875,0.060866551595885596,596,Flirting with Death.
5484,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,Here's to 'what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.'
5386,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,"You DO realize this is not a Halloween costume, right?"
5284,1063,2,10,52,64,1.21875,0.060866551595885596,596,"Relax, it's the bartender's job to announce last call."
5257,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,And Happy Last Year to you!
5222,1063,2,10,52,64,1.21875,0.060866551595885596,596,Is it a frosted mug?
5184,1063,2,10,52,64,1.21875,0.060866551595885596,596,...and another just like it if you take her damn dog too.
5134,1063,2,10,52,64,1.21875,0.060866551595885596,596,"Have a seat, I've been waiting for you."
5060,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,Here . . . you look like you need this more than I do.
4942,1063,2,10,52,64,1.21875,0.060866551595885596,596,"Ah, what the hell."
4877,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,"So, one drink won’t kill you."
4855,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,"Look, man. Just because you're feeling grim that doesn't make us brothers."
4837,1063,1,12,51,64,1.21875,0.05664543544843536,596,"Hey fella, why so grim?"
4822,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,"The way I figure, it sure beats dying alone."
4750,1063,4,6,54,64,1.21875,0.06853320797422294,596,"No thanks, I'd rather die"
4740,1063,6,2,56,64,1.21875,0.07542455891353682,596,Thanks. Next bier's on me.
4699,1063,4,6,54,64,1.21875,0.06853320797422294,596,"I said I'm buyin', not dyin'"
4621,1063,2,10,52,64,1.21875,0.060866551595885596,596,No drinking when I'm on the job.
4513,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,"Sure, what the heck -- the wife keeps telling me to be less grim."
3082,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,I would but I'm gluten free.
3227,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,"When the barkeep shouts, 'Last call!' I better take him more seriously."
2987,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,Last one? If you say so.
1615,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,"You just missed 'last call', buddy."
1554,1063,4,6,54,64,1.21875,0.06853320797422294,596,Trust me. You need it more than I do.
1403,1063,5,4,55,64,1.21875,0.07206130960001936,596,One last pint before we go???
1380,1063,1,12,51,64,1.21875,0.05664543544843536,596,"Like I always say, ""there are no strangers, only friends I haven't met yet."""
1332,1063,2,10,52,64,1.21875,0.060866551595885596,596,Let me buy you a beer. Ive been dying to meet you.
1239,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,No thanks. Happy hour really isn't my thing.
1236,1063,4,6,54,64,1.21875,0.06853320797422294,596,No no I can’t... I’m waiting for a Donald Trump
1095,1063,4,6,54,64,1.21875,0.06853320797422294,596,Don’t think buying me a drink means I won’t leave with you.
1079,1063,4,6,54,64,1.21875,0.06853320797422294,596,You're too late but you can have his beer if you want.
969,1063,2,10,52,64,1.21875,0.060866551595885596,596,Why don’t you try living for a change?
897,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,I'm afraid we're cutting you off
675,1063,2,10,52,64,1.21875,0.060866551595885596,596,"Sure, why not drink to your health?"
570,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,Join me for a bier?
466,1063,2,10,52,64,1.21875,0.060866551595885596,596,"' Last call' ? Well, if you insist."
427,1063,2,10,52,64,1.21875,0.060866551595885596,596,One of us will have a good year.
350,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,Why so grim?!
269,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,Your generosity will be the death of me.
187,1063,5,4,55,64,1.21875,0.07206130960001936,596,"Thanks, but I need to stay sharp."
178,1063,2,10,52,64,1.21875,0.060866551595885596,596,"My friend, that'll buy you a day."
157,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,Another guy offered me ‘White House Chief Strategist.’
134,1063,4,6,54,64,1.21875,0.06853320797422294,596,You might as well drink both.
55,1063,1,12,51,64,1.21875,0.05664543544843536,596,Good thing dead men tell no tales. My wife would kill me if she knew I was here.
39,1063,2,10,52,64,1.21875,0.060866551595885596,596,"No thanks, that stuff'll kill you."
20,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,No thanks-- I'm trying to cut down.
3032,1063,4,6,54,64,1.21875,0.06853320797422294,596,"""No thanks, I'm looking for a bier""."
1619,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,Now THAT'S a 'last call'!
1629,1063,2,10,52,64,1.21875,0.060866551595885596,596,Here's hoping it's Halloween.
258,1063,2,10,52,64,1.21875,0.060866551595885596,596,Here's to the last last call.
1685,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,“Bottoms up?” I’ll pass that along to your undertaker.
1635,1063,1,12,51,64,1.21875,0.05664543544843536,596,"I am supposed to take you with me at 5, but sure, why not, its not 5 o'clock somewhere."
2953,1063,3,8,53,64,1.21875,0.06481333851304336,596,Normally I don’t feel like death until the next morning.

4217,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,No thanks. Any more and I’ll lose my grimness.
4133,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"Thanks for the beer, but why do you want me to chug it?"

3046,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,One for the road? How thoughtful!
3038,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,I'll buy you a beer if you promise to end this year early.
3018,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Thanks pal, but tonight I'm the designated dier."

2991,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Here's one for the road, or wherever we're headed."
2948,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"It's cold. You like cold, right?"
2931,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"You know Happy Hour's over, right?"
2908,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,Here's a 'cold-one' for the Doppelgänger of a guy who showed up last year right before Harry 'passed-on'.

2884,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,"Hell, you look like you could use a drink."
2878,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,Thanks. My day's been pretty grim.
2867,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"Just the one, thanks. I gotta get to the First Amendment rally out in front of the White House."
2857,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Nah, haven’t touched the stuff since Prince."
2854,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,Let me get you this beer; you look dead tired
2851,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,I don't drink. I reap.
3003,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,"No thanks, it would be the death of me."
3691,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"I would, but I already have two strikes for ""ferrying under the influence""."

3297,2114,3,2,45,50,1.16,0.0720544012166771,596,"C'mon, would it kill you to have one more?"
3670,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,Last call on me buddy!
3668,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"No thanks, I can finally drink absinthe"
4508,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,Can I actually get some hard liquor? I’ve had a killer day
3637,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"No thanks, I hear it's not good for you."
3633,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,"Sure, it's last call, after all."
3627,2114,3,2,45,50,1.16,0.0720544012166771,596,"Look, buddy - it's rush hour. We're not going anywhere."
3625,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,No thanks. I never reap and drive.
3617,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,I might as well have another since you're here.
3591,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Aw, c'mon. It won't kill you..."
3576,2114,3,2,45,50,1.16,0.0720544012166771,596,"Thanks, but I don't drink and scythe."
3561,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,Cheers to that shiny flag of your!
3537,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"Try this, these guys make a killer IPA."
3531,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"No, you go ahead."
3289,2114,3,2,45,50,1.16,0.0720544012166771,596,"I heard it was Last Call, so I got you one for the road."
3530,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"No thanks, I'm watching my weight."
3495,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,This is most definitely your last call!
3427,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"I heard that hoods were back in style."" ""You still look like death!"
3398,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,"Let's have a beer, and I'll give you some names."
3385,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"Thanks anyway, I've already had 2 Zombies."
3377,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,It won't kill ya
3370,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,You gotta try this drink! It's killer.
3340,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,One last drink?
3338,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Have a drink buddy, you're looking a little grim these days."
3327,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,Thanks. But I never drink while working.
3318,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"No thanks, it goes right thru me. Enjoy."
3307,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"No thanks. And by the way, that was your last call for alcohol."
3306,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,Thanks. It's been a killer day.
3304,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,"Hey buddy, why the grim face?"
3503,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,Trade ya.
4510,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,"I'd kill for a beer. Well, not literally."
4566,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"C'mon, one hasn't ever killed anyone - or has it?"
4524,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"It's not a ""let's."" It's a ""you're""...toast."
5511,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,"Don’t be so grim, buddy. Here, have a beer."
5465,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,I can use that. I've been in a spiritual crisis since the Trump election.
5461,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,"Aw, go ahead- it's not that kind of bier."
5459,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,"""To second chances!'"
5452,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"No, I meant we should get a bier together."
5450,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,Yeah OK. You've got time for one more.
5447,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,Lay off and this one's on me.
5446,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,I only come here for the appetizers.
5441,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,Drink up! It's all you can drink for the next 5 minutes!
5431,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,I had what he's having
5425,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"Here's one for ya, laddie. Don't look so grim."
5414,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"No thanks, I’m scything tonight."
5412,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,They're both for you! I'm driving.
5402,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,Hey ol' pal how did the x-rays go?
5401,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"I'll have another, but only if you drive."
5399,2114,3,2,45,50,1.16,0.0720544012166771,596,"No, thanks. I'm just waiting 'til you drive home."
5396,2114,3,2,45,50,1.16,0.0720544012166771,596,"Here, take Pete's, I don't think he's coming back."
5381,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"I'll drink mine, but you might want to order yours 'to go'."
5370,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,Thanks- but I think I'll remove the head first.
5354,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,Till we meet again!
5333,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,I am drinking to a buddy. Maybe you know him.
5325,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"No thanks, I’m just here for the salmonella."
5321,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,For a second there I thought you were my wife ... now that would've been REALLY bad!
5311,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,C’mon man. One more won’t kill you.
5308,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,Lets drink to a long life.
5300,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,Let's just say I'm a people person.
5295,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,A final one for the final road?
5526,2114,3,2,45,50,1.16,0.0720544012166771,596,"No, Thanks. I gave the stuff up years ago after a health scare."
5558,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"Thanks for the offer, but I'm still on the clock."
5573,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,Are you certain this is Happy Hour?
5598,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,What'd you say your name was? Jim Reefer?
2846,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Ah, come down and join me. It won’t kill you to have one beer with me."
5897,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,"Check it out, this brew is killer!"
5886,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Hey, beautiful, how 'bout one for the road on me?"""
5867,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,You and your scythe aren’t going anywhere after you taste this pumpkin spice IPA.
5861,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"Hey, come on - it'll put some meat on those bones."
5859,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,Cures what ales ya!
5854,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,"Sorry, I can't drink while working...."
5845,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,Drink while you wait?
5826,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"Well, I suppose I could have just one…"
5816,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,Won’t you join me?” “I was just going to ask you the same.
5814,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,Normally I wouldn’t make this trade but I could really use a beer.
5803,2114,3,2,45,50,1.16,0.0720544012166771,596,"Hey Bannon, you're looking down man, this one's for you!"
5798,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,...and don't worry: You won't be needing a bathroom.
5287,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"Please keep drinking, i am on duty !"
5776,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,Not till I've finished both!
5767,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,Right. Nothing is certain except death and now tax reform.
5735,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,I heard you were interested in near death experiences.
5730,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,why not? I'm dead already.
5722,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"Yes, thanks. I will join you but remember you can only die once."
5717,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,Move any closer and you'll be drinking alone.
5711,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"No thanks, buddy--I can't be drinking and driving you to Hades."
5684,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,Final final?
5650,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"Not now, thanks. Rules say: If you drink don't reap."
5637,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"No, thanks. I'm on call."
5631,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,Have them both--Bill can't make it.
5626,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,"Sure, to whatever tomorrow does not bring."
5624,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,You look like you need a bier.
5602,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Here, have my extra beer. You just missed last call."
5771,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"Thanks, human. I have something for you, too."
4512,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,Here. Kill it... if you can.
5277,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,I only drink dark beer.
5272,2114,3,2,45,50,1.16,0.0720544012166771,596,You look down in the dumps...have one on me.
4868,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,Of all the gin joints in all the world...
4867,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,"Well if you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em."
4862,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,The last guy who offered me one for the road ended up at the front of the line.
4861,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,What makes you think it's poison?
4857,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"Hey, Pal, join me for Happy Hour!"
4850,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,A toast to Trump's demise.
4819,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,I hope you're not expecting me to be the life of the party.
4818,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,Are you sure? It’s last call.
4806,2114,3,2,45,50,1.16,0.0720544012166771,596,I'm his designated driver.
4794,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"You know, you could be the Happy Reaper."
4746,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,Could I interest you in one more for the road before we go??
4738,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,It's IPA--Interment Prevention Assurance.
4735,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,Still in your Halloween costume?

119,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,Thanks. I'll buy the next 20 rounds. I hope my replacement has a better year next year.
112,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Because I could not drink for death, Death, kindly drink for me?"
111,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Actually, I prefer martinis--bone dry."
107,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"No, thanks. Can't you see I've had one too many already?"
103,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,"Cheers, Man this last one’s gonna kill me."
89,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"No thanks. I'm on duty, Mr. Kelly of 508 Joshua Lane."
72,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"Thanks, but I'm on duty - you might want to chug yours."
50,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"Ok, just one more before closing time."
43,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,You can blame the new thermostat settings on our seasonal helpers.
37,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"Sure, why not? I've been dying for a cold one all day."
2799,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Rough year, dude? You look like you need this more than me."
259,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,OK we'll have one the long road.
264,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,It's always one for the road.
274,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,No thanks. I'm here for the atmosphere.
276,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,I'll just die if this isn't the best beer you've ever tasted.
589,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"The good news is, you won't be charged for the beer."
572,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,I’m here to kill all the poor people that only spend their money on booze.
552,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,Don't be so grim. Have a beer.
541,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,You may as well drink this....I don't think I'm going to have time for a second one.
530,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"Have a drink, it won't kill you."
528,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,Ma always said to kill 'em with kindness.
494,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,My day was a killer. Yours?
491,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"Thanks, I've been dying for pint all day."
483,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"C'mon. Have one more drink, it won't kill you."""
481,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,That brew might just buy you another five minutes!
478,2114,3,2,45,50,1.16,0.0720544012166771,596,Here's to tax reform and making America grim again!
469,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,Same deal as last year?
431,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,No thanks. I’m the designated dier.
1350,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Enjoy, we are all doomed anyway."
429,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,So what if your time is up. It's on me!
404,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,You think YOU have an Angry Orchard?
402,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Is it last call, already?"
397,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,Uh... You didn't hear me say Last Call?
394,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"Cheer up, Buddy  ""Cheer up, Buddy! I mean it's not like somebody died, right?"
381,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Here's to the worst last call, ever."
359,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,Stop being such a Debbie Downer and have a beer.
354,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,"No thank you, that stuff will kill you."
345,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,"Salute! Being self-employed isn't as easy as it looks, huh?"
322,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Okay, but this is last call. Deal?"
316,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"Here, have a drink, you look like death"
294,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Why so grim, have one on me."
284,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,One drink won't kill you
277,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Okay, just one more, then we have to get back to business."
412,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,You sure as hell cleared out this joint.
1357,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,"Here, have a beer while I show you lots of photos of my ex-wife."
445,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,I know this trick. You get me drunk and then you steal my scythe.
1382,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,I figure it won't kill me to buy a stranger a drink.
2356,2114,3,2,45,50,1.16,0.0720544012166771,596,"It's made with water from Flint, Michigan but I'm sure you don't mind."
2339,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,Good call. It's senior discount day.
2337,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,I never drink on the job.
2334,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,That's cheating.
2333,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Here’s to ya, Mr. Bannon."
2332,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,Come and join me. It’s dangerous to drink alone.
2310,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,Join me for last call?
2291,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Okay, you have convinced me, you need this brew much more than I do."
2290,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"No thanks, I'm a designated driver."
2289,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,Thanks. I'll pay you back sooner than you think.
2279,2114,3,2,45,50,1.16,0.0720544012166771,596,"No thanks. You drink them both, I'll buy you another, then let's go for a drive."
2276,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Here, have one. You need it as much as I do."
2267,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,I'd say you pay your tab right now.
2258,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Thanks, buddy! I guess one more won't kill me."
2779,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Cheers! You just made my day. So, what brings you in here tonight?"
2244,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,Thanks. I'll get you later.
2242,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,C'mon. One beer won't kill you.
2234,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,You look like you've had a killer week.
2228,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,Just because you're afraid to be alone doesn't mean you have to keep following me.
2226,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Well may you say ""It's Miller time!"" but I'm casting my net a little wider."
2218,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,I'm a huge blue oyster cult fan too!
2211,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"The rent’s sky high, my kid needs bail money, and my car got swiped. But at least I made a new friend."
2207,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,No thanks. I don't have a stomach for it.
2178,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"So, new in town? Me too. Here's to a long life!"
2158,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,Tough Day? You look like you could use a beer.
2137,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,You want one for the road?
2127,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,Drink up while you still can.
2383,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Whoops, my friend was here a minute ago."
2423,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"No, Fred! Your wife is still going to kill you when you get home."
2465,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,dilly dilly
2490,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,I'm coming! I'm coming! I just need to finish these beers.
1372,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"Don't look at me like that! Come on, let's celebrate my life!"
2777,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,Fake brews?
2775,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,Koufax....'65...382 K's....pay up!
2764,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,OK then one for the road
2761,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Here's to a life, well... lived."
2759,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
2745,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,Time for one more?
2741,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,I guess you've got time for one more.
2735,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Cheer up, its not so grim."
2715,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"No thanks, I'm a spirits kind of guy."
2709,2114,3,2,45,50,1.16,0.0720544012166771,596,It's okay. I posted fake pictures too.
2705,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Thanks anyway, but I don't drink while I'm working."
2697,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,C'mon. One drink won't kill me.
2125,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Yes, I will have one for the road. After all, it is last call."
2693,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,No thanks-- I'm stone cold sober.
2656,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,I'm not going anywhere until I finish my beer.
2652,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"That's a pretty nifty Halloween costume you got there, buddy....but I've seen better."
2638,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"When they said last call, I had no idea it was not just for tonight"
2628,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,I knew there had to be a catch.
2623,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Ask not for whom the beer foams - it foams for thee."""
2605,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Here, it won’t kill you."
2578,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Regrettably, that's not the bier I had in mind."
2556,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,Want to see me lop off all the heads with one swing?
2554,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Have a beer, Grimmy. The guy on the floor is in no hurry."
2545,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,Join me in one for the road?
2522,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"No thanks, last time you talked me into too many, and you got a reprieve."
2515,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"NO, I literally can't hold my beer..."
2510,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,Here you go. Let's drink to my health.
2671,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,No thanks. You drink it.....but don't forget your car keys.
2093,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,"You don’t need to pry this from my cold dead hands, it’s all yours!"
2246,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,Ask not for whom the beer foams...
2084,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,Nice costume. Let's drink on it.
1736,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"Here, you gotta try this brew -- it's to die for!"
1728,2114,3,2,45,50,1.16,0.0720544012166771,596,"C'mon, one beer never killed anyone."
1726,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,You indulge?
1724,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,Happy hour? Sure...if you'd like to call it that.
1701,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,Drinking can impair your judgement. Joe was about to find out the hard way...
1697,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"This is for you -- I figure if nothing stops you, one drink sure won't."
1695,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,I operate heavy machinery. What do you do for a living?
1670,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"No thanks, I'm fine. That stuff goes right through me."
1665,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,Why so grim?!
1641,2114,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,596,"Drink up, and you won't look so grim."
1640,2114,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,596,"Yes, ‘Hoppy Ending’ is a great name for a microbrew, but in this case, it’s also a bit ironic."
1637,2114,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,596,"Come on have a cold one, I know we can work this out!"
