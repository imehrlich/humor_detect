4520,2329,1,12,87,100,1.14,0.037658754867650863,629,"I though they said I’d be hanging out with rock STARS, not stairs."
4461,2329,3,8,89,100,1.14,0.04268749491621898,629,"then I said, 'I'm NOT starting at the bottom and working my way up'"

4023,2329,2,10,88,100,1.14,0.04025173313289776,629,I’ve got a real foot fetish.
4050,2329,3,8,89,100,1.14,0.04268749491621898,629,"So THAT'S why they call it a ""rock face""!"
4074,2329,1,12,87,100,1.14,0.037658754867650863,629,"Farley, you wanted your picture on the wall."
4084,2329,1,12,87,100,1.14,0.037658754867650863,629,Is this about my fear of heights or your fear of your ex?
4099,2329,2,10,88,100,1.14,0.04025173313289776,629,"Darling, your mother and I would like you to come home."

4152,2329,2,10,88,100,1.14,0.04025173313289776,629,Ever since we broke up you've been climbing the walls.
3929,2329,1,12,87,100,1.14,0.037658754867650863,629,I feel like a stepping stone in our relationship!

4227,2329,2,10,88,100,1.14,0.04025173313289776,629,"Believe me, it wasn't easy."
4245,2329,0,14,86,100,1.14,0.03487350880197769,629,My ex always said I was just a stepping stone boyfriend.

4286,2329,0,14,86,100,1.14,0.03487350880197769,629,"Uh oh, there goes another marriage on the rocks."
4311,2329,3,8,89,100,1.14,0.04268749491621898,629,"I wanted to hold your hand, Janet, not be a hand-hold."
4354,2329,1,12,87,100,1.14,0.037658754867650863,629,"I was going to call, but..."
4385,2329,1,12,87,100,1.14,0.037658754867650863,629,So I found myself between a rock and a hard face.
4412,2329,2,10,88,100,1.14,0.04025173313289776,629,"It's OK, I get hazard pay on ladies' night."
4440,2329,2,10,88,100,1.14,0.04025173313289776,629,What did you think a face ascent meant?
4177,2329,1,12,87,100,1.14,0.037658754867650863,629,I can see your house from here!

4158,2329,0,14,86,100,1.14,0.03487350880197769,629,I realised I don't like heights.
2604,2329,2,10,88,100,1.14,0.04025173313289776,629,This is not leaning in.
905,2329,1,12,87,100,1.14,0.037658754867650863,629,You can step on my head.  It's the other side of the wall I'm worried about.
937,2329,1,12,87,100,1.14,0.037658754867650863,629,"Go ahead, I'm just your stepping stone."

1206,2329,1,12,87,100,1.14,0.037658754867650863,629,"They tell you 'This job: rocks,'  but they don't say it that way."
1220,2329,2,10,88,100,1.14,0.04025173313289776,629,It's better than minimum wage.
1239,2329,3,8,89,100,1.14,0.04268749491621898,629,This neighborhood has really gentrified quickly.

320,2329,2,10,88,100,1.14,0.04025173313289776,629,I heard someone say there's a dart bar next door.
349,2329,4,6,90,100,1.14,0.04499158170416354,629,Definite presidential material---and he's branded this wall!

441,2329,1,12,87,100,1.14,0.037658754867650863,629,I suppose you're wondering why I asked you here today.
553,2329,2,10,88,100,1.14,0.04025173313289776,629,This is where I fell from grace.
555,2329,1,12,87,100,1.14,0.037658754867650863,629,...then the Genie asked me what my last wish was and I told her I just wanted to be closer to you...
582,2329,0,14,86,100,1.14,0.03487350880197769,629,"Hey, it’s a job. The tips are good but the pitons are problematic."
