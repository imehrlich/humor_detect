Long time no sea.
Long time no sea.
Noah, trust me. Its over.
Do I LOOK like I have any Grey Poupon?
I'm losing confidence in Google Maps too.
No thanks; I get seasick.
Thanks, but I get sea sick.
Have you seen two guys and a drum majorette?
You may not think so, but we're in the same boat.
Thanks, but I'd just slow you down.
Well, you do have to admit he was one heck of a salesman.
Are you nuts? I'm not getting in that thing without a life vest!
I see you're still denying climate change.
Michael, you have completely misinterpreted the lyrics.
Actually, we're in the same boat.
The next time a genie offers us a wish, let me do the talking, O.K.?
Working on your heat stroke?
Actually, I do think you're in the same boat that I'm in.
Thanks, but we're already in the same boat.
On your mark, get set...
Do you believe in climate change NOW?!
I don't think a dry run was a good idea.
You're not from around here, are you?
You're ashore, already Michael, you're ashore.
Yeah, so water gets drawn out in a tsunami. So what?
I've had enough of your dry humor.
Let's consider this a dry run
This is what happens when you drain the swamp.
I thought it was just going to be a problem for like, polar bears.
Now hallucinate some water.
No, I didn't call for an Uber.
You do realize that throwing me overboard does not change our situation?
'We should go off season' you said. 'It's half the price and there's no crowds.'
After my dune buggy flipped, I never thought I'd be rescued.
I hope you realize you're completely neglecting your lower body.
It's not as deep as I thought
Michael, you've already rowed the boat ashore.
It's not as deep as it looks.
I said to get us an off road vehicle, not an oft rowed one!
For God's sake, please stop yelling 'man overboard!'.
Stop saying "on your left."
It's a lot warmer once you get in.
If you let me in the boat we can use the HOV lane.
No, YOU'RE a mirage
One of us is in the wrong cartoon.
You have the whole desert...did you have to row right where I'm swimming?
You say "But it's a dry heat" one more time...
I don't tell you how to row so stop telling me how to swim.
You know we're in the same boat, figuratively speaking.
I am pretty sure the shark problem is behind us.
You don't throw your navigator out for one little mistake!
I find your optimism disturbing.
I think this is a case of either oar
One of us is in the wrong cartoon.
Maybe we shouldn't have drained the swamp.
On your left!
I'm here to tell you an inconvenient truth.
Don't blame me, I voted for Al Gore.
We're duned.
I was hoping for a better hallucination.
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily my ass.
The guy in the kayak is about two hours ahead of you.
No, YOU'RE a mirage
Aw, man, right through my sand castle.
Merrily, merrily my ass!
Are you just going to leave me here to drown!?
You're up a paddle without a creek.
Next time you have a choice, pick the camels.
I followed Siri. What's your excuse?
You can stop rowing, Michael. We're ashore.
Thank you for coming to rescue me
One more Merrily, Merrily and you're a dead man.
Thank goodness you showed up. I've been treading water all day.
Do I LOOK like I have any Grey Poupon?
Watch your wake, buddy!
I still think a gym membership would've been better.
I don't care what Google Maps says!
I told you a camel would be a better investment!
Seriously, you're my Uber?
So this is what you meant about a dry run.
We are not going anywhere until I find that lens.
I told you that was a stupid third wish.
I don't believe in global warming either.
What do you mean, there's a weight limit?
I didn't think he would really drain the swamp.
I can't. I get seasick.
Give it up, Michael. You are ashore.
Can’t you see we’re in the same boat?
Have you seen a majorette leading a marching band?
But it's a dry heat.
You aren't from around here are you?
Well, we drained the Swamp...
I know you said it was a dry run.
No, no. You've got it backward. I'M supposed to wander here for forty years. YOU'RE supposed to wait until it rains for forty days and forty nights.
I'm telling you Pete, we were going faster when I was in the boat making motor noises
Yeah, I think I see land, too.
No! You come in on 'Merrily, merrily!'
Make that row versus wade joke one more time and you'll be sorry!
Say "merrily" one more time. I dare you.
Permission to come aboard?
If it weren't for global warming, I would have drowned!
Who drained the swamp?
Michael, you've rowed your boat ashore. You can stop now.
No. We're not all in the same boat!
Is that a sun stroke?
Maybe it's time to admit that we're lost.
Thanks for the offer, but I get seasick.
At least it's a dry heat.
I can't find your stupid contact lens! Can I get back in the boat now!
Merrily, merrily, merrily, my ass.
"Would you stop humming the music to Jaws for God's sake!
Michael, you've rowed your boat ashore.
I hate to break it to you, but the 'ship of the desert' is a camel.
Thanks, but I'm makin' pretty good time.
He sure drained the swamp fast.
You think you're hallucinating? I'm drowning here!
Didn't you hear me yell "man over board"?
No. We're not all in the same boat!
It's just a song, Michael.
It took you long enough to get here.
This is nothing. In the 70's I traveled through this area on a horse with no name.
No life vest? Are you crazy?
Save yourself Jimmy, it's too late for me.
For the last time, I refuse to get on a boat without a life jacket!
Which way to Burning Man?
It looks like we are both using the same GPS.
Even though you say we're in the same boat, we're really not.
Oh sure, just leave me here to drown.
Merrily my ass
Stay in your lane, buddy!
I warned you about draining the swamp.
“The third leg of this triathlon is a killer”.
If you say, 'at least we have a paddle' one more time, I'm going to capsize you.
What took you so long?
I think we're in the same boat
Thanks, but I always get seasick.
We're duned.
Michael, I didn't mean this far ashore.
So, tell me again. Why did you choose the boat over the camel?
What do you mean you don't pick up hitchhikers?
And where does your brilliant GPS tell us to go now?
On your mark, get set...
Rough dunes today.
I think we could both use some water
Where were you when I was in the desert island cartoon?
Face it Larry, you're up the creek without a creek.
No thanks, I'd rather swim.
If you let me back in I promise not to criticize your navigation skills.
Yes, Michael. You rowed the boat ashore. Hallelujah.
No thanks, I have a tendency to get seasick.
Michael, your boat is already ashore.
You climate change deniers just don't give up, do you?
Thanks for the offer, but I get seasick.
If you say, ' Long time no sea' one more time, I'll leave you on the first island we come to.
Don't just sit there, throw me a line!
No thanks; I get seasick.
You have a very dry sense of humor.
You climate change deniers will never give up.
Post-truth world notwithstanding, there is no stream, you're not rowing gently, and I really take issue with "merrily"!
I'm sick and tired of always having to play the shark!
I'll never vote to drain the swamp again.
No, I Do Not have any Grey Poupon?
Permission to come aboard?
Your choice; row verses wade
Why don't you just 'merrily' kiss my ass?
Remember, when the tide comes in we switch.
Practicing your heat stroke?
Welcome to death row.
All I'm saying is that the science isn't necessarily conclusive.
So I guess that flood thing was just fake news?
Kenny, your "man overboard" thing isn't funny anymore.
I think we lost that Drum Majorette
No thanks, boats make me seasick.
Are you just gonna leave me here to drown?
Heat! Stroke! Heat! Stroke!
You plugged DEAD SEA into the GPS?
You're still bending your elbows early.
I don't care if you don't know how to swim; it's my turn to row.
You took forever. Does that mean my pizza is free?
No thanks, I'll swim from here.
Hey, watch your wake I'm crawling here.
No thanks. I have to get in my 10,000 steps.
Still think 'life is but a dream'?
You, again?
Go on ahead. I'll catch up.
Can you give me a lift to the next mirage?
Well if you think rowing in this is hard, try swimming in it!
For the hundredth time, I am not getting in that thing without a life jacket.
Just going to leave me here to drown?
I've heard of a dry run but this is insane!
Do you have any Grey Poupon?
Enough with the "cry me a river" already.
They elected who?!
Let's call it a tie.
Which one of us is imagining the other?
Spoiler alert: Land, ho!
Stop splashing me!!!
How come I always have to be the shark?
Let me say it one more time. "Man overboard!"
Hey, watch your wake!
Are you insane, man? Where's your life jacket?
Well, at least it's a dry heat.
At least it's a dry heat.
Mine capsized last week.
I'll wait for the next mirage.
I thought it was metaphor for something else when he said he was going to "drain the swamp..."
Wow. And I thought my GPS sucked.
Man, you Uber guys are everywhere!
Are you the mirage or am I?
You have perfected the heat stroke.
Mine capsized.
Third climate change denier I've met today.
This is what we get for following that majorette!
"Didn't you hear me yell "man overboard" six miles ago?
I'm not the mirage - you're the mirage!
I'm just not a boat person.
Can we finally admit the climate has changed?
Did Moses say WHEN the sea was returning?
I'll wait for the camel.
Are you any closer to accepting that the GPS might be wrong?
You're scaring the fish away!
Don't leave me! The next boat isn't due for hours.
The lake was more fun before climate change.
What the hell took so long?
No, we are most certainly not in the same boat!
When I called for a ship of the desert, I was expecting a camel.
It's my turn in the mirage
Hey! Quit splashing!
I said, "Man Overboard!"
Final offer, I have two tickets to 'Hamilton'.
Haven't you heard someone yelling 'man overboard' for the past four miles?!?
Frankly, I'd rather be following that majorette from a couple weeks ago!
We're ALREADY in the same boat, so stop telling me to get in!
How far are you going?
Quit complaining, you can't sink and I can't drown.
So what part of "MAN OVERBOARD" don't you understand?
Yeah. The tide's out.
I've come to rescue you.
I think I see land!
Are you just going to sit there or are you going to help me find my contact lens?
One of us is hallucinating.
That’s right, just row away and leave me here to drown!
No! I will not just "get on board".
If I admit to global warming can I get back in the boat?
Have I seen land?!?!
It's your turn to play the shark.
For the umpteenth time...man overboard!
I yell for help and you row right past me!
The next time Moses says he can part the Red Sea, just take his word for it.
Doesn't anyone pick up hitch-hikers any more?
Now do you believe in climate change?
Pardon Me, Do You Have Any Grey Poupon?
See what happens when they drain the swamp?
You're just going to let me drown here?
I may be thirsty, but at least I'm not delusional!
It looked different in the brochure.
Whatever floats your boat, I guess.
Believe it or not pal, we're both in the same boat....
'Let's book off-season.' you said. 'It will be half the price and no crowds.' you said. Are you happy now?
It wouldn't kill you to say 'passing on the left.'
I think we're dealing with something a little worse than low tide.
Moron! Watch where you're going!
Uh, Michael, you're ashore already.
Stop rowing, you're scaring away the fish.
No thanks, I get sandsick.
Thank God you're here! Can you take me to one of those tiny islands with a single palm tree?
Shit creek it is, but you've got a paddle.
Wait...you're not going to leave me here to drown?
Permission to come aboard? Sir
Steve, Moses parted the sea like two weeks ago. Just admit that we're lost!
It's a dry run.
You've taken the song a bit too seriously, Michael."
On your left!
For the last time -- we're not in the same boat!
Let me guess--you must be Michael.
In order to make sure you are not a mirage I'll need to ask you a few security questions.
This " secret fishing spot " had better be worth it !
Didn't you hear he drained the swamp!
You can stop, Michael.
Could you at least throw me a life jacket?
Why don't you go rescue the people stranded on desert islands in all those other New Yorker cartoons?
Could you please drop the 'Merrily, Merrily' bit
Don't you just hate G.P.S.?
And how much for my luggage?
Recalculating!
Do you have any idea how LONG I'd been working on that sand castle?
Trust me, don't drink the sand–it will only make you thirstier.
I refuse to get in there without a life vest.
Will you ever stop reminding me that you rowed at Harvard?
Do I LOOK like I know the way to San Jose?
Let me try the water skis again.
Welcome to death row.
You just had to go back and water the plants?
Hey! I'm swimming here!
That genie screwed us again.
Don’t pretend you didn’t hear me yell “Man overboard!” three days ago.
Oh yeah?! Well you should try swimming in it!
Well, he said he would drain the swamp!
I'd get in but this kind of humor is too dry for me.
Are you my Uber?
I'd walk a mile for a camel
Are you my Uber?
He drained the wrong dang swamp!
Thanks, but I'll crawl from here. I get sea sick.
No thanks! I get terribly sea sick.
For God's sake, Michael, enough already!
It wasn't complicated. I swim the Channel, you watch the compass.
Must you do everything merrily?
I used google map, you?
Dude, you just ran over my sandcastle.
I think this is the definition of "lose - lose"
That's far enough ashore, Michael!
It's not the heat, it's the stupidity.
Stop this nonsense about how climate change might be real. Let's just enjoy our day out on the lake.
You, again?
You said draining the swamp was a good idea.
Enough, Lenny -- it's your turn to be the mermaid.
So it's the journey that counts and not the destination, huh?
I'm starting to get sandsick.
Taking the road less traveled, are you?
Dammit! Man Overboard!
Whoa buddy! This is a no wake zone.
Row v. Wade appears to be a tie
Pardon me, but would you have any Grey Poupon?
Michael, you've rowed your boat more than ashore.
I should have eaten you when I had the chance.
You just had to save 10 bucks on the boat instead of the camel.
No thanks - my Uber is on the way.
Pardon me, would you have any Grey Poupon?
Passing on the starboard side.
Go ahead...say merrily again!
What are you waiting for? Throw me a life preserver.
I thought I called an Uber.
Are you the mirage or am I?
You're outta your element, pal.
I assume you're the new Secretary of Transportation!
You mean I could have been riding this whole time?
Any idea how you say 'un-part' in Hebrew?
Now do you believe in global warming?
Man overboard!
Hey, watch your wake!
Michael! Stop rowing! You're already ashore!
You sprung a what?
Hey, it's a No Wake Zone.
Enough with the "Merrily, merrily."
It stopped being funny 10 miles back.
The heat is making you a little dingy.
Your optimism is infectious. Throw me a life jacket.
This desert cruise looked so different on the website.
Damn it, Über, I ordered a camel!
Still on the fence about climate change?
This is the rowed to nowhere.
I never thought he would succeed in draining the swamp.
Are you that Uber I called?
Im just worried it may tip over with an extra person.
If you let me hop in, we can use the high-occupancy lane.
Are you a mirage...or just stupid?
Of course I need help! I just fell out of the damn boat!
I'm crawlin here!
Thanks anyway, but I already called Uber.
The next dune has the cleanest rest stop
I'm starting to rethink the whole Crossfit thing.
Now will you admit that climate change is real?
Thanks anyway––I'll catch THE NEXT hallucination.
Mind your wake !
I have to say, I admire your optimism.
Still thinking it's a sandbar?
Be careful, you're taking on sand!
Hey! This is a no wake zone.
If this is a sand bar, I'll have a dry martini.
Michael???
Will you hurry up and throw me a rescue buoy.
Stop with the "Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily"
When do we get to the part where life is but a dream?!
No thank you - small boats make me seasick ...
Thank goodness you rowed by. I've been swimming out here all day.
For the last time, stay in your own lane!
At least I'm working all the muscle groups.
You have to row faster or I can't stay up on the skis
Wait till you see the rapids!
You were right, it is too shallow to swim.
Sing it again and I'll kill you.
Best case scenario is that you’re taking on water.
Don't tell me that "We're basically in the same boat!"
Nautical or statute miles?
When I said 'ship of the desert' I meant a camel you idiot!
Uber?
I told you we should have rented the camel but, oh no, you had to save a few dinars
If you reach land, send water.
Keep an eye out for sand sharks.
That's right! Just let me drown out here.
Would it kill you to swim for awhile!
Pedestrians have the right of way!
There's no merrily about it!
No, I'm looking for my contact.
For the last time, the water is a mirage.
Michael, you can stop rowing now.
You idiot. A camel is the ship of the desert.
Um, man overboard, idiot.
No thanks. You know how I get sandsick.
Let me in the boat. I'm tired of swimming.
But I can't swim
If you let me back in, I won't talk about Climate Change.
Man overboard!
I thought camels were the ships of the desert!
Good heavens man! Please tell me you're not my Uber driver!
Do you believe in global warming now?
Michael, you've rowed your boat ashore.
Man Overboard, - Really?
Well, at least we'll come in ahead of that girl on the pogo stick!
Michael, we're ashore already!
Whatever floats your boat.
So you've been seeing water too?
Michael, you can stop rowing now.
What do you mean you're afraid if I try to get in I'll tip the boat over?
I hate low tide.
Enough of the crawl. I'm switching to the butterfly!
Yeah! Well, I can walk on water.
Do you have any Grey Poupon?
Prepare to be boarded!
Does it look like I have any extra sunscreen?
I'm telling you this is not a low tide problem.
I'm still doing my pushups, I'll switch over to the rowing machine later.
You just had to save a few bucks on the GPS.
Pardon me, would you have any Grey Poupon?
Whaddya mean 'I think I can see land.'?
We are not in the same boat!
Slow down, damnit!
You're the 3rd climate change denier I've met today.
It's my damn mirage and I tell you you're supposed to be a mermaid !
Pass on the right, dammit
Now that you've rowed the damn boat ashore, what now Michael?
No thanks, I get sandsick.
It's not the heat, it's the humility.
Heat stroke is a noun, not a verb, moron.
Are you going to just let me drown?
Come on and cry me a river.
You're going to leave me here to not drown?
At what point can we just walk?!
Now do you believe in global warming?
It's your turn to swim.
Enough with the "merrily, merrily, merrily". Life is NOT a dream.
Do I look like I know where the water is?
How do I know it won't sink?
They called this "California."
You had ONE job
" Help me. Please, help me! I can't swim".
I don't think your crew is the only thing that's abandoned you.
Great, even my mirage needs water.
I didn't say "go" yet!
Once we make it to the ocean, we'll switch
At least it's not raining.
Hey! Watch the wake!
What I wouldn't give to be up a creek without a paddle!
One more "Row, row, row your boat" and you're dead!
I'll do it once more but then I'm done making motorboat sounds.
Hey, buddy! Stay in your lane.
You're splashing sand in my face.
Uber?
I know you're not real, but could I have a ride anyway?
Are you crazy? Not without a life vest.
I think I'd rather be up a creek without a paddle.
I hope you sink.
Trust me, I didn't say "get your ship together."
Do you have to splash me?
Let's call it a tie.
Oh no thank you. I suffer from seasickness.
How about an "On your left."?
Okay! Fine! Star Wars is better than Star Trek...now can I get back in?
Would ya quit with the merrily, merrily. This is not a dream.
I told you this was going to be a hard road to row.
Man, looks like you need water more than I do.
Oh, stop complaining. At least you get to work on your core.
At least we're not stuck behind an imaginary majorette.
Let me guess...another climate change denier.
And what exactly is Uber Surge Pricing?
NOW do you think life is but a dream?
You did promise we'd take turns.
Man overboard, damn you!
I am sorry! If you let me back on the boat, I will not say another word about your sense of direction.
Uber, I presume?
Okay, you win. Life is a beach.
Do you think you could stop splashing me?
can you share some of your imaginary water
Stop complaining! At least sharks are no longer a threat.
"What about 'Land Ho!' don't you understand!!?
Michael, you've rowed the damned boat waaaay too far ashore.
On the bright side, we're in no danger of drowning.
Will you be needing a coxswain?
That's quite a dry sense of humor you've got there.
Your technique is not the issue.
No, I Do Not have any Grey Poupon?
Don't splash!
I see you're still denying climate change.
How many bars do you have? My GPS still says "rerouting."
No thanks. I'll wait for the mirage with the land rover.
It's my turn to hallucinate.
You're delusional if you think I can swim.
Give it up, the tide has changed.
Now are you convinced climate change is real?
Are you just going to let me drown?!
For god's sake..throw me a line.
What happened to my regular Uber driver?
And they called me a climate change denier.
Yes, unfortunately, we are still in the same boat.
Hey! Watch where you're going!
No thanks, I'll just keep on swimming.
Why am I doing all the swimming?
I think I'm ready for the Dubai Olympics.
You sir, do not have both oars in the water.
Come on in, the sand's fine.
Don't expect a good Uber rating.
For the love of god, I can't swim
Okay, so what if I say you were right about climate change?
Well Michael, you rowed the boat ashore alright!
I promise I won't get seasick.
Your mirage is obviously grander than mine.
Okay Michael, we're ashore now. Hallelujah.
Are you just going to leave me here to drown!?
Thanks for offering to let me in, but I get seasick.
Did it ever occur to you to throw me a life line?
I know you're in a hurry, but could you help me look for my contact lens?
Why do I always have to swim?
Let me back in the boat Irv, you know I'm terrified of sand sharks.
Ready... Set... Go !
I get it Michael, you've rowed the boat ashore.
I admire your optimism, but positive thinking will only take you so far.
It's my mirage. I should at least get to row.
One of us is lost.
When's it my turn to row? I'm tired of swimming.
No thanks. I get seasick just looking at boats.
You couldn't have used your third wish for a Range Rover?!
Stop splashing me, will ya!
Please, I can't swim!
Don't just sit there, throw me a line!
Stop telling me that it is closer in nautical miles.
If you think the rowing segment is hard, wait until you try to get out of the gym contract.
We landed three miles ago, idiot
They never should've drained the swamp.
Will you please stop shouting Land Ahoy?
Visualize your goal? Really, that's the best you got?
No thanks, I prefer to swim.
When exactly did the tide go out?
Are you here to rescue me?
BOTH contacts?
Face it Jake, you're washed up.
Help, I'm metaphorically drowning!
Stop telling me you can't swim!
I'm looking for water. You?
It's my turn to row now.
Stop singing that song, Michael.
I feel like I'm in a New Yorker cartoon.
OK, the bottom is sanded so now we have to paint it.
So denial isn't just a river in Egypt.
For the thousandth time – you come in on 'Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily.'
I Still Think Bernie Can Win.
What happened to the majorette?
When they said get a ship of the desert they meant a camel!
I believe I have the right of way in this situation.
No, for the thousandth time, I do not want to be the first mate.
Yeah, well at least I'm keeping it real.
Noah, how clearly did you hear that voice?
And bring back a pizza, 6 cheeseburgers, a sack of tortilla chips, ice cream and a Chapstick.
How many more of these desert cartoons do we have to endure?
Deserting me?
Hold on there sailor. This is a no-wake zone.
Drain the swamp?" You said "DRAIN THE SWAMP???!!!
Thanks, but I'm afraid we'd capsize.
I've tried the breast stroke, back stroke, and crawl stroke. Now I'm ready for the heat stroke.
I thought you said the swamp wouldn't be drained until February!!!
Pal, you're lost in more ways than one.
God isn't going to flood the place until you can fit WAY more animals.
Why can't you just admit you made a wrong turn?
Yell "Land Ho!" one more time and I'll clobber you.
Hey, you're taking on sand!
'Sand Ho!
Are you sure we only hit a sandbar?
I tell you having a coxswain would make all the difference.
Permission to come aboard? Sir
You're taking denial to a new level.
How come it's always your turn going downhill?
Yes, I did call for an Uber. What took so long?
Watch your wake, Pal!
This is the first time ever I gave an Uber driver one star.
I have an idea--Why don't we both just walk?
Now, it's your turn to be Moby.
Stop making waves!
Do you still deny that climate change is real?
Keep rowing! It's just past the lighthouse. You can't miss it.
All this way and you forgot the fishing rods??
For the last time, the "ship of the desert" is a CAMEL! THAT'S what I thought you were bringing!
Michael you've done it, hallelujah!
Are you going to just let me drown?
One of us is delirious.
What do you mean you're not my Uber?
Return the GPS.
Michael, STOP rowing your boat ashore!
Do you believe in climate science now?
Do you still think life is but a dream?
If life is but a dream, why can't we merrily get the hell out of here?
I would help you row. but I get seasick.
What's your big hurry?
One of us is delirious.
have you seen two guys crawling behing a batoon twirler?
Is this my mirage or yours?
Wow, that global warming thing just kinda sneaks up on ya, doesn't it?
Do you believe in global warming now?
Michael! You've long since rowed the boat ashore!
What do you mean it beats crawling ?
The good news is we have the paddles; the bad news is no creek.
For God's sake, throw me a life jacket!
Let me guess--your're from the government and here to help me.
Sing one more note and I'm going to merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily punch you in the face.
You call it optimism. I call it denial.
Yeah, yeah---for the millionth time--your biceps are looking bigger.
You know I don't know how to swim!
You can have your rowing machine, I'll stick to push ups.
What, you're gonna let me drown out here?
Metaphorically, we're in the same boat! Will you quit correcting me?
Michael???
It seemed easier before they drained the swamp.
I think you might be even more lost than I am.
Please, I can't swim!
Really? "Life is but a dream?"
We're pretty far up this creek, but at least you have two paddles!
Let me guess... you're one of those 'glass is half full' kinda guys?
Look, I don't mind all the rowing, but that "gently down the stream" crap has got to stop.
The least you could do is throw me a life vest!
Frankly, I'm surprised Uber works all the way out here.
I don't mean to make waves but...they would be nice!
No, I don't want to take a turn rowing!
Do I have any Gray Poupon? That's hilarious, Frank...
What happened to the majorette?
Are you talking to me?
Michael, you can stop rowing, your boat's ashore!
I refuse to sing the word merrily one more time.
I get that Michael rowed his boat ashore, but your name's Barry.
Are you in my mirage, or am I in yours?
Race you to the mirage?
One more chorus of "row, row, row your boat," and you're a dead man.
OK - I think it's your turn to play the shark.
If you are such a good mirage, throw me a rope.
Has 'Man Overboard!' lost all meaning to you?
Slow down, I can't swim that fast!
Don't make waves.
You climate change sceptics drive me crazy.
When did you say the tide was coming in?
I knew Uber would get here
The heat is making you a little dingy.
Pull! You're almost to the other end of the mirage!
For the millionth time: I get seasick!
Excuse me, do you have any Grey Poupon?
No, I don't think we're almost there.
Need a coxswain?
Thanks anyway, but I'll wait for the camel.
Of course it's slow going. You're rowing against the current.
Whaddaya mean life is but a dream?
Are you still denying global warming?
If it was you who dropped the contact lens, I'd be down here helping you look!
Local or express?
Not so merrily, now, are we?
I suppose you're looking for water too.
Michael, I told you to stop once you rowed the boat ashore!
Well, aren't you one big mixed metaphor.
A 'passing on your left' would have been nice.
What do you mean, the sun's making ME crazy? You're the one who didn't bring life jackets.
Are you my mirage or am I yours?
Watch your wake, buddy!
I know I prayed for a ship of the desert, but I meant a camel.
Are you having the mirage or am I?
(in reference to winning caption, Jan 2) Have you seen two guys following a majorette?
Which one of us is hallucinating?
Are you sure the instructions were "One is by sea, two is by sand"?
I just need a lift to my next mirage.
Have you any Grey Poupon?
Michael, you did it!
Watch the wake, buddy!
If you don't stop whistling "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head", I'll kill you.
So what? I can't swim either!
Why don't you crawl for a while, and I'll row.
Come on in, the sand's fine.
Cut it out, Jerry! Would you help me find my contact?
Why do you always get to row?
Watch it there, Buddy! I'm looking for a contact lens here!
Don't give up the ship? Really?
I think we've both gone overboard.
Michael, enough already! You’ve been ashore for hours.
One of us is wrong
No, I DON'T think we should stop and ask for directions.
Nah, I prefer to swim.
Worst fishing trip ever, Paul.
You're gonna wish your life was but a dream.
I tell you, one of us is getting their mirages mixed up.
"Merrily, Merrily." Really? Really?
I'm swimming here!
It's just a guess, but I don't think that waiting for high tide is really going to help
No no no! YOU start singing on the ROW!
Get a grip, Frank. It was just a mirage.
I'm warning you - go ahead say life's a beach just one more time
I said I'm sorry. Let me back in.
Denial ain't just a river in Egypt.
Frankly, you need water more than I do.
Rising sea levels are not our main problem here
Look, our story just doesn't hold water.
Still a climate denier?
My boat sank two days ago.
No wake zone! NO WAKE ZONE!!"
I think I'll wait for an Uber.
I don’t like making waves.
Two if by sea you idiot!
Michael, for God's sake, please stop rowing ashore!
Hey! Quit splashing!
Have you seen the great white camel?
You and your 'short-cut'!
Still a climate change denier?
I'm guessing you don't have any water?
Help me. I can't swim.
YOUR arms are tired?!Try doing the breast stroke for 900 miles!
Race you to the next dune!
Yes, I think it is safe to say our marine GPS system has malfunctioned.
What? No life jacket?
We're in big trouble if I can't find my contact.
Do I have some water for your Dramamine? Seriously?
I'm resigning as your personal trainer.
You promised I could row today.
Thats the last time I let you set the GPS.
You still think the science on global warming is 'unsettled'?
Whaddaya think? Of course I'm the one who called for an Uber.
Sure, a ride would be great. You got a spare life jacket in there?
Are you seriously going to make me swim the entire way!?
OK I made a mistake, now can I get back in the boat?
Stop splashing me!!!
I'm already hallucinating, so stop making waves.
Enough with the dry runs, Howard!
Well Barry, when it's your turn to swim you can make all the dolphin noises you want.
How should I know which one of us is a hallucination?
It gets harder at low tide.
Michael, you HAVE rowed the boat ashore; Hallelujah, already.
I'll believe in climate change when hell freezes over!
There hasn't been an ocean here since 2020.
No, thank you. I like the water.
I'll never book a discount cruise again
Get your boat out of my mirage.
Hey! I'm swimming here!
Well, of course it's easy for you—you don't get seasick.
This is the last time we use Siri for directions.
Who drained the swamp?
You can stop now, Michael.
And you doubted global warming.
No, I will NOT join you for a round of "Row, Row, Row Your Boat."
I'll get back in the boat when you stop yelling 'Land ho!'
"You think I'm the mirage?
Hey! Watch it, pal! I'm crawling here!
Turn back. You're in the wrong cartoon!
Pardon me....but do you have any gray poupon?
NOW, can we call an Uber?
Michael your boat "IS" ashore !
Hey buddy, next time warn people before passing!
Now do you believe in global warming, Bob?
It's a hard road to row.
It's a metaphor.
They said global warming would take longer than this.
I was crawling before you learned to row.
Hit me with that fuckin' oar again and I'll fuckin' drown you.
Help me. I can't swim.
No, I don't have any suntan lotion. Do you have any water?
At least you get to sit down.
Yes, Michael, you've rowed the boat ashore.
Sure, take the easy way out.
Help, ..., man overboard!
Looks like he drained more than the swamp.
Ok , ok, if I promise to stop quoting Nietzsche can I get back in the boat?
Michael, enough !
What time is the next one?
What do you mean your GPS is recalculating!!
When is it my turn with the mirage?
If you hit me with the oar one more time, I'm getting back in the boat.
No thanks. I just called a cab.
Stop singing that damn song!
No, the tide is not going to come in any minute.
Your other boat has a motor?
For pete's sake, the boat will NOT tip over if you let me climb in!
Some triathlon! Next you'll have to bicycle across a lake.
Do you still think life is but a dream?
You're in my lane.
Request permission to come aboard, Captain.
But I had to be Wilson yesterday!
Are you kidding me ... women and children first?
Hey, that's my boat.
Any sight of land?
A little less merrily!
Stop screaming, "Land ho!"
How many times do I have to say "Land Ho" before you stop rowing!?
Which one of us is the hallucination of the other?
Maybe you're stuck on a sand bar ?
Pardon Me, Do You Have Any Grey Poupon?
See, it is you who was high, not the tide.
This is a no wake zone!
I take it you're the camel designed by the committee.
By chance, have you seen a lost shaker of salt?
Denial only gets you so far.
You call that rowing! I could swim faster!
Enough with the 'Land Ho's!
I think we can safely say we've beached by now!
Enough with the merrily, already.
My hope of rescue has also evaporated.
Trump drained the swamp all right!
Hey, mind your wake!
What took you so long? I left that message in a bottle weeks ago!
"There's a marina at the next mirage".
Michael, you rowed the boat ashore!
Excuse me, sir, do you have any Grey Poupon?
It's 'gently down the stream' you imbicile.
WAIT! Will you also pick up some milk?
You can stop rowing now, Michael.
You need to update that GPS
Can't a man get a halfway-decent mirage?
Saved!! I came so close to giving up.
"Great flood," my ass.
Everyone else calls you a mirage; I say you're an idiot.
#DrainTheSwamp
You threw me out to lighten the boat?
No thanks, I'd rather swim.
The brochure said "isolated beach."
I'm guessing another 3 hours to high tide.
On your way to the mirage?
but you know I can't swim'
Showoff!
The scientists never mentioned global evaporation.
Hey, you got sand on me.
You're going the wrong way!
I will not get back in the boat until you admit it's a mirage!
So this is what "draining the swamp" is like.
The name 'Sisyphean Adventures' should have sounded an alarm bell
According to Waze, this is the fastest route.
Hey, I'm swimming here. Go find your own mirage.
Loser buys drinks, right?
One more verse of "Michael, Row the Boat Ashore," and I'll kill you.
No, I do not think a sailboat would have been faster.
Row all you want, but we're in the same boat.
Always showboating.
The STREAM, you idiot. Down the STREAM.
It's your turn to swim.
That "merrily, merrily, merrily" line could be revised.
You here for the timeshare presentation, too?
Excuse me, but I have the right-of-way
Can you at least stop singing that stupid song?
Why couldn't you hallucinate a helicopter?
Are you going anywhere near Secaucus?
George, I'm telling you it IS land!
WHAT?! The mermaid's a MIRAGE?!
Can we PLEASE ask for directions?
What do you mean? - "I'll be back later".
Again - You start singing after I've sung - 'Row-Row-Row your BOAT!' Why is this so difficult?!
Thanks man. Now I'll never find my contact.
Can't we wait until the tide comes in?
You started before I said, 'GO'!
Quick, toss me a life jacket!
Looks like we're both in the same boat.
Grandpa said they privatized the EPA to finance some big wall project
'Gently down the stream,' my ass.
When you get to the oasis, order me a dry martini.
Uber for Sam?
Well, I call it glass half empty.
I know we're not in the same boat, but I do feel we are fellow travelers.
I've perfected my crawl.
Next time, yell, 'on your left.'
If you say 'land ho' one more time I'll capsize you.
Are you...Michael?
Don't you think you're going a little overboard?
"How come you always get to row"?
Do you mind buddy? You just rowed over my sand castle!
Slow down! You know I don't swim that well!
Hey, watch the wake! Can't you see I'm swimming here?
Hey, you wrecked my sandcastle!
I'm looking for my contact lens.
I noticed you slowed down; everything okay?
I'll get back in later. I just want to swim for a while.
It's not about the destination, it's about the journey.
My father crawled through this desert. My grandfather crawled through this desert. What makes you think you can just row on in here.
Global warming my ass.
Yelling 'stroke' won't get us anywhere
Yes, I CAN believe that Arizona is a cheaper than Nantucket in the summer.
Hey, man, are you just gonna let me drown?
Bill, maybe the tide's just out.
You haven't happened to see a contact lens around here have you?
Can you throw me a life jacket? I've been treading sand for days.
Either you're a mirage or I'm a mirage. I'm hoping I'm the mirage.
Quit making waves!
When you reach shore, please send help.
I hallucinate therefore I am.
I told you, we're not rowing one more inch until I find my contact lens!
Not if I have to bail.
Hey, watch it -- I just lost a contact.
No Brian, for the thousandth time, crawling is MUCH better cardio.
I don’t care that it used to be an ocean!
Please let me in the boat, I can't swim!
No, I'm NOT concerned about the tide coming back in.
There are limits to positive thinking, Philip.
Let's face it Bill. Your GPS must be off.
Do you mind? I'm crawling here!
Nope, just a mirage. Let's keep rowing.
Let's switch, I'm getting tired.
Yeah, it’s my new boat and I thought I’d give it a dry run.
Shouting "overboard!" isn't funny anymore, Terry.
"What do you mean we're not in the same boat?
When do you think they will refill the swamp?
Thanks, dumb ass! You just rowed over my lobster traps.
Didn't I see you in a New Yorker cartoon last week?
Because I don't have as good an imagination as you, Larry; THAT'S why!
Look on the bright side - at least you're not up the creek without a paddle!
You want the 'desert island' cartoon, different page.
Still beat a day at the office?
Watch it, pal! This is a no wake zone!
Have you ever trained a fighter before?
Let me guess, you're out of water.
Do you realize that you don't have both oars in the water?
The future of Row v. Wade.
Say 'man overboard' one more time.
When will you global warming deniers admit you are wrong?
For the last time, it doesn't go, "I've been to the desert with the oars with no name."
Watch it! I'm hallucinating here!
You STILL think global warming is a hoax?
It's one thing to be tenacious, it's another to be stupid.
Come on in the sand is great
Hey watch it, I'm crawling here.
At least Trump wasn't lying when he said he was going to "drain the swamp".
Gently? Gently down the stream....really?
I still say climate change is a hoax.
Mine sank in a sand storm!
Is that what they call "death row"?
Mine developed a leak.
Excuse me, when is high tide?
Hey, stay in your lane; you're drifting into my hallucination.
Let me guess – your mirage has water.
Dammit, I spent all morning on that sand castle!
Are we there yet?
I promise I won't be so negative. Can I please get back in the boat?
As dry humor, this just doesn't cut it.
Mirage or not, I'm coming aboard.
I will not go get two of every animal
Michael, I think you have taken this "Row Your Boat Ashore" a bit too far.
I take it this is your first Regatta.
You want me to get into the boat when you do not have any life jackets?
I shouldn't have pulled the plug.
Stay in your lane!
No, the irony DOESN'T delight me.
Hey ! ! ! Watch your wake ! ! !
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily my ass.
So what if I’m NOT the first man to swim across the Oklahoma Panhandle?
You said I could row at the last dune.
No thanks, there's an Uber on the way
Climate change denier?
Permission to climb aboard, Captain?
An optimist would see the boat half full.
It's time to admit it. A boat is NOT better than nothing.
Of course I'm upstream without a paddle !
Hey! No wake zone!
You know darn well it's my turn to row.
Can we talk about something other than your boat for once?
Really? Life is STILL a dream?
This can't be happening; I don't believe in global warming.
I resent everything about your mirage.
You didn't think I could swim, did you?
You should’ve stopped rowing when you hit the beach!
"Recalculate! Damn you. Recalculate!
Wait! Don't leave me!
Did you find my bottle with a note in it?
Can you please stop yelling "stroke?"
Stop splashing sand in my face!
No, thanks. I think I'll crawl.
Can we switch? I am tired of treading sand!
Dang it, Michael. You just don't know when to quit. Do you?
Let's switch, I want to cross train.
Whoa buddy! This is a no wake zone.
So global warming is a hoax!
Hey, thats the HOV lane!
Can I be Captain Ahab and you be Moby Dick now?
took you long enough.
Okay right after I spit underneath the paddle, you row!
Let's switch. You swim. I'll row.
Does this look like gently down the stream to you?
Maybe for you it's all smooth sailing, but for me life's a beach!
I hate Apple Maps.
Watch out for the rapids!
There's a desert island straight ahead.
I'm on the starboard tack. I've clearly got the right of way.
Mike, please. You can stop rowing your boat ashore.
We haven't passed water for days!
Quit showboating, Dave.
Which way you heading?
I told you to bring the damn sail!
My turn to row.
What do you mean 'I don't do transfers'
Of course, you're not tired, you're in the boat!
Don't drink the sand. It will only make you more thirsty.
You're too late. This hasn't been an ocean for 10,000 years.
Hallelujah Michael, you DID get the boat ashore
I still say climate change is a hoax.
It's called "the crawl." What's your stroke?
Stop rowing so I can get in.
Wanna race?
Can I get a ride? I can't swim.
Man overboard! Captain! Man overboard!
Merrily? Dream? Really?
If you come across two guys following a prancing Majorette, tell 'em I took a wrong turn at the last mirage.
How come you always get to row and I have to swim?
"Dissolve the EPA," you said! "What's the worst that could happen?" you said!
Please help me, I can't swim.
Jesus, Marvin! Just admit you were wrong about global warming!
We should’ve stopped when we reached land.
I may be thirsty but I'm not crazy.
Which one of us is the mirage.
I don't care how much of a bargain it was, leave it!
No wonder the Aral Sea getaway package was so cheap
Stop splashing sand on me!
Okay, it's your turn to push...
Watch it man I'm swimming here
Help! I'm drowning.
You can lead a man to drink but you can't make him water
Are you Row? I'm Wade.
Would you PLEASE stop singing 'Row, Row, Row Your Boat'!
Do you know the way to San Jose?
I thought you said we were going for dessert.
You just couldn't pull over and ask for directions?
Row, row, row all you want. Just, for God's sake, stop singing.
Watch your wake
Is this the way to the Climate Accord?
I can't believe you passed me.
Don't you know any other songs?
Pass on the right!
For the last time, I'm not going to drown!
And I thought I was lost.
Can I get a lift to the next mirage?
Just add water.
You know I can't swim ... throw me the life preserver!
I feel like you DO need directions.
One more 'merrily' and you're capsized!
I'm HAVING a stroke!
Actually, why don't we both get up and walk?
I think the least you could do is share your mirage with me.
You didn't read the reviews before booking, did you?
I'll get back in if you promise to quit singing 'Row, Row, Row Your Boat.'
What part of "no wake" don't you understand?
your Uber profile promised air conditioning!
I told you we should have taken the Jeep.
Hey, slow down. This is a no wake zone
Would it kill you to let me row for a while?
Damn it, Noah! You said there would be a flood. Do you know how ridiculous we look?
You just ruined my castle.
It's been an hour, it's my turn!
The Nile? Turn left at the first pyramid.
I'm not leaving without my contact lense.
I've been yelling, "Man overboard" for an hour! Are you going to jump in and save me or what?!
Get the hell off my lawn.
My turn to row, your turn to swim.
Don't row so fast!
I think the tide is turning.
You smack sand in my face with that oar one more time, I'll sink your damn boat!
I'll start rowing again, as soon as I can find my contact lense.
Oh sure, ask me to paddle now that we are approaching a dune!
Hallelujah! Michael rowed the boat ashore!
It’s not funny anymore, Moses. Put the water back.
Can't you just skip the damn 'life is but a dream' part?
Put a life jacket on, you fool.
No, I haven't seen the great white camel.
I like your mirage better than mine!
Wha'd'ya' mean there's another one behind you?
No, I haven't seen the lake.
What d'ya mean, you're 'out of water'?!
Do you still think climate change isn't real?
IS life but a dream?
Mind if I draft?
Hey Michael, It's just a song!
I miss the good old days on our tiny island with the one palm tree.
For the last time I am still going to call it Global Warming!
One of us has got this wrong.
You fool! High tide won't be for another eight years!
Wait 'till the tide comes back in.
We shoulda listened to Al Gore.
Could you give me a ride to the next mirage?
Thank God! Is your name Michael?
Goddamn, Google maps.
I'm sorry, I can only pick up at an oasis.
Damn it Michael. Quit it already. It is just a song!
Hey, you. I've got the right-of-way.
I fail to see how this floats your boat.
No, it's a 5K crawlathon. Rowathon's next week.
Next vacation let's go up a creek without a paddle.
And I say it was abandoned for good reason!
So pissed I forgot my fitbit.
Climate change is real, Donald!
I'll get in when the flood starts and not a minute before.
You pledging a fraternity too?
You can't leave me here. I'll drown!
Man overboard? - Very funny.
How many times must we hear "recalculating" before you get that you should have turned left at the beach?
Your mirage might have water but mine doesn't
Have you seen Wilson?
If I wasn't such a masochist, you'd be a naked woman mirage.
Are you 100% sure about this google map thingy?
It's a nursery rhyme, Bill. Not a survival technique.
Yeah, my GPS gave me this alternate route too.
Aren't you worried without a life jacket?
When does the tide come in?
Really wish you'd stop singing that damn song.
That's weird, I didn't hear anything about a small craft advisory.
Hey, buddy...I'm drowning here!
Stop flicking sand in my face!
I didn't think this was what he meant when he said he'd drain the swamp.
One of us is losing it.
For the last time, put on your life jacket!
I can't swim
This was a lake when I started... Damn global warming.
Slow Down!
I know you're a mirage because there's cold beer in your boat.
Sorry, I'm just following my GPS too!
Race you back?
You rowed the boat ashore three days ago, Michael.
Hey! You know common courtesy calls for you saying "passing on your left"
Maybe we'll find a desert island.
I was joking. Let me back in the boat!
Get the hell out of my mirage!
Could you at least have said "on your left?"
For god's sake, man, can't you see we're in the wrong cartoon?
I still remember when slow wi-fi was my biggest problem.
I know you are a mirage because I can't swim.
How come I have to swim?
I think I'm dying of heat stroke, stroke, stroke!
Come back! You know I can't crawl!
Don't blame me, I voted for Her.
One of us is an illusion.
You got your wish. He parted the whole sea.
I've been treading sand this whole time, and you have a boat!?
Next mirage, I get to row!
I hope you remember where we parked the car.
GPS ain't what it used to be
"Would you PLEASE quit singing "Row, row , row your boat"?
At this point I officially declare that - THE TIDE IS OUT!
Sisyphus had it relatively easy
You could have wished for two seats.
Don't give me that Merrily Merrily Life is But a Dream crap.
Remember when life was but a dream?
What desert isle! You're in the wrong cartoon.
You're asking me for a glass of water?
Hey!! I'm crawlin' here! I'm crawlin' here!
You know I can't swim!
You're complaining? You're the one in the boat!
I can't find your contact anywhere!
Want a coxswain?
Please tell me it's not my turn to row.
Michael, STOP rowing your boat ashore!
This is ridiculous, I'm quitting CrossFit.
You're trespassing on my mirage.
I can't believe you threw me overboard. You know i can't walk.
Hey, you should be wearing your life jacket!
I think it´s my turn to row.
Shut-up and row! It was your idea to leave the country if he won!
No fair -- you rode the tsunami in.
How about a lift to the next sand dune.
What did you do to the albatross?
I should be doing the rowing,you know I can't swim!
I know a shortcut but you're going to have to help me carry the boat across a river.
If you won't let me get in the boat, you could at least throw me a life jacket.
Don't give up now! Every beach ends at water!
Ha! Ha! You fool, I punched a hole in the bottom of the boat, just in case you left without me. You won't get far.
You idiot, you forgot the life jackets.
At least you could throw me a life jacket.
Just wait for high tide and then we will make some real time.
Only a fool would take on the Sahara without a coxswain
O.K., I'll say it, you are the world's most dedicated lifeguard.
I see you got the leak fixed. Good job!
Please, no wake.
I ordered a black car.
It's your turn to crawl!
I knew we should have asked for directions at that oasis!
Stop singing 'This Sand Is Your Sand' and let me on your boat.
I get to row at the next mirage
I've been swimming for an hour. Its time to switch.
You optimists tick me off!
Dude you gotta relax, it is not a race!
We could solve both of our problems with a little water.
Can't you see I'm drowning here.
No I'll be fine thanks. You don't get many sharks this far south.
It would be easier if we agreed on compatible hallucinations!
Michael, I said, "DON'T row the boat ashore!"
It's my turn in the mirage
This is a "No Wake" zone, you jerk!
You don't seem to have a lot of room. I'm going to wait for the next one.
You think you know where you're going, but you're in De-Nile.
What took you so long?
You know, that's a two-stroke penalty for grounding your club in the sand.
Could you slow down? My skis slipped off.
I didn't know we were allowed to actually use our mirages.
And you call yourself a mirage?
When I was your age, we didn't have fancy boats. We CRAWLED to where we needed to be.
This is the last time I accept a "free" trip anywhere!
Yeah, I missed the boat. So what?
Stop with the gently down the stream ok?
I could help you row, and we'll get there faster.
High tide be damned, I think we can rest now.
Oil the damn oarlocks, they're driving me crazy!
You must be Michael.
I hope your boat sinks!
One of us is hallucinating and I'm hoping that it's you.
You're in the crawl lane, a**hole!
No! I have right of way.
Life is but a dream, eh!
Don't be ridiculous. Of course global warming is a hoax
I don't suppose you've got a spare life jacket.
Quit splashing me!
At least one of us is lost.
Alright, maybe global warming wasn't invented by the Chinese.
What happened to yesterday's mirage with the motor?!
Well, you don't have to do it so merrily!
Race you!!
Rescue at last! My name is Donner. The rest of my party are unable to join us.
Hey! Why don't you look where you're going?
Is that you Michael?
Stop! I just lost a contact lens.
Nuts! I was sure climate change was a hoax!
If you ask me to say stroke one more time I am going to have one.
I no longer care that this used to be an ocean!
That's the last time I hire a safari guide through Craigslist.
Do you mind?! Your wake is slowing me down!
Any Grey Poupon?
Great, now you're going all dinghy on me!
What a moron, how could you not notice I fell overboard three days ago?
Crawl was always my best stroke.
I can't say I share your optimism.
I'm telling you, without my contacts I can't see where we're headed!
Watch where you're going ! You just missed me.
Hey, my sandcastle!
Is it my turn to row yet?
Sorry, I'm currently only accepting women and children.
For the last time, it's not a beach and I don't need a lifeguard.
Mr. Fancy--up shit creek, with TWO paddles!
So you're not even going to help me look for my contact?
No thanks; it doesn't look safe.
Your technique is not the problem!
So you had to say, 'Come Hell or high water?'
Does it look like I have an extra sextant?
When you find yourself running aground, the first rule is: Stop rowing!
Let's row to the Bermuda Triangle he says... it'll be fun he says...
The least you could do is throw me a life preserver.
Can I catch a ride in your mirage?
Michael your boat was ashore 4 days ago!
You said 'sun and sand', Jeremy. You did NOT mention water.
This row versus wade debate is exhausting!
Just looking for my contact lens.
Would you stop rowing for just a minute and help me find my contact lens?!
So much for 'life is but a dream,' Harold.
Would you perchance be in need of a coxswain?
Face it, we're both deserted.
I hate to break it to you brother, but you're no better off than I am.
Thanks, I'll wait for the next dune buggy.
OK, I'll help bail if you let me back in.
Tell me when you want to take a break.
What do you mean you can't swim....
My turn to row.
Shouldn't you be wearing a life preserver?
That's the last time we sign up for a DIY cruise!
Look, I still can't find your contact lens! Let's just keep going.
I'll get in the boat after I find my contact lens.
How could you forget the life preserver?
Grey Poupon?
No, it's not the Australian crawl, it's just the crawl.
Come on, I'm drowning here!
Believe me yet? I told you not to vote for him!
Get out of my mirage.
I think you're in the wrong mirage.
It's my turn now.
'Life is but a dream.' Yeah, right.
Isn't it my turn yet?
Will you please stop rowing, I'm trying to find my contact.
Use your core, man! It's all about the core!
You seen my keys?
Please! No more "row, row, row your boat"!
Have you seen a white whale?
Remind me again, what are we training for?
You forgot the fishing poles?!
This gym is clearly overcharging.
Of course, that's a great chest and arms workout,but I'm getting total body fitness!
Have you seen a golf ball?
We reached the shore miles ago. I'm done proving it.
And still, you deny climate change?
Let's stop a while and see if we can catch some fish.
No offense, but you are the worst mirage ever.
I told you, I'd rather swim.
No, I didn't see a great white whale.
Is that the only song you know?!?
Throw me a life preserver! I can't swim.
Would you happen to have some Grey Poupon?
Oh yeah, now my ship has come in.
I sing merrily, merrily and THEN you come in!
Thank God for Uberboat!
For the last time, stop splashing me!
It could be worse, it could be raining.
Your oar is in my lane, Buddy!
No that's OK, I'll swim to shore.
Aw, come on, I can't swim.
Yes, I know how to swim, but what's your point?
Call me Ishmael. What's your's?
It was cute the first time you rowed the boat ashore, Michael, but now you're just showing off!
What is wrong with you? A guy in a mirage should be driving a jeep!
Hey!! I'm crawlin' here! I'm crawlin' here!
I bet you didn't update your new GPS either.
Stay in your lane!
I told Uber to send a camel, not a metaphor!
Just wait 'til the tide turns.
Well, hallelujah, Michael!
Will you quit with the "Merrily, Merrily, Merrily"!
Still think global warming fears are exaggerated?
Did I ever tell you just how much I detest your optimism?!
You're rowing against the grains.
So, what kinda mileage are you getting?
OK, Michael, we've been ashore for hours. Now what?
I don't know, why do you think the boat feels lighter?
Old Testament story cut by editor: Noah joins forces with Moses.
Really? You think you need four "merrily"s?
Did the Groupon explicitly mention water was included?
I hope you spring a leak.
I've been assured that life is but a dream.
Because I'd rather burn my hands and feet than explaining you one more time what 'irony' is.
You think you have it hard? At least you've got a boat!
Yes, we're both tired, thirsty and hungry - but other than that, we're not really in the same boat.
I think we need a little less ebb and a lot more flow.
Are you my Uber ride?
So, how is this dream about sex?
No, I don't know the way to San Jose.
Ahoy Captain! Permission to call you an idiot!
Hal-a-frickin'-looyah! Stop rowing, Michael!"
So global warming is a hoax!
Watch it, buddy. This is a no-wake zone.
What I said was by land OR by sea.
one of us is a mirage
WHO said it was a three hour tour?
So much for your prediction of rising ocean levels making this ideal beachfront property.
Worst mirage ever.
Can I get a lift to the mirage?
Hey, your first meeting of Climate Deniers Anonymous too?
Excuse me sir. I don't suppose you could spare a little water!
Get your own mirage
...the bad news is, I think one of us still has to eat the other
Why do you always get to row?
Global warming has a weird way of sneaking up on you.
Well, at least I'm one stage closer to 'acceptance' than you are!
Buy the rowboat, you said. It's nicer than the camel.
Michael, do you really think you can row your boat ashore?
When did you say the sea level would rise?
All we need is that rising tide.
Let's just call for an Uber.
Dammit, feather your oars.
It would be a lot faster if you put up a sail.
Don't just stare; throw me a life preserver.
Hey! This is a no wake zone.
You came all this way and you didn't bring any water?
I don't care if you can't swim-my turn
If I had known this is what they meant by 'Uber Ultra Basic' I would have spent the extra 5 bucks!
How can I be sure it won't capsize?
I always knew you didn't have all your oars in the water!
Okay now try putting it in reverse.
Do you have any lip balm?
Enough is enough - download the Google Maps update!
Sorry, last marina I saw was at the mirage about 30 miles back.
Help me find my car keys and we'll drive out.
So you still think global warming's a hoax?
I don't care if getting there is half the fun, you look like an idiot!
Slow Down! This is a low wake zone.
Lucky you. My boat sprung a leak.
Can I borrow your phone charger?
For the hundredth time, it's not "gently down the seam."
Okay, Michael. Go on and row the boat ashore you asshole.
So which one of us is seeing the mirage?
Michael, they were saying to row ashore, not onshore.
And life is NOT a dream
Hey Mike, please stop rowing the boat ashore.
Never seen the tide so low.
You one percenters make me sick!
Can I borrow your sunscreen?
Are you still a climate change skeptic?
Another mile and I'm switching to the butterfly.
Oh no, they mixed the metaphors!
You're just leaving me here to drown in your mirage?
I admire your enthusiasm.
Enough training. I'm ready for the English Channel now.
You'd better hurry up. The beach closes at sundown.
Life had better be but a dream.
Would you please stop singing that damn song?!!?
C'mon, let me in. I'm dying out here.
Are we far enough away from Trump yet?
Fine then. I'll swim
You need a coxswain?
What's this rising tide you keep yammering about?
Beat it, pal! This is my mirage!
Mom says to pick up some milk on your way back.
Yes, but it is a really wet sand.
For the love of Science, get out of the boat and admit global warming is real!
But what do you do for your quads?
My turn to row now ... you swim!
So life is but a dream, huh?
You know if you let me back in we could make better time .
But he said global warming wasn't real!
I'm Sorry! Please, just let me get back in the boat!
The least you could do is throw me a life preserver.
How about I row and you push?
I think we're stuck on a sandbar!
No, thanks. I'll walk.
Maybe with two of us rowing we could make it.
at least you're up the creek with a paddle
This is not what I expected when I wished for dry land.
I texted for an Uber!
Now they're saying no rain until Thursday.
Move over sand rover.
Michael, how long are you going to row your boat ashore?
Next time I'm booking the cruise.
Can we switch yet?
Going my way?
Are you ready to admit now that there's a reason the river less travelled by is less travelled by?
Sorry, but I liked the majorette in my last desert ordeal.
Do you mind? I can't swim with your oar in the way!
You're going the wrong way!
Please! Please! There are sand sharks everywhere!!!....
I say we switch at the next rest stop.
Apparently we've reached the Dry Tortugas.
We both could use a little water.
Say "sculling" one more time and I'll break your oars.
Hey man, you're in the wrong cartoon.
Hell and back, or one way?
Why do you always get to ride in the boat?
I should have updated the GPS.
Quick, toss me a life jacket!
Michael - enough already. Stop rowing!
Do you happen to have a life vest?
Well it wasn't my idea to come to California!
What do you mean your trying to find the dry dock?
"I'll race ya".
Heat stroke, heat stroke, heat stroke...
Gently down the STREAM, Ian, gently down the STREAM!
So, do you still deny climate change?
I'm doing the crawl. What are you doing?
If you can row on sand, I can crawl on water!
In retrospect I don't think I was the problem.
Where does gently down the stream come in?
You must be one of those global warming skeptics.
Okay, no more megaphone.
What part of global are you not getting?
It's dessert, not desert. Be careful what you wish for!
Stroke of genius my ass!
The hardest day of my life was the day I sold my boat.
Guess what! That boat's a mirage too!
Have you seen my surfboard?
Let's switch. I play Rose and you play Jack.
Wait, is El Niño or La Niña the wet one?
That's your wish?!
My God, just how large is this beach!
I prayed for water, not Walter!
It's safe to get out of the boat now.
Can I get a ride? I can't swim any longer.
Joe, lets go back to gym membership. Its only 20 bucks a month.
Sing "row, row, row your boat" one more time and I swear, your life WILL be but a dream!!
Come on, lemme back in. I promise not to criticize your rowing technique again.
Hey! Pass on the starboard!
"Slow down would you? Can't you see I'm trying to find my contact lens?
What do you mean, 'The other choice was a camel'?
Yes, this is the other Dead Sea.
Michael! Stop rowing the boat ashore!
For the last time, stop saying there's no more room in the boat!
Watch it! I'm crawling here!
Where's your life vest?
wait! You need a coxswain!
Life is but a dream, right.
Have you seen my glasses?
I said merrily, dammit!
I can take the heat - I can even take being lost - but I just can't take that song anymore!
And you forgot the life-jackets?!
I thought you said we were going for dessert.
I told you climate change is real!
Why do you always get to row downhill?
You're not leaving without me!
The OTHER way, you idiot!
Isn't it about time you global warming deniers gave up?
If you must know, I was a coxswain for 4 years at Harvard.
Wish they'd call off this climate change hoax!
Watch out, sand sharks up ahead!
I've heard of "Rowe v. Wade", but never "Row v. Crawl."
Feel sorry for the next bastard who tells me he doesn't believe in climate change.
You gonna toss me a line or what?
Caught anything?
No, no! You come in BEFORE "gently down the stream!"
I dunno, but it sure beats rowing upstream without a paddle.
The fraternity can kiss my ass!
Why don't I row and you do the swimming?
~No Wake, dammit, No Wake!~
Yeah, life is but a dream alright.
Ok, then you be the visionary and I'll be the team player.
'Let's rent a house at the beach,' she said.
Sorry, the last Starbuck's I saw was at least 3 mirages south.
Pound sand.
Hey buddy, man overboard!
Finally
Are you seriously going to drop me off here?
You need a plus-one for the diamond lane, pal!
I asked you to wait!
Why is it you kids always have to look for the easy way out of doing everything?
Where's your life jacket??!
This is pedestrians only.
Do you have any idea of how annoying you are?
Okay Mike, you rode the boat ashore. What's the next verse say?
This IS land, you idiot!
Really, beachfront property?
You realize you're taking climate change denial to a whole new level?
Your irony is interfering with my stereotype
Can't you help a drowning man?
Hey, I'm crawlin' here!
You need a coxswain?
Heat stroke, heat stroke, heat stroke...
Sand, sand everywhere and not a grain to eat
Row harder. We're the last 2 climate skeptics.
We got it, Michael. Now please stop rowing our boat ashore.
You can stop now; you've scraped off all the barnacles.
Coach, OK to switch to the backstroke< the crawl is killing me?
I believe, Michael, that you've clearly rowed your boat ashore.
Michael, you've rowed far enough!
Only now do I appreciate the fact that you named your boat after your wife, Sandy.
There's sand in my suit.
That's what you get for asking to be transferred to dry land
Still sure this was a shortcut?
Let's hope we're all part of a mirage
Quick sand my ass.
Careful, it's pretty shallow ahead of you.
Hi this is Ezekiel did you order an Uber?
Are you SURE this is going to be an Olympic sport?
Get it right this time, Herb. When I get to 'gently' you come in with ' row, row, row'.
I think you can safely let me in the boat now.
Still don't believe in global warming?
And you said Al Gore was full of it!
Excuse me, this is a no wake zone!
What say we drop man-overboard training 'til we get to the coast ?
I promise I believe in climate change now.
O.k, o.k. Global warning exists. Now throw me a life preserver.
Did you happen to find a set of keys?
Why don't you cry me a river?
No, dammit! You sing "row, row, row your boat" when I sing "gently down the stream!"
Stop yer splashin'!
I told you "Camels are the ships of the desert", but would you listen???
Impressive rowing, but the camel is still the ship of the desert.
When I was your age I'd crawl to school twenty miles each day in a sand storm uphill.
Don't feel bad. I could have sworn it was water, too!
Well now that you've lost the Professor and Marry Ann, it's down to us!
For the last time. It's a mirage
Really, you're going to quote Donne to me?
Let’s call it a draw and just walk.
You're in denial.
Another hour then it's my turn in the boat.
You were right - your way is faster.
This mirage ain't big enough for the two of us.
No, thanks, it's a nice day, I will swim.
No, No, No!! You start row, row, row your boat, when I finish gently down the stream!
... Life is but a dream.
Hey. No wake!
Trust me, if I can crawl on it... you can walk on it.
Save me! The place is teeming with sand sharks!
I'm crawlin' here! I'm crawlin' here!
I'd keep rowing. You're starting to look like a fried chicken sandwich.
I assure you, it won't capsize if you stop and pull me in.
You told me we were going for dessert...
It's a marathon, not a sprint!
Where's your life jacket??!
You're a little dingy.
Cross-training's a bitch, eh?
I thought tides were supposed to rise with global warming!
You said it would be my turn soon...!
Stop! Can't you see I'm drowning here?
I feel like we left the stove on.
Drop anchor! I've lost my contact lens!
Enough with the "Row, row, row your boat" already!
Different strokes for different folks.
That "Land ahoy!" talk is getting to me, OK?
I saw it too, but at some point you have to admit it was just a mirage.
May the ocean rise to meet you.
So, do you still think that global warming is a hoax?
For the last time, I don't need a life preserver!
Global warming took all of the fun out of Lake Winnipesaukee.
No thanks; I'm waiting for an UberSelect.
What are you doing here in my mirage?
There still isn't a drop to drink.
I would give you a push but I am in the middle of Sun Salutation.
I should try walking on the water? Now you tell me!
Can I get a lift?
For the last time, it's my turn in the boat!!
I'm too much ballast? That's what you're most worried about?
Well, are you going to just sit there and let me drown or pull me in?
Who do you think you're calling a mirage?
You're in the,wrong cartoon.
I'm really sorry to hear about the blisters on your hands.
Can't you just toss me a life preserver?
Admit it. We're lost!
At least you've got a paddle.
How bout a ride to shore?
No, I do NOT want to discuss Roe v Wade again!
Keep rowing, Wikileaks said there was a beach here, the government is just hiding it from us.
Caught anything?
Way to cut me off, buddy!
Row if you want to. I'm going to swim.
No, I nave NOT seen your camel!
Hey, Speed Racer! This is a no-wake zone!
Front crawl, butterfly, breaststroke--sure. But I'm telling you, heatstroke is NOT a competitive event, Coach!
Hey--that's not what "one if by land" means!
It's my turn to row now.
You're not Uber!
"You should never, ever have questioned our guide's credentials".
Whaddya mean, surge pricing?
Michael, this is too far ashore.
Do I look like I know which way to water?
Remind me about how "climate warming" is bullshit and will have no effect whatsoever on our lives or leisure activities.
We're gonna need a bigger ocean.
Let me know when you want to switch places.
'Row, row, row your boat' got old when we hit land, Leonard.
Let's see your mirage license.
No! It is not my turn to row!
Perception is reality? Give me a break, man.
You're STILL denying climate science?!!!
I'm guessing you're one of those 'glass half-full' kind of guys.
Only 4 more years...
You just couldn't take directions from that camel could you!
My turn!
Your wake is disturbing my swim!
Why don't you get out and push?
Quit saying "Life is a beach", dammit!
I would ask to get on board , but you don't have any life jackets .
Still in denial?
No... I'm not a @*<%ing mermaid!
And I thought I was the crazy one
Yeah, that's right...I'm sick and tired of you always hogging the boat!
ONE OF US is seeing things!
You know something, it is a perfect way to get the barnacles off.
Enough already just admit that Global Warming is real!!
I thought you said it would rain, Noah!
Slow down! I'm doing the crawl stroke.
I'm starting to re-think this whole "Global Warming is a scam" thing
You realize you've entered the swimming zone, don't you?
You didn't happen to find one of my contacts back there, did you?
Is this your idea of a watershed moment?
That's what's wrong with rowing backwards.
Pipe down with that "Merrily, Merrily" yammer, would you!
It's alright for you in that rowboat - out here, life is anything but a dream.
If you think that's bad, try swimming.
Tomorrow, I get to row.
What do you mean what am I doing!
Have you seen my contact lens by any chance?
Hey, I'm crawlin' here!
Hey, slow down. This is a no wake zone
Are you sure that's a one-man dinghy?
Row v. whatever
You keep forgetting that it is a dry heat.
Boat without water; you can't even do a mirage right!
Now will you turn on the GPS?
Don't just sit there, I lost my contact lens!
Yes, I've heard of sand sharks.
Nice mirage, now can you conjure up some water to go with it?!
This miracle lacks the wow factor, stick with walking on water.
Isn't climate change a bitch?
What climate change? This is just cyclical!
Why do you always get to steer?
Hey, I'm walking here!
We are in the same boat!
Do you take credit cards?
Waze says it's clear sailing till we hit the 405.
You can stop singing that song now!
Stop hogging the rowing machine, it's my turn.
Global warming? Nonsense! it's the media that's the problem!
I said merrily, merrily, merrily
It's a reverse mirage. Keep paddling.
You look like you need a coxswain.
No wake please!
You said it's my turn three dunes ago.
I know its my turn to row, but I get sea sick.
exactly how did the ship sink?
Do you honestly still think we might need the damn boat?
Idiot!
Whether it floats your boat is really not the point.
"For the last time Michael, row the boat ashore!
Michael, you rowed your boat ashore, hallelujah!
I think you are in total denial of our situation.
Are you running a local or express?
Thank God I found you.
How many more miles until you admit it's a sea change?
Row v. "Wait"
This is not, 'just like crossfit.'
Stroke! Stroke! Stroke!
I'm gonna win this race if it's the last thing I do.
OK let's agree, you have your mirage and I have mine.
When is your turn to tread water?
This is not what I envisioned when you said, you wanted to be the 1st to row around the world.
Enough with the "life's is but a dream"!!
I am not, singing another line of Row, Row, Row, your boat.
Wow, buddy, you're even more lost than I am.
Look where you're going!
Hallelujah! Is your name Michael?
Did you bring a tide chart?
NOW, can we call an Uber?
A little sidestroke now and then for variety, but mostly crawl — why?
See, I told you not to drink this water. It makes you crazy.
I just realized, you can be of no help to me.
How's the fishing ?
This just doesn't feel right.......I think that the coxswain is supposed to stay in the boat.
Hey, watch it pal, can't you see I'm crawlin' here!
At least you have two paddles.
What part of "No Wake Zone" don't you understand?
Did you happen to see a marching band come this way?
Finding your contact seems like the least of our worries.
You up for pulling a skier?
You are ashore already Michael.
It's my turn to row, damn it!
If you yell stroke one more time I'm going to have one.
Yeah, dries out quick this time of year.
I'd help you row, but I lost my contacts.
I get it, Chad, you rowed in college.
Damn you! You told me you were going to "Make the Desert Great Again!"
Row on. Find your own cartoon!
For crying out loud! Today's legs, not upper body - get with the program!
You're a lawyer too? Jeez, drain the swamp and bottom-feeders are the last to know!
This is a no wake zone!
Boy,did you take a long time getting here.
Couldn't you at least hallucinate something motorized?
Hey...I had the right of way!
One more 'merrily' and your life will be a nightmare!
Hey, slow down!!
Do you have room for one more?
It's "gently down the stream," you idiot.
You're in the,wrong cartoon.
It's Michael row your boat ashore , not onshore.
You mirages really go all-out nowadays.
There is a ton of salt in this water.
What do you mean, "Grab an oar?"
It's about time you showed up. I was going under for the third time.
How many times will you remind me that we're not in the same boat, Captain Obvious?!!
No, we swim this leg.
Is your name Michael?
And you said global warming was going to cause floods. Loser!
A great white whale? Sure, one swam by a couple hours ago.
What did you do with your life jacket?!?
Any update on climate change?
I think the artist forgot the water.
Ok. Not a caption but suggestions for 2 cartoons, I cannot draw. First- Trump at desk piled high with money. "The buck stops here" sign on desk. Second- tourists in front of WH saying "it says it's available on air B&B".
Thanks for reducing your wake.
Uber for Moses?
Haven't you heard of rideshare?
This is MY hallucination!
Fill my mouth with sand one more time and we're swapping places.
I don't care what you think, Global Warming is still a hoax!
Still believe global warming isn't real?
I know a life preserver wouldn't do me any good, but you could have at least offered.
I wish I was up a creek!
Race you!!
'Sand Ho!
Pass on the right, @$$#*!!
How about a lift buddy?
No, you fool! I said, 'Get a water carafe,' not 'a watercraft.'
Tomorrow, I row and you be on pearl duty!
Hey!...How about "On your left!"?
The next time you sign up for a river cruise, check the long range forecast.
Yeah, rowing is good but I find that I get better results with yoga.
"I said, 'Let's find Moby, not the Gobi.'
Take the shortcut, you said!
If you sing "life is but a dream" one more time...
Could you please stop rowing sand in my face!
Permission to come aboard Cap'n, I'm sick of swimming.
Fine! Alex Trebeck really does know every answer. Now can I get back in?
It's my turn to row and your turn to ski.
Here, I am trying to find my contact and you just go rowing right over it!
For Pete's sake, if you sing "merrily, merrily, merrily" one more time ...
Damn it man, I'm trying to take a drink here.
So much for 'life is but a dream!'
Why don't you watch where you're going?
I told you I could find the drain!!
He also drained Lake Erie.
Now do you realize why throwing me overboard was a futile punishment?
What happens on the boat, stays on the boat
What part of "no wake" don't you understand?
Keep rowing I can see land!
Captain? I thought you were supposed to go down with the ship.
Something tells me you're not real.
I'm tired of being the friendly dolphin -- let's switch!
Dammit Ed, is it my turn to use the boat!
Michael, stop rowing. You're ashore. Hallelujah!
Don't just sit there! Toss me a life jacket!
Hey, you're in my lane.
Who says you can't get up shit creek without a paddle?
Aren't you a sight for sore thighs!
Row row row your boat, roughly through the sand, terribly terribly terribly terribly, you are on dry land.
I'm sorry. I was hoping for a ride that goes further than that.
There is no high tide!
Thanks for the offer, but I get terribly sandsick.
There's a twenty-minute rule on the rowing machine.
Michael, why are you rowing the boat ashore?
Well this fits right in with the melting clocks.
Okay, you win.
Are you gonna toss me a life jacket or not?!!
We need wine, women, and directions.
Michael, how many times do I have to tell you? It's just a song.
How soon did you say the deluge was coming?
Enough. already, with the "Michael Row Your Boat Ashore."
I don't think you've grasped our dilemma.
You knocked me off my paddleboard, man!
So, what did you really wish for?
You're the dumbest mirage I've ever seen!
It was my turn to row two mirages ago.
I specifically ordered an UberSUV!
So much for "Off-season rates - Sandy beach!"
Michael, row the boat to a shore.
Slow down. This stuff is not easy to swim in.
For the last time, you come in after I sing "Gently down the stream"!!
You think you could talk to the Red Sea again?
Hey, get your own mirage!
It's the other way to the ocean.
Don't you just hate mixed metaphors?
What did I tell you about wearing your lifejacket?
What do you mean I'm swimming in it?
Oh, it's you, Mr. "women and children first!"
Ahoy There my ass.
So you thought the sea would rise with global warming, eh?
You hit my sandcastle and didn't stop.
Each man to his own delusions!
Can I get a lift to the next mirage?
If you MUST sing that song, can you skip the 'Life is but a dream' line?
Why can't I row and you push?
First mate reporting for duty.
No thanks, I'm terrified of drowning.
"Hit me with that oar one more time and we're going to have a problem".
See, I told you I'd still get seasick.
It's a damn good thing we can't swim.
Let me onboard! I'm drowning here!
'I'll pass on the ride, but thanks for the offer.
No. The sand isn't starting to feel wetter.
Would you mind rowing in a straighter line. I'm trying to draft off your wake.
The imagination is admirable - it's the pretension I can't stand
I asked God to send help but this is the wrong joke.
Permission to board, captain?
No oars in the bike lane, dude!
Do you want to rent the boat for another hour?
Dammit Joe, I said I'm sorry!
I told you high tide's not for another few hours
So, my part comes in at "Gently Down the Stream?"
That 'merrily' word. I don't think it means what you think it means.
Watch where you're going!
I don't think the tide's coming in.
Next time I pick the route.
Apple Maps?
OK, you win. .. your mirage is better than mine.
For God's sake man, don't leave me here to die!
What do you mean "a rising tide lifts all boats"?
I'd call you crazy if we weren't making the same amount of progress.
What part of "gently down the stream" don't you understand?
You're right - I can touch
Are we there yet?
Didn't the race end when we hit the beach?
Right, no leak! Now can I get back in the boat?
'Life is but a dream' . . . my ass!
Are you an allusion or a delusion?
This is my last die-athalon.
Are you a mirage? Or am I?
I'm already through anger and at acceptance. Will you please get past the denial phase?
'Easy for you to say. You've got a boat and oars!"
No, I'm not thankful that at least it's a dry heat.
You took forever. I am cancelling my Amazon prime membership!
We have already passed the oasis.
You're getting us nowhere! Let me row for awhile.
No, it's not any cooler here in the water.
Don't worry, I've been assured Global Warming is a hoax. Keep rowing.
Is it just me or do we not have both oars in the water?
The boat's bad enough, but do you have to sing sea shanties too?
I told you, we can switch at the next mirage.
Do you ever get the feeling that this is all but a dream?
Faster! We're missing Burning Man!
I was right in more than just one way to say you don't have both your oars in the water.
"Hey, can I get in the boat?" "No way, it's only built for one." Ella is 7, we know that is too young, but she REALLY wanted me to send her caption in. Thank you.
Michael? We reached the shore quite a few miles back.
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, not!
Is that an off road vehicle?
Of course there's room!
Don't just sit there, throw me a life preserver.
Can't you see I've lost my contact lens?!
Lost?! Of course you're lost, you idiot!
Apparently, you misunderstood Hemingway's book....
Fred, you don't have to yell 'stroke'
Hey, how often do you get to pose for a Dali painting?
How come YOU get to sit in the boat?
If you build it, it still won't rain.
Now, you think we should have asked for directions!!
$25 for a lift?! Thanks, I'll crawl.
'One of the two of us is seeing things.'
I told you we were beached way back there.
Yes, Michael, that's far enough.
I lost my contact lens.
What do you mean 'Sorry, this is the express'?
I had requested a camel from Uber
Your form is all wrong.
Your mother told you never to pick up strangers?
I'll race you to the mirage!
Quit splashing me!
Watch your wake
If you let me in, I'll tell you where the good fishing is.
Without my help, you'll never make it before the tide goes out!
One more verse of "Row, Row, Row your boat" and I will drown you!
Thanks for the offer but I think that I'll wait for something with wheels."
For the last time, you are going the wrong way!
I refuse to be a pawn in your mirage.
You're gonna need a bigger boat.
No wake!
OK, but I get to sing the "Merrily, Merrily" part this time
I’m not getting back in until I find my lucky penny.
That's carrying a mirage a little to far, Elliott!
Help! I'm drowning.
Did we forget anything?
How much further do you expect me to swim?
Have some compassion, man! Let me on board.
Merge already!
Noah's Ark 2.0 - Global Warming Edition
Do I look like I'm overboard ?
Try crawling a mile in my shoes.
Your navigational skills suck!
All I can say is, if you hit a squall, don't come asking for help!
You're in the wrong story!
And here I was, up the creek without a paddle!
No, it does NOT 'feel good to be on terra firma.'
You said I could row after that last wave.
I would, but I don't want to get sand in the boat.
Your optimism is annoying me, Bill.
For improved results you should probably try using something called water
No, Noah. The flood was last time.
You misinterpreted what I meant by 'don't reinvent the wheel'.
No Wake Zone, jerk!
Damn it, Oscar, you know I can't swim!
I don't care any more if you get sand in your shoes.
Can I hitch a ride to the mirage?
No Michael! I meant 'row the boat TO the shore'.
That's the NEXT stage of the triathlon.
This is the worst gym I've ever been to!
It's red right returning, you idiot!
You keep rowing, merrily, merrily, merrily, and I keep telling you, it's but a dream!
Just slow down and let me in!
Time to switch. You swim, I'll row."
Ironic, seems you're down a river with paddles.
It's not quite the miracle you seem to think it is.
I'm thinking there must be a small island with a single palm tree nearby.
Either I'm Jesus or you're an idiot.
You rowed into the wrong cliche.
On the bright side, my personal trainer said that this is a much better workout.
I could do with a dry scotch.
Michael. You've rowed your boat ashore and then some.
Enough already, Michael.
Make this river great again!
I wish you wouldn't yell "Ahoy" to every cactus.
Your wake is making this harder for me!
Now do you believe in climate change?
So this is what global warming has come to.
For Christ's sake, will you slow down?
I'm calling Uber next time.
Why am I always the last to know?
Life is not but a dream, ok?!
Hey! Watch where you're going!
I heard there is a speed trap up ahead
How much longer till we switch places?
This is not an either oar choice.
You call that a stroke?
Thanks, but I'm only crawling as far as the next dune.
You do know that a tsunami is coming!
What part of "gently down the stream" do you not get?
Don't tell me you forgot the frigging life vests?
How did you get over the wall?
Waiting for high tide?
Slow down! You trying to drown me in your wake?
I'm sure you're a mirage But you're an absolutely useless one
Would you mind getting out of my mirage?
Your optimism is killing me!
I thought the seas were rising.
Did you happen across a Fitbit?
'I'm warning you, one more verse of, ''Row, row, row your boat,'' and things could get ugly.'
Give up the "merrily" already -- there's no stream!
I'm starting to think that "ship of the desert" may have been a metaphor for something.
You are welcome to climb aboard as long as you don't bring up climate change.
I guess we're on an equal footing: You forgot the map, I lost my glasses.
If you let me in I'll help you raise the sail.
'Row, row, row your boat' - is that the only song you know?
Michael stopped when he got the boat ashore, Gerald.
Don't jinx it, at least it's a dry heat.
Hey, watch those oars! I'm swimming over here!
The fishing here is terrible.
Can't you stop long enough to save a drowning man?
Dude, I don't CARE that you rowed stroke at Princeton.
So YOU'RE the oars with no name!
Don't desert me, son.
Excuse me, do you have any water?
Get out of the way. I'm in a hurry!
Michael, you idiot, must you keep rowing your boat ashore?!
You're doing it wrong.
I don't know where you're going, but is there room for two?
You're doing it wrong.
If that sand goes in my face you'd better hope you're a mirage!
The boss says you need to turn on your vacation alert.
I see you still think global warming is a hoax.
"Can I bum a ride?'
How can you see where you're going?
For God's sake, throw me a life preserver."
Hey, buster! Stay in your lane!
The next time the robocaller gets you to stay on the line to win the free cruise, go ahead and buy the upgrade package OK?
Can we go back to being adrift?
It's all a hoax. Just keep rowing.
I'll board as soon as my luggage arrives.
That's a tough row to row.
I think you can stop rowing now, Michael.
The real problem with Trickle Down Economics is that some of us don't have a boat, you see...
Deserter!
You swim. My turn to row.
I capsized a few miles back! I appreciate the offer but I'm not going through that again.
Enough already, Michael, row your boat back to the water.
For the last time, keep your back straight and drive with your legs!
It's my turn to row!
Did NASA mention how we are supposed to get home?
Still in Da Nile?
Your call means a great deal to us ....
If you say, "Well this is no pleasure cruise" one more time, so help me...
So, you still think climate change is nonsense?
I would have appreciated a shout out saying you were going to pass.
If you feather your oars, you'll go a bit faster, mate.
Your sense of irony is killing me!
How about getting out and letting me row for a while.
Hey, shouldn't you be wearing a life jacket?
Which confused you more, "down the stream," or "gently?"
Come on in, the water's fine.
If you get to the mirage before me, save me a drink.
I'm tired of walking. Let me row for a while.
Slow it down, buddy! This is a no-wake zone!
For the last time--your strokes really need to be more fluid!
I forgot my life jacket.
Can't a brother bum a ride to the next mirage?
I don't care is your name is Ishmael, you are lost.
Worst Vegas trip ever.
Hey, man. Where's the fire?
I thought it was 'gently down a stream?'
Cairo; yeah, I get it. Still not funny.
Showoff!
Turn left at the next instersection.
Race you to the oasis!
Hey pal, your messing with my mirage.
Worst mirage ever.
Remind me again why you turned down the car?
Michael, you didn't have to take me literally.
I'd seen a flash flood, but I've never even heard of a flash drought.
You're being way too optimistic about this oasis.
Stop! Can't you see I'm drowning here?
I walk only on water.
One of us is experiencing a mirage.
Watch where you're going!
How's that mirage working out for you?
Well, at this point, I'd have to say the high water is not the obstacle.
Find your own water, buddy.
This ain't no merrily merrily dream, and that ain't no stream.
Wanna race to the mirage?
You were always the dreamer. I am much more down to earth.
"Can I bum a ride?'
Come on in, the water is great!
Do you mind?
Now you're just being a jerk!
You idiot! You're supposed to part the sea when you don't have a boat.
Where can I rent one of those?
Front crawl and rowing are more challenging since the drought!
you're rowing too fast!
You're supposed to be following, not racing ahead and splashing me all the time!
Michael, is that you?
Ever since we reached land, I've wondered why you don't get out of the boat.
Damn climate denier!
You forgot the women and children
All I'm saying is, absent the smell, the other creek wasn't so bad.
Hallelujah, Michael!
Get out! It's my turn to row!
Hey! I just finished smoothing out this desert!
For crying out loud, can't you ever stop being such an optimist?
It's "...gently down the STREAM..."!
So, you're still certain that climate change is nonsense?
Get out of the boat. It's your turn to crawl.
Long time, no sea. I thought the boat was rigged!
Hey, it's my turn to row and you to swim.
We've gone this far and now you're going to let me drown?
We'll never be rescued in this drought!
Why aren't you wearing life jacket?!!
Hey, I think I found dry land.
It took 4 years, but I told you he would "drain the swamp."
Would you at least stop singing that blasted song?!
That was a vulture which led you here, not an albatross.
I'll NEVER find my contact now!
If you think you've got it bad, you should have seen the creek I was up last week. Without a paddle.
Hey! Stay out of my genre!
Did you have to be so literal, Michael?
OK, I promise to not say 'Land ahead Captian' again, just let me back in.
I guess insufferable low-flush toilets weren't the answer after all.
Sir, there you are. You forgot to sign your boat rental waiver
Let's switch places at the next oasis
I requested an Uber "Premium". What is the meaning of this?
It's my turn to row the boat.
I was scuba diving but the visibility is poor.
Guess you did need a coxswain, huh?
You obviously don’t fully understand the concept of irony.
Let's change places. I row and you swim.
We escape from one cartoon cliche, only end up in another!
Lazy.
At least throw me a lifeline.
Maybe you're overthinking this.
What did you do, take the scenic route?
Would you consider rowing for Uber?
No life jacket? No thanks.
Can I hitch a ride to shore?
Imagine how hard it would be if you weren't in a mirage!
I'll give you this, George, you're an optimist.
So, how much dryland coaching have you done?
Well then, can I have a ride to the dry dock?
It's a race to the death
I miss saying, "moist."
When will it be my turn to row the boat, Greg?
I told you we should have made a left at that last mirage!
Four 'merrilys,' dammit!
I tried to tell you.
Hey Magellan, watch where you're rowing!
This is the only Uber in all of Coachella?
I know what the song says Michael, but enough is enough.
Thanks a lot. Your mirage just hit me in the head with an oar.
I'm usually not one to desert a sinking ship.
Can you throw me a life preserver?
Who do you think you're calling a mirage?
For the last time, I am not racing you to any cactus.
Hey, Jake, I'm beginning to think this lake is a mirage.
I hope there is a rest room at the oasis.
I ordered pastrami and got tsunami.
They haven't updated the directions since Moses came through here!
No, I don't want you to teach me how to fish!
No, I DON'T need a fitness coach!
How about a ride to the next port?
Row faster! I think I see land!
May I borrow that?
Let me guess, your name is Michael, and you take the lyrics to folk songs entirely literally.
You must be imagining things.
Well, I don't think you're making any better time than I am in that thing.
for the 100th time, it is just a mirage- Now let's cut our losses and leave the boat behind!
If you're not from Guinness World Records, get the hell off my casserole!
Michael, DON'T row the boat ashore.
I said we are in the same boat! I did not mean get one!
'I think I'll skip my turn."
Still no sign of water?
Is the Styx always so low this time of year Charon?
Luckily I don't believe in climate change.
Do you have any water?
You went in a circle again?!
Watch out! You're making waves!
Stroke!
Hey, can't you see I'm crawling, here?
...Merrilly, merrily, merrily, merrilly - just doesn't cut it for me anymore.
Is that the surge price or standard fare?
If I promise to help bail, will you let me in?
Why didn't we just stay on the Arc?
A triathlon usually involves water.
Look, I'm not going to pretend to swim so we can both "feel better" about this!
Per chance are you going my way?
My boat capsized. Can I hitch a ride with you?
So that darned Moses has been through here?
Hey, not fair, where can I get one of those?
This was easier before global warming.
Keep going - you're making good time. But stop splashing sand in my face!
Oh sure. Make me do all the crawling.
Aw, come on, I can't swim.
Seventy percent of the earth's surface is covered with water. What, exactly, did you type into the Sat Nav this time?
I never realized I was such a good swimmer.
Next time, just bring the camel.
You've overachieved again, Michael.
Do you see land?
Row, Row, Row your Boat is no longer on my Playlist.
Whadaya mean, you don't have a life preserver?
For Pete's sake, would you slow down and let me in!
I guess pleading for water at this point might seem superfluous.
You're the third person that's told me I was *their* mirage.
I thought I was the greatest fool in the world, but then of course, I saw an oar out of the corner of my eye.
We are on land. Just call it right or left.
Oh good, I was hoping this was surreal experience.
Which one of us is the mirage.
I lost my fins.
Is that you George or am I hallucinating?
I still say there is no such thing as global warming!
I told you, you couldn’t escape climate change.
If you sing "Row your boat" one more time I will gently put that oar ...
Canada or Mexico?
You said we were going to be heroes Noah
The sea level will be rising any minute now!
Trust me Columbus, you found land 5 hours ago.
When's it gonna be my turn to row?
I said camel, not canoe!
Merrily Merrily Merrily Merrily life is but a dream
If you let me back in, I promise not to sing any more 'Row, row your boat.'
Hey, hey! I'm drowning here.
You're obviously still mad about our last row.
"Nah, I don't need Waze," you said. "I know exactly where I'm going," you said.
Can you throw me a life preserver?
What do you mean your GPS said this way would be quicker?
If you keep flicking sand in my face, I won't sing the rowing song!
I still maintain that global warming is a myth cooked up by the Chinese and I'll swim this damn English Channel even if it's the last thing I do!
I said, it's my turn to row!
OK, you're right. Same bet, no handicap?
I'm drowning here!
Let's call it a draw
Won't you stop and help your fellow man when he's drowning in irony!?!
Get off my desert!
It's the journey, not the destination.
Did you think of trying a power sander?
I'm looking for Wilson. Have you seen him?
I yelled "man overboard." What's your problem?
You headed for Palm Springs by any chance?
How much longer til we reach the mirage?
It's not fair. You always get the chance to row.
Are you sure this is Crossfit?
I think we're both hallucinating.
Is the concept of water so difficult?
Are you certain Siri said to take a left back in Brooklyn?
Get real.
Did you call for an Uber?
Since climate change, is this the Atlantic or the Pacific?
Michael, it's just a song; it wasn't a request.
Watch the oars, buddy. You almost got sand in my eyes.
From now on I'm not pushing you up the hills.
The concept 'desert island' is indeed confusing.
And here I believed climate change was a hoax.
Mum sent you, didn't she! Well, tell her I'm not going back with you or anyone!
Did you remember to lock the front door.
Oh no, you've sprung a leak .
Global warming has screwed us both.
Harold, it was my turn a mile back!
Take your damn "merrily, merrily, merrily" somewhere else.
I'm distorting 'your' hallucination of reality?
Wow, that global warming turned out to be a lot worse than they said it would be.
Yes I know the way to dry land!
Got any gum?
Are you trying to make me look bad?
So, you think you can walk on water...
Rowing is nice, but I prefer hot yoga.
Request permission to come aboard, bastard.
If I hear one more round of "Row, Row, Your Boat", I'm going to slap you silly.
This is a sad excuse for a shortcut!
Please let me come aboard. I can help if you start taking on sand.
Wanna race?
For the hundredth time, I don't see an oasis.
And I thought I needed water!
No, the 'rowboat of the desert' is not actually a smaller 'ship of the desert'.
Got room for one more?
I feel like this marathon training gets more intense every year.
If you sing "Row, Row, Row Your Boat" one more time, I'll...
And where do you think you're going without me?
Could you toss me a life jacket?
Which App are you using?
Merrily Merrily Merrily Merrily life is but a dream
I told you we should have stayed in the water.
By Jove, I'll see thee hang for this ye mutinous swine!
when is this fucking acid going to wear off?
Noah....listen, you're never going to need that boat.
Maybe we should have gone to starboard back there.
You see it too?
You're just going to leave me to the sand sharks?
Have you no honor, man! It's women and children first.
Thank you,no! I would NOT like a life preserver!
Tim, we're going the same speed. Get out of the damn boat.
Ok, I'm impressed, but did you bring water?
This is not a "sea of troubles," and you're not Hamlet.
My turn!
Seriously? Better safe than sorry?!
I thought you said global warming was a myth
Your telling me you got the boat using points? And no blackout dates?
So what now Mister 'I'm-positive-it's-not-too-shallow.'?
Keep your eye out for sand sharks!
You have to admit my mirages are getting very creative.
Caught any fish lately?
Go back. It's a mirage.
There used to be a lake here.
No thanks. I'll just wait for my Uber.
That was my contact lens thank you very much.
Sorry for the wait.
You know its a mirage, right?
Any water on board?
It's Michel row the boat ashore...not on shore.
No, I said let's get some dinner and dessert!
I'd rather crawl than hear you sing "Row, row, row your boat" again...
So who's for lunch?
You make a lousy mirage!
If you're not a mirage, say something
Good News! We're the finalists in the climate skeptics games.
Oh great, you remembered to bring a boat - but not the water!
This is a no wake desert
So was it a mirage, or not?
If I hear "Row,row,row your boat" one more time....
So THAT'S why it took Moses forty years...
Hey! Are you a mirage or just a moron?
Put your back into it!
Because my shoes aren't non-marking? Are you serious!?
I can't row you fool! You know I'm prone to seasickness.
This is the last time I pick a global warming denier as a swimming coach!
That's NOT why we want water!
Next time, pray less allegorically.
See? I told you there were no sand sharks!
No no, I don't know the words to row row row your boat.
One of us is seeing a mirage and I don't think it's me.
This Guinness Record thing has gone far enough!
Hold on for a minute. My contacts lense is down here somewhere.
He was really serious about draining.
For the last time, it's just a mirage!
Stroke...stroke...I'm havin' a HEAT stroke!
Will you quit throwing sand in my face!
Don't you know that you're rowing upstream?
Hey, buddy! I have the right-of-way!
I just can't do another sea shanty, Fred
What, no life preserver?
Can you spare any of your inaginary water?
Get that surprised look off your face - you know it's my turn to row
Stop being selfish! It's my turn to row.
You said we would take turns sitting in the boat?!
If you're looking for the beach, just follow me.
No, I don't have exact change !!!
Excuse me, but either I'm in your hallucination, or you're in mine. Any preference?
I'm making just as good progress swimming.
I'm crawling as slowly as I can. If you can't keep up, row faster.
Is this my mirage or yours?
So how long have you been driving with Uber?
Disappointing mirage, eh?
We need to change the last verse to...Life is but a Nightmare!
Water, we need water.
It's time to stop rowing your boat ashore, Michael!
Get out and help me find my contact lens, or I'll show you what paddling means!
Why is it always your turn to row when we're going downhill?
You got room for two?
I was right, it's been sand the whole time.
Unfortunately it gets tougher to row during low tide.
Undrain the swamp.
Watch out! Danger ahead. Icebergs.
Do you know the way to San Jose?
I'm afraid that the desalinization project has gone too far.
The ark is supposed to be big enough for two of each kind!
Did they also tell you to never give up on your dreams?
Next time, I'm flying direct.
"Google Maps," he insisted!
The salesman said this is the ship of the desert? The camel, Eric, the camel!
This is the last time I order UberX.
Some people have all the luck!
Can’t believe this will be an Olympic event in 2020.
Hey, smart guy, your right turn signal's on!
Face facts. It was a mirage!
I thought it said this way for dessert.
Ahoy Matey, Have room for one more?
Fine! Rowing is marginally faster than crawling, I still think we should walk.
Toss me a line!
Hey! Some of us prefer dying in the desert the old fashioned way!
Have you seen MY boat?
The least you can do is throw me a life jacket.
Trust me, it's going to be bigger than spin classes.
Climate change is near.
You're in the wrong cliche, buddy.
...and this is a no-wake zone!
Is that you, Michael, rowing the boat ashore?
You've landed in a dry county.
This sunny optimism of yours is really getting on my nerves.
You wouldn't happen to be going to Barstow?
Michael, he was being sarcastic when he told you to row your boat ashore. Hallelujah.
And this time no jumping the gun. Ready? On your mark...
'...gently down the stream.' Now it's my turn.
If I knew you had a boat I'd have invited friends.
I think you're in the wrong row.
If only I had your mirage...
Coach... is this really the way you trained Michael Phelps!
Have you seen my paddleboard?
Have you read his latest tweet about global warming?
Michael, just stop it.
FedEx or Uber?
We were promised that he'd make America Great again! Now look at us!
Sand shark!
I'll row--you rest for a while
One of us is halucinating, but which one?
What makes you think the water level isn't rising?
I could have sworn I ice fished here a year ago.
What if someone sees me in that. I'd rather crawl around aimlessly.
You idiot! It's "Life is but a dream," not "And I love ice cream"
... but it's still walk & row, to me.
If you are not a mirage, toss me a line.
That's quite a mirage you've got there.
What I wouldn't give for a Pumpkin Spice latte.
Don't worry about hopping in, this boat is unsinkable.
Stop singing that song!!!
Slow down! No wake area!
Pretty good, but crawling builds your lower body, too.
I can't take it anymore, stop shouting Land Ho !"
is there room for one more
Looking backward is not the solution.
Don't expect me to sing hallelujah, Michael.
Need a coxswain?
I cant even construct a decent mirage.
Is this your dream or mine?
I told you sand sharks live in the ocean!
Watch out for turtle nests.
This boat will sink if I let you climb into it.
I think we're going the wrong way.
It's my turn in the boat.
What do you mean when is the next high tide? This is the high tide!
It wasn't a spider, Stan. Please get back in the boat, we're running late.
Do you know the score in the Manchester United - Liverpool game?
Could you stop long enough so as l can get aboard?
I bet there's no mirage up ahead either.
OK... this isn't funny anymore. It's MY turn.
Sir, I feel like I'm drowning.
Your glass-half-full mantra is really ticking me off.
You really can't get there from here.
Don't be mad. I swear I looked for you.
I can't believe it, another dry county!
I'm not going to save you if you capsize!
At least throw me a life saver for the mirage!
Someday your boat will come in.
I think we drank too much.
"Where'd you rent that?
Can I have a lift to the oasis?
Beware the white camel!
' come on, now you be the wind.'
Water, water anywhere?!
Dream on.
The conundrums of climate change
Michael, you have already owed the boat ashore.
Toward the Water! Toward the Water!!!
I'd rather crawl through the desert than ask for a hand out.
Here I am drowning and you just row right by.
OK, yes!....I need cheering up! Are there any tickets still available for the 7pm Bette Midler show on the main deck?
Race you to the next mirage, Tyrone.
I said "Desert Rose" not rows!
I can't find it...just put on your eyeglasses.
Give me a lift?
I'm crawlin' here! I'm crawlin' here!
You just had to second-guess the GPS!
Would you stop splashing me, please?
Catch anything yet?
Way to ruin the mirage.
I told you that El Nino business was baloney!
Weren't you in last week's cartoon?
Wait until the tide comes in.
Really? You come in after '...gently down the stream'!
I think its all a conspiracy of those climate change believers.
OF COURSE I`M DROWNING !
Seriously?
I guess you don't believe in climate change?
I don't care if we 're living in a post-facts society, it's not going to work.
Jesus walked on water, but you can row on land?
Slow Down! I can't keep up!
How long did it take you to get here?
Hallucinate a boat for me too please.
It's your turn to push.
I'm afraid it may be the wave of the future.
You can create your own reality but you still can't drink the water.
If this is the ocean, I'm Jesus.
a mirage is no reason for optimism.
Going my way?
Global *gasp* warming *gasp* is *gasp* a hoax *gasp*
I'm tired of dog-paddling, can I get in the boat?
Do you really want to know if I packed our toothbrushes?
Can I catch a ride ?
I know, right? What a weird place to lose a contact.
Don't worry about me, pal--a rising tide lifts all boats!
If you say something, see something.
When's it my turn to row?!!
Your part of the mirage aren't you?
Do you have any water?
Please! I'm drowning in self pity.
What say I hop a ride in your mirage to catch mine?
I don"t care that your name is Michael- it's my turn to row
great deal on that Arizona ocean front property
In your hallucination, am I doing the doggy paddle?
...the sand is getting deep...permission to come aboard
How was I supposed to know the tide went out?
I'll race you to the mirage!
Pull over for happy hour at the next sand bar.
Let me back in. I'm afraid of sand sharks.
Hallelujah already!
You ruined my mirage!
Slow down! My skis are two dunes back!
That's a hellavu mirage!
No, I do not want to get out and dry off.
Row, row your boat, gently down, the what?! The what?!
Al Gore, I presume!?
And where were you 37 years ago, when I needed you?
Desert boat? I asked for desert BOOTS!
Denier!
You must be out of your skull.
Don't just sit there, help me into the boat!
Is there anything you won't do the hard way, Leonard?
Just so I’m clear…if we win this final immunity challenge we get off the island, right?
Is now really the time for cardio?
Sorry Hank, I'm the captain.
So he was right all along-- sea levels aren't rising.
Yeah, I tried drinking it.
We are definitely still in Kansas!
Okay, it’s an Inconvenient Truth. But are the props necessary?
I said I wanted a Land ROVER for Christmas ...
You should have said you couldn't drive stick.
That be land! Land ho!
Is that one of those new Teslas?
Quick--throw me a lifesaver!
I *told* you climate change was real!
Trust me, this is not a simple matter of lightening the load.
There's an easier way, but don't take my word for it.
Are all cartoonists this sadistic?
I heard the warnings about more rapid climate change, but still I thought I had time for a swim.
You cut down the oasis trees for this?!
My phone's gotta be around here somewhere
What is life really is but a dream?
You're rowing against the tide, that's why!
Ok it's your turn to be Wilson
I know you don't believe in climate change...but ye gods !
Dude, you could at least throw me a life vest.
The message in the bottle was pretty clear... I only take Uber.
There isn't a stream and I'd say life is but a dream
Michael, just because the song says you do, doesn't mean you have to keep going!
That's no way to honor the memory of the captain we ate.
What do you mean swim back to shore?
I meant a camel you idiot!
Stroke...stroke...stroke. That's it.
Let's make this one a real head scratcher for New Yorker captioneers.
What are you—making fun of my mirage?
starbord! starboard you idiot!
Dummy, the lyrics are, "Michael rode the boat ashore, hallelujah." Not miles past the shore! TO the shore, TO the shore!
You were supposed to leave that for the women and children!
Follow me.
Either oar, I said. Either oar!
Will you please stop singing 'Row, Row, Row the boat!
This was a freshwater lake before Trump's EPA.
Hey, that's the carpool lane!
One sec - told you I'd have to get out and stretch.
You try the butterfly. I like the crawl.
Dog paddling is a lot harder than I thought
Could you stop it with the sand in my face, LEONARD?
I could go for a drink, you know a good place around here?
You forgot the beer ??!!!
Watch your wake -- I can't swim!
What part of 'gently up the stream' didn't you understand?
Forget that "merrily, merrily stuff," it's my turn to row.
Maybe now they'll take global warming seriously.
Hey! You! Global warming is a hoax and I can prove it!
Any room in there?
Well! So much for gently down the stream.
Crossfit makes me feel the burn.
Hey Man, wait up! I've been trying to catch up with you since that last mirage.
You didn't say "on your left"
Is it my turn now???
So do you think we can count n the oceans rising or are you a Trump guy?
It's about the Guinness Book of world records. You?
If I get there first, I'll bring back water.
Have you thought about an outboard?
Oh my god! Use the treadmill for once and leave me the Rowmaster.
Must be rowing against the current?
Got room for a castaway? I've been swimming for days!
No doubt persistence is why we survived at sea, all I'm saying is we reached the shore at dawn.
I can help. I rowed stroke for Harvard.
Sorry, woman and children only
When I used my one wish on a boat, I didn't know the desert island would be so big.
You said it sprang a leak!
Are we refugees yet?
Don't leave me, you know I can't swim!
OK, I am definitely the captain now.
You called the Auto Club?
SHUT UP LARRY !! I've had ENOUGH of your, dry humor jokes!!
Aye, aye Captain. Permission to come aboard?
Do I look like Jesus??
You've got to let me on board, I'm going to drown out here.
I don't care how good of a back workout it is!
I still don't think this is the English Channel.
I am NOT going to call you "Matey."
Maybe we should revisit the decision to keep the boat...
I do know "Row Row Row Your Boat", but you need three for a perpetual canon.
Sand, sand everywhere and not a sand which to eat.
Just stop calling me Sandy!
I'm waiting for the local
Still think it's a Chinese hoax?
Are you really sure this will be in the Olympics by 2024?
I yelled ‘heat stroke.’ Not ‘stroke’.
The ad I saw on TV did not say this was a side effect!
Yes, I do happen to think you can take cross training too far!
You call that gently?
Not me, I called for a Lyft.
Put on a life jacket, you moron!
There's no stream, and this is no dream.
Virtual reality would be better with some air conditioning.
Hey, this is my hallucination! You could at least pick me up!
You high-tech guys! Always in a hurry!
Damn that white whale!
Don't you know this is a no wake zone?
Maybe it's the heat talking, but this water doesn't taste as salty as I thought it would
Mother always liked you better.
Which one of us is a mirage?
Sorry, Captain, my mirage ain't big enough for the both of us.
You said the Prius wasn't eco-friendly enough and now look at us!
One of us is an hallucination.
We've got two paddles, but we're still stuck up s$&t's creek!
First you were a climate change denier, and now this!
I'm still going to win!
Don't worry, he said. We'll find land, he said.
Really! Why don't you just flap those oars and FLY OUT OF HERE!
Forget the nav system. Let's just walk.
It's a mirage you jackass. And where the hell did you get a boat anyhow?
Race you to the next oasis.
OK, I think you've proven your point about the liquid-like qualities of sand.
For God's sake, man, get your tropes straight!
You Millennials are always taking shortcuts!
I saw a phone booth. You paddle, I'll direct. Do you have a dime?
Maybe global warming ISN'T a hoax.
No! You’re supposed to sing ‘”Gently down the stream” at the same timeI sing “Life is but a dream
Still think crossing the border by land and sea is such a poetic way to flee the inauguration, Walt Whitman?
Beats driving in LA.
At least throw me a life jacket!
Yield to the right!
No life jacket? Well, that's dangerous!
Can you stop splashing sand in my fac
Maybe it's a metaphor for how ugly and dangerous things have become.
I'm tired of swimming, it's my turn to row.
Technology is not the answer for everything.
Say "not a drop to drink" one more time...I dare you!
Hey! Who's mirage is this?
Can you please stop singing Proud Mary?
You only had ONE job!
Look where you are rowing !#%*!
This gives a new meaning to: "Michael rowed the boat ashore."
When are you going to stop worrying about getting back your deposit on the boat?
You and your goddamned optimism!
Sing that one more time, and that paddle's going right up your stern.
You're late.
OK. OK. It was a mirage. Do you really have to rub it in?
Your mirage keeps paddling sand in my face!
Repeal was easy, replace is hard.
Why do you always pass me by?
I'm begging you... give me a ride!!!
You should've turned left at the dry river bed.
Sure, "life is but a dream" you. You've got the boat.
I don't believe in global warming.
I think I feel a fish.
No, I don't need a #**$#@ life preserver!
Hey buddy - the passing lane is on the right!
That genie gave you one wish!
How about we switch it up when we hit the coast?
Wanna trade places ?
When I said we needed a ship of the desert ...
At least I"m not taking this sitting down!
You can have any kind of mirage you want, but at least have the decency not to row sand in my face.
I need to find the ring or she won't let me back in the house.
I said use your core!
...Hey, get your boat out of my garden!...
I will not sing another verse of "row, row, row your boat!"
Still a skeptic of global warming, huh?
I guess you need water too...
With all due respect, Mr. President, I'm happy to report that The Clean Water Act was successfully repealed.
You said high tide was coming!
No, I don't have a propeller.
You global-warming deniers sure are consistent.
Take it easy, it's just a mirage.
You could at least throw me a life preserver.
Forgive me, I didn't actually abandon the ship, I just wanted to stretch my legs.
Can you PLEASE put more emotion into your part! Believe me, "The Old Man and the Sand" is going to be a huge box office success and win us both an Oscar!!!!
Now you're just being a jerk!
If I hear any more "Michael Row the Boat Ashore", it won't be pretty.
At long last ... a stroke of good luck.
Dammit. Looks like we had the same hallucination.
I may crawl, and you may stroke, but we're both going to croak.
He won?
Ahoy, matey! Any chance you be looking for water too?
I thought I told you to bring the JEEP!
These new fitness crazes are getting out of hand.
Now do you believe me about the drought?
I don't care if its vintage Chris-Craft.
Hey! You know you're supposed to stay at least 5 yards from free swimmers!
Paddle or no paddle - we're up sh•t's creek.
The lake is back the other way.
No, for your information, I am not dog paddling.
Did you just shout 'sand ahoy'?
C'mon, Eric, let me back in. I promise, no more back-seat rowing!
Do you take credit cards?
No, I don't want to sing it as a round this time!
Peleo or Atkins?
Still think it's all a hoax Frank?
Dammit, Bob: I am NOT a hitchhiker - let me in!
As I said at my confirmation hearing, I 'm still sure the scientists are wrong.
Last one to the oasis is a rotten egg.
Do younger brothers ALWAYS have to compete?
Departing of the Red Sea....some miracle!
Okay, I'll row and YOU ski.
I'll stop doing the crawl stroke when you stop rocking the boat.
To you, maybe, it's 'but a dream.'
I'll take my chances with the sharks!
Let me pass. You are messing with my mirage.
Are we clear on the bet? GO!
Even if global warming IS a fallacy, you can't row without water.
You always win.
By chance, have you seen Wilson.
You'll get your just deserts!
How many espressos did you say you had before jumping into the lifeboat?
When I was singing, "Michael Row Your Boat Ashore" I didn't mean all the way to the damn desert.
Okay, take me to the more realistic mirage.
Okay, but this is the last time. Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream...
Okay, leave without me. But I'm reporting your lack of life jackets.
The moment when Louis and Clark realized they took a wrong turn.
Get off your knees, Mr. Gore. No matter how much you beg, you're not going to convince me that global warming is real!
We hit the shore a long time ago, Michael!
You're hogging all the imaginary water!
What's with the desert with no island?!?
Michael, is that really you?
Michael! Stop rowing the boat ashore!
It is your turn to do the fishing.
Don't you see I'm drowning!!
A canoe would have been so much easier.
Oh I see, very nice.. Mr Fancy Sand Boat with Fancy Sand Oars...
I'm starting to question your grip on reality!
What about changing places? I'll row and you'll swim!
What do you mean you forgot what you went for!
You get your exercise your way, and I'll get mine my way.
They were out of tabasco sauce.
I'm tired of hearing about CrossFit.
In hindsight, vacationing on a desert island was probably not the best choice.
Guess I took 'Michael row the boat ashore' a bit too literal.
Splash me again and I will rock your boat.
Watch it! I'm swimmin' here!
See? Global warming is a myth.
Get out, it's my turn to play in the boat
You know Stan, this year's office retreat may finally be the one that breaks me.
Rent is cheap, and with a couple of podcasts you don’t even notice the commute.
We would row a lot faster if you would help me find the anchor!
I guess this would be called sailing the low seas.
You do realize that you are ship out of luck?
I just wanted a Klondike bar.
Feels like old times, doesn't it?
Oasis? Boy are you lost!
Didn't they warn you? It never rains in California
What time do we need to return the beach chairs?
For God's sake, stop singing that song!"
your rowing in a mirage,you idiot!
"Survivor" has officially run out of ideas.
No wake!
It sure took you long enough after the man overboard signal was given.
One more chorus of that infernal song, and I'll row, row, row you into a sandy grave.
No Professor I don't see any icebergs ahead and would you stop calling me Ginger?
Is that so? I'll remind you that one man's dream is another's nightmare.
One man crawls and another man rows into a sand bar . . .
I request permission to come aboard, sir.
Can I please be part of your mirage?
No, you should have taken a left at the fork.
Denying Global Warming doesn’t make it go away, you know.
Ahoy? Gimme a break.
and then I'm going to hand you your "merrily, merrily" ass!
I thought global warming was a hoax.
Will you stop critiquing my breast stroke?
I told you you went the wrong way
Don't look now, but you are going in the wrong direction.
Nice Shirt.
Noah, this isn't what He was talking about!
I always wondered who was responsible for the crop circles
Still think climate change is bull Ahab.
When I said "Send me a life boat," this isn't what I meant.
DAMMIT Michael - 'ashore' - why do you always HAVE to be such an over-achiever?!
I just think it's a bit selfish, that's all.
I'll circle back one more time, see if you didn't drop it back there!
OK! If you say so, global warming exists. Now can you let me back in before I drown?
The US after new immigration policy is implemented
Really, you christened it "Boaty McBoatface"? That's so 2016.
Why don't you just face global warming like the rest of us?
Life's about a dream? Hand me that oar...
That's a tough way to land the merit badge.
Must you keep humming 'Michael rowed the boat ashore?'
No Carl! Right now life is but a horrific nightmare!
Jesus, shouldn't you be walking on the water?
Slow Down! This is a low wake zone.
We won! We found the source of Trump Natural Spring Water!
It may be faster if I swim
You always take the easy way.
According to my GPS there's a row-thru burger place over the next dune.
Your sense of humor needs some work.
You're taking your mirages a bit too seriously!
The lifesaver I understand, but why toss out the sunscreen?
I said "Go to hell!", not "Row to hell!"
Yes, as a matter of fact I do think the irony is 'a bummer'
You’re rowing? I’m drowning!
If we teamed up for a double skull we should get out of here twice as fast.
I've never seen a sand bar this big.
......merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily....this has GOT to be a dream!
Are you sure we haven't finished the channel crossing?
I'm staying here until you start rowing at a less reckless speed.
Are you absolutely sure we're doing this right ?
I'm gonna be honest with you here; when you told me about this Egyptian boating trip, this was not what I was expecting.
You're not the smartest Uber driver, are you?
Do you think I could get a lift? I'm up here without a paddle.
You need water, dumbass!
This is one heck of a sand bar isn't it?
One of us is hallucinating this and I hope it's you.
There is no Ozymandias! It's a metaphor! You have rowed us right into a metaphor!
Sorry to tell you mate, but the mirage is over.
No I'm not getting in, I want a real ship of the desert
Your optimism has overtaken your sanity.
Sorry, I drank it all.
Any chance you still need a coxswain?
It's my turn now, dammit.
Never get out of the boat.
I was varsity coxswain in "82, I swear it will help your rhythm!
Do you mind, I'm dog paddling.
Let me in! We'll go faster.
Is this the rising tide that Trump promised?
If it isn't the SS Overachiever.
So where did you find the boat?
Bermuda? Just follow me, I'm swimming there.
Oh give up!, ...we haven't passed water in three days.
Look, I don't care who won the coin toss ---- you don't get to row forever.
What do you mean, you forgot the tow-rope?
Got any water skis? I can show you some tricks.
We need to rethink this Run and Row biathlon idea.
No life jackets?
How many miles must a man row in vain, before they call him insane? The answer my friend is a coxswain in the wind...
My nose got sunburnt when I did the backstroke, so I'm trying the crawl.
Well aren't you just the optimist!
Are we in an Al a-Gore-y for the consequences of climate change?
Because I'm not the one who insisted we didn't have to check the gas in the outboard, that's why!
Life is *not* but a dream.
Any port in a storm, eh...
Mirage, Hell. Stop the Boat!
Retired huh? I don't have any oars in the water either.
I'm not drinking it because it's SALT water, you idiot!
Enough with the splashing, Ahab!
Can you please slow down?
"Hey pal,could you back up a bit? You're blocking my view.
Just stop! Don't you see I'm drowning.
The sign clearly stated "No boating allowed!"
How much farther to the Aral Sea?
"No, I did not say row for help".
Holy Moses!
I was at a restaurant and they asked me if I wanted dessert, what's your story?
Get out. It's your turn to play the anchor.
No, I have not seen a white whale!
I don't think I can make it. Can you pull me onboard?
Everywhere I go, traffic's at a flippin' crawl.
That song was wrong, life is not a dream!
I don't see this sand-shark you keep mentioning.
Where on earth did you rent that thing?
What's your definition of rescue!
Just because you don't know how to swim doesn't mean you shouldn't get out of your boat and try!
I KNEW YOU'D RUN IT AGROUND!
Freshman physics says I'm going to win.
For God's sake, stop with the "row, row, row your boat"!
At least you won't have a problem with barnacles.
We've been off course for 24 hours and you just noticed it now?
I don't care how you meant it. Your tone was entirely condescending!
Hopefully we are both going in the right direction
Homeless. Will row for water. God Bless.
Where's the fire?
Can't you at least throw me a life preserver.
Just give me three more strokes and we're there.
Don't I know you!
"You" crawl. It's "my" turn to row!
I don’t care what the Weather Channel says!
The sign back there clearly states "SWIMMERS ONLY " along this section the beach!
I think we're good on the dry dock testing.
I told you to use the GPS!
Jerry, will you please, just once have a dream that makes sense?
Are you sure this is how Diana Nyad trained?
Slow down buddy!
How about you? Do you have any regrets about joining this boot camp?
Of course we're not up a creek without a paddle. It's the water we're missing!
Moses came through months ago and they're still giving the old directions?
YES! I think it's fair to say you overshot the beach some time ago!
No, dammit, this time it's YOUR turn to get out and push!
How about tossing a life vest over here?
Heads or tails, indeed!
But where did you find the oars?
It's not a mirage! Climate change is real.
Can we finally put this positive visualization exercise to rest?
Got milk?
Can you cut it out with the "Water Ho!" crap!
Hey! This here is a swimmers only zone, you're supposed to be over on that side of the mirage.
It's my turn. It was my idea!
one of us is a mirage
Stroke! . . . Stroke! . . . Stroke! . . .
Have you seen water?
Does it look like I would happen to have a spare anchor?
Do you need a lift?
Global warming, global schmarming.
Thanks for the tip: Instead of the crawl, I'll switch to the back stroke.
Leave the boat, take the cannoli!
Hey, I'm struggling here! Would you mind going around?
We want a ship of the desert you idiot. A SHIP!
And you said it would be tough sledding!
Mind if I catch a ride!
Excuse me.
"Ashore," Michael, not "Some more"!
That ship sailed a long time ago!
Your mirage is way bigger than mine!
Damn you coastal elites and your yachts!
Please let me back in. I promise not to make any more, "You know you're an idiot when..." jokes.
Race you to the next mirage!
Throw me a rope!
Easy there, captain, this is a no wake zone!
How long have you been on death row?
I'm telling you, you don't need to worry about losing your damn sea legs.
God you're one ugly hallucination, aren't you?
Landlubber
Could you toss me the life preserver?
Why do I get the feeling you're trying to avoid me?
I'll row!
The paddling is tough, but no waves to worry about.
I finally found an optimist in 2017! After 2016, I didn't think you existed.
Weren't you on the Yale crew at Henley in '99?
When are you going to to accept that not only have you got the measurements wrong, but the weather forecast too, Noah?
Don't leave me to drown, skipper.
Oh, CRAWLING to your death not good enough for you, eh?
Out of my way ... OAR else!
You guessed it. My rowboat sprang a leak.
I thought global warming was supposed to increase water levels.
One more paddle to the face and we are going to play Captain Phillips.
At least you weren't swimming when the flash drought occurred.
Sand, Sand everywhere and not a camel in sight.
I told you the science on global warming wasn't a hoax.
LET'S TRADE PLACES!
My life is not just a dream.
You're an idiot.
I told you it only looks like water!
I thought your rates might be lower at low tide.
Water, water, NOWHERE and not a drop to drink!
Not funny.
Tell me you still deny global warming
Hit me in the face one more time?? -- Don't make me come over there!
Brag all you want, but you're thirsty too!
You will drown in hell for not taking me aboard!
Wait here. I have to go back to the parking lot --- I left my sunscreen in the car.
All you bought was Sun Block?
Are you coming or going?
Sure, you think you need water.
Dude we both are high and dry!
Watch that oar, buster.
"Natural cycle," eh?
Got any sunscreen?
You have passed me three times and you still haven't offered me a ride !
You could at least pretend I'm not a mirage.
You're out of water too!
Suspend your own disbelief, Dude!
We're saved! High tide is coming!
Looks like paddles don't really matter when you find yourself 'up the creek.'
Roadhog!
As far as mirages go, it's not that funny.
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily.
OK, now I'll row and you swim.
Sorry mate, I only have one life vest.
He's not MY president!
It's not my fault, they said to rent a "ship of the desert"!
At least you could throw me a lifeline!
You win, alright?
I'm starting to think that this climate change thing isn't a hoax
I won. So not fair!
I'd be way ahead of you if it weren't for that last mirage.
Yeah life is but a dream alright - a really bad dream!
You kept saying it's just hard water, but I don't think you even know what that means, do you?
For the last time, I don't need a lifejacket!
Now do you regret voting for Donald Trump?
When we get there, first round's on me.
Hey, stop splashing.
I'm angry because you're rowing in circles!
Nest time, I'll call an Uber.
Weren't we supposed to be borne back ceaselessly into the past by now?
I do believe in global warming, I do believe in global warming...
You mean all this time I was swimming?
I thought you said rowing uphill was a metaphor.
You and your power of positive thinking!
Sing something new for goodness sake! We've had "row row row your boat" for the last 5 miles!
I *told* you climate change was real!
do you think that we exaggerated the idea of living as far as possible from Trump's America?
I booked "Sierra" not " Sahara".
You are not the dreamboat mirage I was hoping for.
We would have gotten twice as far if you'd let me in!
Did it ever occur to you that I might like to be in the driver's seat for once?
Vegas, eh?
Hang a left at the dry river bed!
Your not having both oars in the water would matter a lot less if there WAS some water.
We are all on the same impossible journey
I told you we should've turned left at Albuquerque!
"Dear God, man, don't you get that "sea of sand" is a metaphor?
No wake please!
What do you mean, we're saved?
I could have told you Barry, your degree in maritime engineering was really useless..
As bad as this is at least there's no sharks to worry about !
For the last time, I haven't seen the marina!
Wrong mirage, dude. It's an oasis, not an island.
I know it looks bad, but we're all in the same boat.
I bet we both wish this mirage had water.
Will a rising tide lift your boat too?
Sadly, life is not but a dream...
Try denying this!
You were supposed to go left at the fork
Some guys have all the luck!
They believe it now
So this is what Trump meant about making America great again.
Michael, you already proved your point. This is just overkill!
You're hurting the endangered Delhi Sand Fleas!
Neil Young. You?
Do you ever wish we hadn't made that bet?
Say Michael, don't you think this is taking "Row your boat ashore" a little too far
Wait a sec -- what if we switched and YOU looked for water and I looked for land?
will you just leave the boat!!! the water is not that deep
Waddayamean you wouldn't save me if I was drowning?
If you'd just let me put on the sail, I"m sure we'd be home by now!
Could you tell me where the nearest sand bar is?
Great plan Ineptune.
I don't have the norovirus!
I told you, this is not what ship of the desert means.
Remember when the lakes had water and I would do the freestyle alongside you? Now i just do the crawl
i'm creating a smaller carbon footprint this way.
I can't swim any faster.
If I knew where the next oasis was, I wouldn't tell you!
You say, "now I am captain", or "thar she blows", one more time, and!?
I told you to bring water!
Hey Fella, watch where you're goin!
Really owning that 'climate change is a hoax' theory, eh Gary?
Screw it. I still haven't been paid for the last motivational poster I was in.
Have you a barber on board, sir?
Sand,sand everywhere,but not a grain to eat.
No, no, no, it's 'stream', 'gently down the stream'!
I suppose you think I'm a buoy!
Oh, now it's SEA HO!
"I told you to wait for high tide"!
Hank! I just realized you've been singing it all wrong--it's "gently down the STREAM!"
Yeah yeah life is but a dream, can I catch a ride?
I told you to only sing that song when you're gently down the stream!
I told you not to row so fast!!
And I thought it was silly when the olympics reinstated golf!
The sea was angry that day, my friend.
I just saw something like this in The New Yorker. Talk about derivative!
Michael, quit rowing. Didn't you hear the music stop?
To think I used to enjoy when the days started getting longer.
No, it's not any wetter over here!
I told you the mirage was too shallow!
Still believe we need the boat Gus?
I already told you; you're not getting back on this boat until you admit Manfred Mann's version was better.
Get out of the carpool lane!
Hold up a minute ...i need a water break!
SO! Where have YOU been?
Just what I need, a smartass.
Hey, buddy! The rule is "Leave No Trace."
You always were dingy.
We've been looking for days! I told you to insure that ring.
... Life is but a dream.
You need to take that oar down deep or you're not going anywhere.
How big are these sand traps on this golf course?
I think its about time you stop poopo-ing global warming...
I can help with the rowing!
It was "man overboard" miles ago!
Hey, look! I'm grovelling! What a fucking surprise!
If I've told once, I've told you a thousand times. Enough with the "Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream...there is no stream!"
Throw me a rope before I drown in this mirage.
Just exactly what is it you don't understand about no "wake" zone ?
No passing!
Ashore not onshore!
I'll race ya to the next mirage.
Quit telling me ‘The medium is the message.’
Will you PLEASE stop humming "Anchors Aweigh"?
I can't tread sand either.
Jesus may be able to walk on water, but this guy can row a boat on land.
Thanks, but I can do without your running commentary on my crawl stroke.
Now I know I'm definitely going the wrong way.
I'll beat you yet, dagnabbit, God willin' and the creek don't rise!
Can you see the rising tide? I heard it's going to be huge.
Why didn't you tell me this mirage was so long?
Please stop singing!
I promise I'll stop pretending to be your coxswain if you let me back in the boat.
I guess you did not plan for global warming Noah, Jr.
It's a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese!
Does this mean I am kneeling on water?
I feel you, brother. How do you think I ended up here.
Are you at sea or am I?
This All-Inclusive Resort looked better in the brochure.
You say, "there's no global warming?"
I said Land HO not Sand Row
i'm telling you. The shortest distance between two points, isn't always the best choice.
Slow down, buddy. You want to kill somebody.
How long have you been waiting at this stoplight?
This is not merrily down the stream!
I HATE positive thinking!
Jesus Kyle seriously there's not even any fucking water. We're going to die
When do I get to row/
I know I said you should get on a SLOW boat to China!
It's my turn to sing, 'Row, row, row your boat!'
I think Canada is the other way.
Women and children only
You're headed in the right direction. Just keep going straight and you'll find the mirage.
Right technique. Wrong geological period.
Michael, row your boat ashore already!
Water, Ho.
You're rowing in a sanctioned crawlspace.
One more time, Land ho!
I'll keep you company on the condition you don't make me row.
See? I told you global warming was a myth.
I'm exhausted! It's time to switch places.
One of us made a wrong turn!
That is NOT what they meant by "ship of the desert."
Come on, sing with me dude, "The ocean is a desert with it's life underground..."
What do you mean you only have room for one?
Sitting is the new smoking.
Hey. No wake!
Forget water; I'd kill for a virtual reality headset.
For the last time, the lyric is 'a HORSE with no name,' not 'a BOAT.'
Let me think. Nope. You're the first racer I've seen.
Agree to disagree. Just quit splashing.
Life jacket?
Whatever floats your boat.
If you're going to keep rowing I'm going to start swimming.
I don't care if I'm getting a sunburn on my scalp. I'm not doing the backstroke.
I guess you were wrong. I think that the ship of the desert is a camel.
STOP ROWING!!!
This global warming, sea rise thing, better hurry up.
Don't come crawling to ME when you develop hemorrhoids!
Mom always liked you best!
Compared to this, the Channel swim was a breeze
Hello there. Might I offer my services as a coxswain?
Still not admitting it's not 'just a sand bar'?
We must become the wave we've been looking for.
I hope you remembered the sun screen.
"Row, row, row your boat"...LIFE IS BUT A DREAM!
What do you mean, you forgot the map?!
If you sing "Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily" one more time...
You're not the girl from my hallucination.
Are you the guy with UBER?
Damnit, you've mixed my metaphor!
You're gonna look ridiculous when I find a sailboat and let the wind do all the work.
OK. I'll shut up about global warming being a fraud if you admit you'd kill for an outboard motor!
Did you say "a tough row to hoe" or a "tough row to row"?
Can I catch a ride ?
You really need to work on your feathering!
Get out of my sand sculpture!
This is not what they mean by "Row, row, row your boat"!
When are you going to tell me what you mean by"Fake News"
Row, row, ... merrily, merrily ... ? Get out of my dream!
Dammit, Earl, get off my beach towel!
Mirage? Now you tell me you think it's all a mirage?
No, I will not help you bail.
Don't forget...my turn comes when we see land.
And I suppose you sold the last of our vitamin water to pay for it!
Draw a big Amazon Echo --- it'll mess with the Google Earth people
I told you not to fire the coxswain!
I warned you about rapid climate change!
Stop rowing!You're only encouraging them to come up with more of these preposterous 'lost in the desert' cartoons.
Michael, why must you always be so literal?
What do you mean you forgot the arugula???
I'm pretty sure that we're both in the 99%.
There was water here yesterday
"You should at least, give me a head start".
Dammit, it's my turn to row.
This must be that climate hoax I've been hearing about.
You can stop rowing now!!
I told you not to pull the plug out!
Now you tell me.
You win. Oars beat hands and knees.
Really, because it's good for your core?
For Gods sake ! who thought it a good idea to put the government in charge of the oceans ?
Whale? Haven't seen any.
I'm sorry I incessantly kept reminding you that we were both in the same boat together.
Still think global warming isn't real?
You are going in the wrong direction.
Climb aboard fast. These are sand shark infested waters.
Damn! We are in the wrong mirage!
I ordered an UberX, not an UberDinghy.
Thanks. But I think I'm better off out of the boat.
I tried to tell you climate change was real. Do you believe me now?
Optimism in the face of the improbable is admirable, but in the face of the impossible is just foolish.
Just admit it. It's been getting warmer.
And I thought Uber was a long wait
Threw me overboard and see where it got you!
How far to the oasis?
Face it. Imagining won't get you a river.
Must your always go against the grain?
This CrossFit gift you gave me is the worst Christmas present ever.
You got any ChapStick with aloe vera or SPF 30?
What took you so long? I called uber over an hour ago.
You ain't got both oars in the water!
I told you not to make that sharp turn off the ocean!
Can you please tell me when the next high tide comes in?
Democrat Party headquarters?
Stroke! Stroke! Stroke!
I told you there was no oasis. But NOOOOOO!
Are you available for charter.
What's the hurry? This is all there is left of your Trump's Great America
Help, I'm caught in an undertow.
Couldn't you have arranged for a dune buggy?
It could have been worse.
Well if you had an outboard motor I WOULD get in. Now be on your way!
Could we take turns? I'm exhausted.
I don't care what the geologists say, it's a desert now.
Get in. This hybrid runs on water AND solar
I told you in the beginning it wasn't going to be all beer and skittles
You forgot the snorkle?
You know one of us does not have any idea of the gravity of the situation!
Anything new with global warming research?
Do you have a towel?
Is it too much to ask that my mirage include water?
Sorry, pal, did I interrupt your stream of drought?
Sure wish we'd missed the boat!
I don't know which of us is the mirage, but yeah, I'd say the tide is rising.
Merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream!
You're 130 million years too late.
You do realize we're in California, right?
Amazon can do a lot of things but it can't change water into sand!
This is NOT UberSelect
Ever heard of signaling when passing?
Would you like sparkling, tap or ocean?
Only trigonometry can save us now.
Can I row now? Swimming is not my thing.
so this is what they mean by the dry heaves
Throw me a life preserver.
I told you global warming was for real.
Hey, there! Going my way?
This isn't working for me. Can I try your mirage?
Another round of "Row Row Your Boat" and Imwill strangle you!
Why yes, the weather has been a bit unusual.
Do you need directions or do I ?
Need a lift?
I'm tired of Row, Row, Row Your Boat! I want to sing something different!
Hey, that's MY mirage!
Told you " There's no GLOBAL WARMING & Oceans aren't rising"
Hop on board! I see land...
Overachiever!
Find your own mirage.
Would you stop singing that song?! It's making me thirsty!
I still say, it’s a hoax.
Stroke!
I told you not to come in a boat.
Yes it is dry here too - I think you can get out of the boat.
Smack me with an oar; Anything, to let me know you are real.
But Trump promised he'd build a lake here,
I have the best surf. My surf is tremendous.
Dr. Livingstone, I presume?
Two new-year resolutions: diet and exercise.
Haven't you heard of global warming!
Am I seeing a mirage or are you?
We should have turned left back there in Las Vegas.
Is it my fault you went a little overboard?
If you find any sand sharks, let me know.
I always thought the Navy had it better.
I think time would be easier if we'd just walk.
You're seriously going to make me crawl?
Damn it Bob, Life is NOT a dream!
It's all a liberal conspiracy.
For the last time. I am not named Michael!
Take your next left....
I asked for a camel, not a metaphor.
I feel like our relationship is kind of in a rut these days.
Throw me a life vest!
I think it's Tuesday.
It's all paddle drive with off water capabilities
Hoping for climate change are we!
Looks like we're using the same GPS locator. Next time we look at a map.
Toss me a life preserver!
Sand,sand everywhere,but not a grain to eat.
No. No. No! It's Adam SANDler. You're the worst at this game!
We have definitely hit rock bottom
Stop Already!
I said, no! I'm waiting for God to save me.
I'm the king of the world!
I don't think this is " The Mirage" we wanted to visit!
This isn't a race!
- if there's anything I can't stand, it's a show off -
Any chance you have the number for Life Alert?
Still like those coal stocks for your portfolio?
I said stroke, not heatstroke!
you're taking this mirage thing a little too far
I wish you'd stop slapping me in the face with that thing
Can you direct me to a dark cloud?
Hey man, got any bottled water ?
Have you seen my lobster trap?
Why don't we just fish here?
I just started reading Boys In the Boat...Don't ruin it for me
As far as mirages go, I give you a two.
It may be a mirage, but I'm still willing to share with the rowing.
Sorry man, I already have a hard road to row.
Need… water…” “Yeah, tell me about it.
Yeah, I can see you're the original Roads Sculler.
Hey, man, look at the color of your nose. Didn't you ever hear of sunscreen?
This is what happens when you don't check your GPS
Stop calling me Jesus, dude. This is sand.
Row, Row, Row your boat gently while I scream!
Calm deserts don't make for good sailors either John.
I guess you really do get what you pay for.
Some of us care about our emissions, sir.
Moses?
This could be the end of a beautiful friendship.
If it weren't for climate change this would make a lot of sense.
Come on, let's trade places.
It's your turn to push.
So, it's just a mirage, huh?
Gently down what stream?
Ed! Rowing is no longer helping us!
You still want to tell me sea levels are rising?
I can't remember my password!
DAMN !
No, I will not help you row!
Sure, buddy! No problem! I love yielding!
Go find your own cliché!
I lost my water skiis.
Hey,Noah called he said he wants his dingy back.
Sand, sand everywhere, yet not one drop to drink!
Get your mirage out of my way!
Global Warming has really slowed the "'English Channel Swim."
You'd better be a mirage!
I don't think we're getting anywhere. Let me row the boat
Life of pi
Again, I say No! The religious imagery of The Old Man and the Sea is not autochthonous when evident in the context of Hemingway's earlier works!
What did I tell you ?! See, it was a mirage and not real water!
You wanted a "Ship of the Desert"!!
I told you the GPS doesn't work in the ocean. Now look where it got us!
Sir, may I drink from your mirage?
YOU KNOW WHO I MEAN , THE GUY YOU USED TO MAKE FUN OF. I BELIEVE HIS NAME IS GORE .
Is this because I wouldn't carpool with you?
Hey, you should always row with the current, never against it
I still don't get how that mirage was real for one of us
If life is but a dream, this is a nightmare.
Where's your rod and reel, Einstein?
This isn't making the desert great again!
Can't you at least throw me a lifesaver?
Can I stop swimming now?
If only this life was but a dream.
Your optimism is maddening.
Well, going upstream without water and two paddles is certainly harder than going upstream without a paddle.
Ok, I get it. My only job was to call 'Land Ho', but you're just being petty now.
The only living things I've encountered are sand sharks.
You seen a gold wristwatch anywhere?
Oh, just throw me the damn life preserver.
OK. Now it's your turn to push!
REALLY?? No such thing as global warming you say!!
By any chance do you happen to have an accordion on board?
You could throw me a lifeline, you know.
Well, better than being up this creek without a paddle I guess
Please tell me you're not a Kardashian.
Isn't that cheating?
Sand, sand everywhere and not a grain to eat
You do realize that it is my turn to row.
"How about, 'Sand, sand, everywhere, but not a bite to eat'"?
Any more sand in my face, I'm taking over the oars.
Jump in the sand is great
Swimming in this is no fun either!
For the last time, stop singing that infernal song! Life is NOT but a dream!
This is exactly why I voted for Trump.
Can you please explain to me how merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is anything but a nightmare?
Do you really have to keep humming that infernal song?
Oh, so this is Uber Desert...?
Do I look like I have a dune buggy?!
You climate-change deniers are taking this too far!
You knocked over my mirage!
Why don't we switch for a while. The sand is really hot now.
Chinese hoax?
Out of the whole damn desssert you have to row here?
When's my turn?
Please tell me you're launching, not beaching.
I'm not a mirage! The water - THAT'S the mirage.
If I THOUGHT I needed a rescue at sea, I' have HALLUCINATED one, Okay?
So what if I can't walk on water?
Let them drink wine!
You realize that your in a "no wake zone".
Either I get in the boat or you're on your own!
Sorry to bother you, but do you have any toilet paper I could borrow?
We'll never get to that oasis if you can't row straight!
I kelp telling you, it's a MIRAGE!
Well at least throw me a life preserver!
Hallelujah, Michael, but where's the milk and honey?
Well, I'm an agnostic. I just don't know...
Sure, times are tough. But my taxes have never been lower!
Maybe you should re-calculate when rising sea levels will float your boat over the Wall.
I thought you said sea levels will rise, Noah.
What do you mean, "a SMALL leak?"
Headed to Mecca?
I've had it! I'll never be in another desert cartoon!
Get outa there it's my turn to row!
OK, your turn to crawl now.
"Would you PLEASE quit singing "Row, row , row your boat"?
Fling me the life perverser!
Hey, get your own mirage!
Do you care if I get eaten by sharks?
I got shipwrecked in a sandstorm.
Waiting for El Nino?
Check your privilege!
Last one to the bar buys
Stop! It's my turn to keep our minds off our situation.
Pardon me, have you seen any climate scientists? I would like to have a word with them.
It'seems your turn to swim.
Just so you know, Climate Change is a myth!
No thanks, I have faith. I'm waiting for the helicopter.
We were supposed to be swimming the English Channel.
Now you're just showing off.
What rapids?
Let me guess. You’re a comedian AND a weatherman.
I want some even more than you do.
I am not DENYING Climate Change,but the boat IS premature!!
Hey! How about a little help!
Yes, still a mirage.
I've been swimming? I can swim?
Do you think we are taking this Method Acting thing too far, or not far enough?
you are leaking sand!
So, a 'cruise for climate-change skeptics' sounded like fun, huh?
The Uber app ain't what it used to be.
I am beginning to think there may something to this global warning stuff.
You may get there first, but the oasis is a mirage.
Nope, 'finding dory' still not funny.
When I see Moses again...
Carpool lane?
Actually Steve, I think you're holding it wrong.
You ran aground? I can barely crawl.
If you hit me with that oar one more time, I'll show you 'gently' and 'merrily'!
You're STILL in surge pricing?
Climate change is near.
Life is anything but a dream with you, Winston.
Even with a Trump win, it may take the rising sea level several months to catch up with you.
I'm not fooled, boy -- I know a mirage when I see one!
I tell you, climate change is real! And stop asking for more bait!
I'm telling you, global warming is real!
Don't ever mention Tony Robbins to me again!
Get out of my mirage.
Did you remember to re-apply sun screen?
I just want to sit on the gunwale and get the sand out of my shoes and shorts.
Enough with that "merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily"!
Michael, can you spare some sunblock?
Just because you rowed at Harvard doesn't mean you get to row all the time!
You do Everything the Hard Way
That's it! One more, "Row, row, row your boat" and I paddle.
You know, Hell's actually not as bad as everyone says.
You trying to kill me with that wake?
Have you seen my goggles?
Yes, I agree, you ARE more lost than me.
Enough already with the "Row, row, row your boat..."
can I borrow some sun screen?
Sand, sand everywhere and not a bite to eat
No you idiot, row the OTHER way!
I'm pretty sure it's a mirage
Have you ever seen a longer beach?
Ok ok, I'll pay the surge pricing just let me in!
The boat's still too heavy. We need to figure a way to row with BOTH of us outside the boat.
You called for a lift?
Turn around and grab the skis... I just have to keep my knees bent.
Stroke! Stroke! Heatstroke!
I thought "a sea of sand" was a metaphor!
We all need water like it or not..
You can't row here! Didn't you see the buoys?
Moses,you parted the sand, not the sea.
Give me a lift. I know where you can a motor cheap.
Is it me or is this entire ocean a mirage?
No more fake news!
This way is a lot faster, you know,
I once had your dream of captaining my own ship, but it turn out to be a mirage. You will soon learn that life's a beach.
Do you think I'll be safe from the sharks?
Need any ballast?
You mind maybe giving me a push, I think I'm stuck on something.
'Sorry, can't take you in. I am already finding rowing hard'
First class available?
You need a haircut.
Row a little faster-I feel a sprint coming on.
Can you not destroy the delicate biological crust.
Did anyone tell you that's the hard way?
You think you're so smart.
No matter how hard Gerald begged, Daryl would not let his mouth-breathing companion back in the boat.
Because I detest mixed metaphors, that's why.
You left the share lane two dunes ago.
No, I don't know where the nearest lake is.
I'm surprised you didn't bring the fishing rod.
no, no, no. You're doing it all wrong
I get it. You don't believe in climate change. But that's not going to bring back the lake.
I can't believe the coincidence that we both came to Antarctica years ago to study the controversy of climate change.
You forgot to bring wine??
Hey, why don't you get your own mirage!
Hey, buddy....Slow No Wake!!
I've heard that global warming is accelerating but this is ridiculous!
Hallelujah.
This is how I usually do it.
''Hashtag Global Warming”
Best two out of three?
Hey! When we escaped from the asylum it was agreed that I would do the driving.
Don't you just love contests?
Despair sinners, the flood is coming!!
Maybe next time you will believe me when I say it is just a mirage!
I'm ready to go back to the ocean -- you?
We are entering a dead zone.
Hi, I'm Noah. Got room for me and a few other passengers?"
Damn millennials!
Have you gone mad? It was my turn to row fifteen minutes ago!
Are you sure this is the best way to train for the 1500m freestyle?
How far until the next restroom?
Just forget about early voting.
I hope we're on the same page with this one, because that looks like the "Twilight Zone" sun.
I still can't find the dessert!!
Always a showboat!
Don't look at me like I'm sushi!
Hey, this is my cartoon cliché — get your own!
Now I drive and you walk.
This doesn't feel like dream to me!
Dammit, man, you almost hit me with that thing!
Do you really think imagination helps?
We both could use a life preserver.
It's red RIGHT return!
You're dreaming.
Chinese hoax you say?
I so too can swim!!
bernie would've won
Oh, No! We can't go on. We've hit water!
This is probably a stupid question, but have you seen water anywhere?
Don't blame me. It's not my fault you can't swim.
Can we synchronize this a little better, please?
Who said you could row all the time?
I'd rather be here than on a sinking boat.
Keep rowing. It's only a hoax.
Keep rowing! I think I see water.
Pass any bars with craft beer?
'Row, row, row your boat,' my ass! Keep it to yourself.
You gave up on your Frontier flight too?
Are you sure this how Hemingway got his inspiration?
I used to like water sports . . . when I was younger . . . back before climare change . . .
If I neglect my core, everything else will unravel.
I don't care that the sand still feels a bit loose. I am telling you right now that this is rock bottom.
Your catch is ok, but you need to work on the release.
A desert island and you choose a boat? Really?
Michael, it's not a hallelujah moment for me!
Can't you play 'anchor' for once?
I fell overboard at the last Mirage!
Hey, I'm walking here!
I swear Patrick, not one more stroke. That was my last left contact...
I still say my needs are more urgent!
I will accept your offer for a lift if you can explain that TRUMP sticker on the transom.
Go back! An orange man is heading to the White House and only knows one hundred forty characters!
I'm not merry, I wish this was a dream, and stop singing that row, row, row your boat song!
Would it help if I threw you a life jacket?
Can we make it to the beach?
WOW! you are one smart captain. Now we cant get shipwrecked again.
Pace me - or I'll never make it to the finish line!
The compass must be somewhere.
Yes, Michael, I know what the song says, but if you sing one more round I'll go it alone.
Stop your whining! When the rowing gets tough, the gruff get going!
I've about had it with suffering.
The ocean called...
That's NOT the way we do things here !
Hey Man, wait up! I've been trying to catch up with you since back at the last mirage!
Hey, this is the oar-free lane!
I'm a just a mirage.
I guess if you own a boat, you don't need water.
Stop being sarcastic and help me find my AirPods.
Sun sand and sea you said! Do you See any sea?
So, what does this prove?
See the difference now between flood and ebb tides?
I am hoping you know more about "Mirages" than I do!
...."But he said it was a Chinese hoax!"
Sir, could you tell me how much farther to the nearest island?
Evangelical, Biblical, “True version” of Row v Wade” getting its just deserts.
You said 'water ho' at least an hour ago!
Still plagued by that 'Row the Boat Ashore' earworm, Michael?
Why am I even pushing the boat?! You didn't even believe in Global Warming!
We can't go on meeting like this.
The Aral Sea", you said! "Let's set the record for swimming across the Aral Sea!
Most people call it the Australian Crawl.
Taking this whole 'post-truth' thing a little far, aren't you?
Did you steal that from the mirage?!?
So much for your technology edge.
I'm having heat stroke, and you're not helping.
I'll signal you from up ahead to start rowing as soon as I see you surrounded by water.
"It's 'gently down the stream.' Not 'sand!'
No Ralph, I said "see if you can find a camel"!
Well, since you were leaving tracks, I knew you were not a mirage.
How much farther to Calais?
My boat started leaking.
Why should I? I going faster than you.
You've made land, so what's your problem?
Stop feathering your oars!
This time when you come with lunch remember I said "No tomato's"
The last eight tenths of a mile is always the toughest.
You're telling me it's still in neutral?
Stop splashing the mirage!
Faster, or our graves will never be dug in time.
Kindly get your rowboat out of my rose garden.
You are not the mirage I expected to see right now.
Do you have any water? I'm a bit parched.
Not even 3-ounce bottles in a Ziploc bag?
Let it glide!
Forgive me sir, your unbridled optimism has been a drag all along.
You forgot the beer and pizza!?
I prefer a Peloton.
I told you we're lost! You're asking for directions at the next oasis.
As my hallucination, you are incorporeal. Therefore it makes absolutely no sense to say there isn't room for both of us in your stupid boat.
You'll never make it.
I drank all the water.
Aren't you out of your milieu?
If you think better equipment will win you the futility award, you're wrong.
When you said we were going to see 'oasis', I thought you meant the band.
My submarine broke down.
Dammit man! There are rules to this.
Geez, okay, you used to be a professional rower. WE GET IT.
You're not fooling anyone.
Not that ship of the desert!
I ordered a mirage over 3 hours ago
I’m afraid the Court will overturn Row.
Serves you right for throwing the coxswain overboard!
Call me a pessimist if you want, but life isn’t “but a dream” no matter how many times you sing it.
I think you've sprung a leak.
We were supposed to switch three dunes ago.
I'd consider being your coxswain...but, a comprehensive health insurance policy is non-negotiable.
I could use that bottle of rum
You're all wet!
Rowed all that way and forgot the life preserver?
If you need help with your canal, I'm your man, I know every inch of this island.
Hey! Stay in your own desert!
I absolutely refuse to sing "just one more round" of "Row, Row, Row Your Boat" .
Are you texting? We should have reached Calais hours ago.
Does this place have a Stairmaster?
Three days of maddening thirst, scorching heat , and a nincompoop singing "row,row,row your boat".
Captain! Captain! Man overboard!!
What in hell's name is your secret?
Got any gum?
You said there wasn't enough room in the lifeboat. But guess what, you weren't too hard to follow!
Row, row, row your boat, my ass. If you hit me in the face one more time with the sand, we're changing places.
I said, 'It's over.'
I still think we should have just taken the river.
I admit you warned me it was going to be slow, but even so, shouldn't we be in China by now??
No one rides for free, huh?
You chose the luxury package.
When I said we could use "a ship of the desert" this is not what I had in mind. . ."
If you'd hurry up, we could get to the oasis faster!
On your mark...Get set...Row!
I am NOT anti-technology, but your silicon footprint is KILLING the desert!
I only wanted a little hug.
Hey, you're disturbing all the fish!
Funny ha ha, "Try the sunstroke."
Hey this is a no passing zone!
"you got the last rental!
I told you not to drink it. Now get back in the boat!
I don't know why I didn't think of that. I'm an excellent swimmer.
You'll die of heat stroke if you keep that up!
Hey, stop edging me off the road.
IF I hear you sing Row, row, row your boat one more time...
Who would think the sea completely loses its liquidity?!
You gonna offer me a ride oar what?
Why did it have to be a desert, island?
Hey, share the desert!
Merrily merrily merrily merrily - my life is but a meme.
I am tired of arguing, but you still enjoy a public row, don't you, Fred?
I told you I don't know how to swim. Hand me the oar already.
So where’s all the press you promised?
Stop sticking your oar in my business!
Oh sure, merrily, merrily row your boat.
And I thought I was in the throws of dementia!
We have to be ready when the big one comes on shore.
Yeah it is one helluva mirage but is it yours or mine?
The argument over global warning continues.
Hey! How about a "playing through"?
I have to come aboard. This place is teeming with land sharks.
Remember, it's my turn when we hit the oasis!
...but I got a great deal on this oceanfront property in Arizona!
I hate to be a tidal bore, but wait six hours. This is the Bay of Fundy after all!
For the last time! Let me row for awhile.
Your afraid I'll slow you down?
Sir all I asked is for you to rate how your service was.
Oh sure...the Messiah can walk on water, but not hot sand.
The only wet spot is where I just wrote my name in the sand.
OK, OK! I admit it's real, so please stop singing that song!
I told you! A wadi is a DRY riverbed.
Didn't you hear me singing hallelujah back at the shore?
Whaddya mean you're looking for dry land?!!!
I'm waiting for a sandstorm
Spare some change?
Welcome to Alaska!
Is there no situation in which you cannot be a hipster?
Please take me to the Oasis mirage.
Last one at the lake is a rotten egg.
Man, I thought I was seeing mirages.
I'm not passive aggressive, like *some people*.
Not a rowboat, you idiot. We need a sandpan to get outta here.
Hitchhikers can be dangerous and Jason didn't want to take that risk.
Need a lift? It looks like we are both going nowhere.
TRY A DIFFERENT MIRAGE
Uber for Sam?
Don't you think your mirage expectations are a bit unrealistic?
Please, Michael...row the boat ashore. Hallelujah!
How many more times - the tide is out!
At least I can see that mirage ahead of us.
Will you relent and abandon ship!
I don't think singing helps, since we don't have a stream and we're not that merry.
Finish your mirage and we'll both feel better!
Hey! This stopped being an hallucination 10 miles ago.
I was wondering the same thing too.
You've been asleep at the wheel again, haven't you?
Are there any other survivers?
Climate change is a bear, isn't it?
Is that a rental?
Last weeks wave knocked me out of my boat.
I've always preferred kayaks.
Cheat!!
Sure, as long as you are willing to row
I think I took a wrong turn...
Quit with the merrilys already!
Hello sailor; would you have a cold glass of juice for a fella?
Can you hear me now?
Got anything stronger than a 15 scented with Bronzer?
It must have been another mirage. Sorry.
I was worried there for a minute, but things are looking great again.
Optimists always win.
Can I bum a ride my SUV ran out of gas a few miles back.
When are you going to realize this is a mirage?
Can we try another tune?
Very funny, a-hole.
Hey...fuck you Fred!
You got to row all the way from Death Valley...it's my turn now!
Merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream!
Careful, you're disturbing the fish.
Pretty sure this is NOT the Arabian Sea.
This is one hell of an ending to the audacity of hope!
You can't always get what you want.
I pictured myself in a boat on a river, a river dang it!
How's about stopping at the pedestrian crosswalk?
Theoretically this should be a cause for celebration...
This is the worst first date ever.
My turn to row. Your turn to troll for sand sharks.
Hey coach, when can I switch from the crawl to the back stroke?
Someday son. This will all be yours.
No worries! It is just a mirage
I don't feel safe anymore.
Told you my workout was tougher.
I believe we're looking for the same thing, water!
Save water now so we don't look like this in the future.
It's your turn to play the alligator Mr. "Fake It Til You Make It!"
You proved your point, now pass me my roller skates.
I think this Global Warming thing might be for real after all!
All this time, you thought we were in a soft drink commercial?
I just need the wind to pickup.
Why can't you remember where you found it?
This is not the way to the sea - I told you to ask for directions!
Seems like this is where we started.
I just don't understand why He'd send a rowboat.
I "dig" what you are doing, but where's the WATER?
I don't know about you, but for me these 'guys in the desert' and 'guys stranded on a desert island' cartoons are getting old.
A lesser known part of the Bible - he begins by crawling.
Not one more word about rowing being a better full-body workout, Josh.
'Join a gym buddy."
When's it my turn to row?!!
Connor and his conscience have another heated row.
Damn you, Fred, you're beating me even in my own dream
Could you spare a bit of sun blocker?
Pretty rude to imply water at a time like this...
No thanks. Only carbonated water for me.
I never thought global warming would come to this.
"Row, row, row your boat!" Let's hope it's "but a dream".
Can you throw me a life jacket already !
Dammit, man, you almost hit me with that thing!
excuse me sir, but you are on my tanning spot
C'mon! It's my turn to row!
It's a fake news hoax! Don't fall for that "life is but a dream" story!
If you had got here on time, this would have still been an island.
Life is but a mirage.
Get your act together, Noah.
I was told not to swim against the current
Hey, sir! How would you like an opportunity to make seven figures a year without leaving the house?
I can row, even if you are a mirage.
That's not what I meant by ship of the desert.
If you want a ride, you have to row!
I'll trade you dry land for some water.
So this is your ship of the desert?
Spelling matters. This is a desert, not a dessert.
Hooper ya idiot. Starbord!
Could you tell me if the Dow has hit 20,000 yet?
If I hear you sing "row, row, row your boat" one more time, I'm gonna kill you!
Will you slow down! You're stirring up the jelly fish!
It is sand.
Couldn't Moses have waited until I finished the race?
Nearest toilet. About 2,200 miles. You can't miss it.
You can't be right. My GPS says we're in the middle of Lake Minihaha.
No, dagnabbit, I don't know how far it is to shore.
If you really want to know how I got here I'll tell you; I swam.
"No such thing as Global Warming", he says. "2020 is a perfect year to swim across Lake Erie.", he says.
In light of global warming, I am keeping in shape for the flood.
I'm not cheating; you're cheating.
And I thought I was in bad shape.
this is the Sahara not the South sea ,sir
Whaddya mean, 'I sent my camel to bed'?
Get off my lawn!
Use some common sense, boating season doesn't start until next month!
Well now you've got us up the creek WITH two paddles.
Can I join your mirage?
Now, you tell me upgrades are free with the Sapphire Card!
I wouldn't recommend the breast stroke or freestyle either.
No, I'm not bailing you out of this one.
Is this the line for the HOV carpool?
OK, you win...there are no fish anywhere over here!
Forget about it, I''m not falling for your fake news this time!
This is where irrational exhuberance leads!
So who's hallucinating here?
What's this? No life preserver in your mirage?
any water?
For the thousandth time, Lou. You're in DENIAL!
Thanks, Obama!
My advice...don't stop to think.
Don't you think you are taking this whole mirage thing a little too far??
A bit optimistic about finding water aren't you??
Don't stop now. I'm telling you, the climatologists are wrong. The Pacific Ocean is just over the next ridge.
I'm going to pass you. I told you to get an outboard motor.
Did you mail my letter?
I'm preparing for the big flood, it's going to happen anytime now.
Climate change Da Nile, eh?
Okay, I'll keep swimming alongside, but only if you stop shouting land ahoy.
I told you to be careful what you wish for!
You're screwing with my self-esteem, right?
The fact that I can’t swim is hard evidence that you are the mirage, not me.
This isn't an either oar situation—disagreeing in a post-fact world is no reason for us to row.
Don't worry, you said. I have GPS in my head, you said!
I only need a cup, you need a flood.
Could you give me a lift to Hawaii? My timeshare is starting on Monday.
How long have you been lost?
Have a good day!
All I know is that we won't get to the ocean any sooner by NOT rowing
Beats "pounding" the sand.
Hey, fella, how's that working for ya?
Take it easy...this is MY mirage!
Lazy.
Honeymoon adventure, he tells me. " "It will be fun." "First team to row around the entire planet, he says.
I'm sorry, I only have bitcoin...
Hey! When is it going to be my turn to row?
Still think climate change is but a dream?!
I know I know… Life is but a dream!
You're in my lane.
Hey, watch it, you're getting sand in my face!
You're crazy if you think I'm going to let you row around in my oasis.
Hey, you said you didn't have a boat!
Just try me, I rowed crew in college.
Wait till you see MY boat.
You see, I've been through the desert in a boat with no name, it felt good to be out of the the rain. Oh, hello there, can you tell me how far to Marrakech?
Life is NOT but a mirage!
Cheat!!
You on surge pricing?
Can you spare an oar for a man who's down on his luck?
I don't think YOU understand what a sandstorm is.
Quit rowing our tour guide. It's just a mirage à trois.
That's just great, now you've got me humming Row, Row, Row Your Boat.
The ad said "Sun and See Sand" not "Sun, Sea and Sand."
Having any luck?
Excuse me sir, but do you have any water? I've been stranded for days and...wait a minute...did you get that shirt at Macy's?
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily...can I stop singing now?
You probably think that's funny.
Yes, I do feel less foolish for believing this was not a mirage.
Why do you have to be such an idealist?
This sand is even saltier than the water was. Keep rowing.
If you're not going all the way to Sacramento, I don't want to ride with you.
I'm waiting for the self-driving model to come out.
Oars! Oars! My kingdom for your oars!
You were right. This isn't a stream.
I said, "59th and Lex, PLEASE!"
"Don't bother, it's just a mirage".
Don't tell me, "Not a grain to sink?"
I'm gonna crawl past you on this next dune.
Why are you having all the fun?
I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
I told you when we lost the motor this would be trouble.
Ahoy! Have you seen the white whale?
Please don't leave me !
Can you please stop with the 'sunfish jokes'?
You're still saying this is a hoax by the Chinese?
You brought tap! Row back and get the Fiji!
I've never seen such optimism!
I hate to admit it, but we sold our waterfront property too soon.
You're gonna need a bigger oasis.
"Icarus"!
Climate Change came early.
Your holier than thou attitude will get you nowhere fast.
I told you you should feather the oars!
What's your rush Ahab. Moby doesn't play in this sandbox.
Maybe it's a dream, but it's my dream, dammit.
Hey pal, could you put me in the direction of the nearest mirage.
Is it easier now?
Sorry, only UberBOAT available at the moment...
Fares’ fare—it’s my turn in the boat.
You might as well turn around now; it's only for drinking and camels.
Pal, this isn't the red sea.
Joey we aren't in Kansas anymore.
Where in Hell have you been?
Yea, climate change is DEFINITELY a conspiracy invented by the Chinese.
You've got to learn to crawl before you can row!
What are you doing?!?" --- "Winning.
As a coxswain, he was considered a better motivator than navigator.
Again, it's not a mirage.
Can you text me if you find some water?
Concentrate on your stroke, you keep missing water!
So this guy comes into a bar....
Not a drop to drink?!!
Nor any drop to drink here either.
Don't be so dramatic, the tour group is just over there.
Aren't you supposed to be a mermaid?
You can run, crawl, or row, but you cannot escape yourself.
What's the worst that could happen?
A glass of water would have improved my mood.
It may be everywhere, but it's sand.
Sure, it's more efficient. But you won't feel as satisfied.
Merrily, life is but a dream.
Aerobically speaking which one of us is burning more calories?
They're draining the swamp -get aboard!
I don't care if you were on Harvard crew! Enough is enough!
You row till the next mirage.
Who was the guy who told us that crossing the Red Sea would be a cinch?
Please! I need a ride
Bob, not funny.
Stop saying 'We're not there yet' every time we pass a steer skull!
"Would you please row your ass and that boat outta this lost-in-the-desert cartoon?
Enough! Life is but a nightmare right now and you are not helping.
You'll find a mirage at the bottom of the hill.
Listen, life ain't but a dream.
Darn it! I told you "the crawl" is a swim stroke!
Are you coming from the lake? - or going towards it?
You fool! Did you not see the size of that mop?!
Where in God's name did you find that boat?
This whole thing has gone far enough now.
Outsmarting climate change doesn't mean you've disproved it.
Fool, burning calories for nought. FitBit's never going to catch those strokes.
Slow Down! You're stirring up too much wake!
What time does the caravan meet us?
Do you have any idea what time the Southbound boat will be coming through?
You promised me a turn rowing at sunrise! You never let me have any fun...
I'm drowning! Throw me a life jacket!
Froster, why in the hell are you rowing a road that hasn't been travelled?
This is worse than a mirage
It doesn't matter. Keep rowing!
Where's the EPA when you really need it?
No, this is Congressional Ethics. Constitutional Ethics is down there, next to the cliffs.
I don't care if Bogart towed the African Queen. The Nazi gunboat is probably gone by now.
Desert upward dog, dude!
So we're going this way because the dolphins told us to?
Gently down the stream, Ted--the stream!
And you said he could never win.
Where?? You're between the devil and the deep blue sea.
YOU CAN MAKE IT––with a bailer.
More right rudder.
No! I ordered half pepperoni and half MUSHROOM !
Dont you think we should have seen a sign by now?
It was only a matter of time before desertification spread to the oceans.
Hey, Uber driver. Can you hear me now?
You're an idiot.
Blow right past me! I see how you oar.
Desert boat yoga is all the rage!
Wow, you're not giving up on that mirage, are you?
Can you drink the water?
Global warming is a Chinese hoax.
With better form you'd be at the mountains by now.....
So now, are you finally convinced, that Water Is Life?
Michael...Hallelujah!
"Have we caught any po'kemons yet"?
This wasn't my idea of my ship coming in, but for now it will do.
Yeah, me too ... I expected global warming, but not this quickly!
I give up. I can't sing 'Row, row, row your boot' any more.
Forget it! I TOLD you that tsunami warning ended ages ago!
Tired of Row, Row, Row Your Boat? How about a Hundred Bottles of Beer on the Wall?
You said you needed a navigator.
So this is your "ship of the desert". Mine is a camel.
You don't even know where you're rowing!
Is the tide rising or falling?
yep, safe to to get out, we've definitely run out of sea...
Stop Jack! If we return to the village now, maybe we can get our cow back.
Please tell me it's not a land shark!
Last one in is a rotten egg.
That mirage was five miles ago.
I left my wallet on the ship.
I asked for UberCamel, dammit!
The glass is half empty.
Don't you DARE ask me "What's in your wallet?" one more time.
Just give it a minute, we've reached the Bay Of Fundy.
I guess he really was a doctor...
Merrily ,merrily merrily, merrily life is but a mirage.
Well, if it wasn't made of concrete, maybe it would actually be of some use to us.
Always lording your "positivity mindset" hokum over everybody, aren't you, Boggins?
Let me guess, you're an ultra-marathoner?
Hey, where's your life preserver?
I, your loyal desert coxswain who called out your rowing tempo for 20 days and nights, am now tossed overboard as a reward?
It may be a yacht in the Caribbean to you, but in my mirage this is a Tidy Bowl commercial.
Drydock? What drydock?
If you row it, it will come.
Please mention my situation to Him the next time you go complaining about the size of you ark.
If you'd feather your oars you wouldn't have hit me on the head!
I admire your concern for the environment. and your avoidance of fossil based fuels as a means of propulsion.
Did you buy your map from the president elect too....??
You could at least throw me a life saver jacket!
OK, but this is MY mirage; you have to get your own.
We both need water!
And you're wearing sunblock as well I presume?
You must bring into the ark all two living creatures.
Thanks for your concern but I prayed and God is going to rescue me.
The optimism is starting to get on my nerves, Jeff.
Let me know if you spot an optometrist.
Didn't you see the stop sign?
C'mon, sing. Row, row, row your boat...
I told you we should have splurged for the extra oars.
Thanks goodness! Please help me, I want to get out of this island.
Enough lifeboats, you said! Chinese hoax, you said!
Maybe you should have reminded me of global warming BEFORE paying for the boat
Alt-starboard!
Cry me a river....cry me a river, I'll cry a river over you
Okay, it's my turn in the boat. You get to sing Row, Row, Row Your Boat now.
I might be skating on thin ice here, but I totally think we overshot the coast!
I think we're both mirages.
Sure hope God sends you a helicopter next.
They mean camels, you fool!
It's a long road to Tipperary!
The one time when Michael rowed his boat ashore with no hallelujah.
'Man overboard' doesn't work like that out here.
Do you mind? You're making my saga look ridiculous.
It's my turn to row!
Pardon me, is that the new Prius?
I say, Lawrence. You are a clown!
There's plenty of room!
At least the taxes are low and it isn't raining!
The right answer must have been 'C' Camel!
Maybe it's climate change.
No, my name is not Wilson!
I can get off at the next stop.
Alright, best two out of three.
Wait for it, the plague of locusts is on its way!
Hast seen the white whale?
did you bring sunscreen ?
The app says you were to be 10 minutes ago
Watch what you are doing! You are getting sand on top of me!
Keep rowing pal. Everyone knows surge pricing is a racket.
Look, man - I think the time for change has come. You're in a rut.
...and in the winter I bet you tear up the snow with a #$&* snowmobile!
Best Uber ever!
Hey, watch what you're doing with that oar!
You heard the Captain! "Women and children first!"
I don't care if it keeps your mind occupied. There is no stream and this is a total nightmare so STOP singing!
But I'm tired of pretending to be a land shark.
Sand, sand everywhere and not a drop to drink.
I think we made a wrong turn.
I think you overshot the shore by a little bit.
Do you ever get the feeling the chickens are watching us?
Enough already with that damn 'Row, Row, Row, My Boat' of yours.
Are you sure we're on the list?
You can't believe it's a good thing to be left high and dry!
...You're not Wilson.
How about giving a rest to your "merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream"?
Either you have to stop rowing or I have to get up on my feet and walk. Pick one. PLEASE!!!
I bet you'll remember your water next time Phil.
Hey, dude, can you give me directions to the ocean? I'm a little lost!
I think we'll need a bigger oasis.
I'll die of thirst before I come onboard the HMS Sand For Brains!!
I'm not worried about drowning in a flash flood.
But we're tired, we're poor!
At least you're a metaphor.
It'll work I tell you;just keep rowing!
For the last time, I'm Herb Meriwether not Sancho Panza!
I guess swimming wasn't the answer.
'A vacation on the lake would have been more fun.'
Why don't you just admit it. When our species first came ashore they must have evolved.
Okay, I'll stop singing, "Row, row, row your boat gently on the sand."
What the heck are you doing on my land!
You're humming the "things go better with Coke" song again.
Like I said, you really needed a coxswain.
I've told you that you splash me with every stroke. STOP IT, oar else!
The last good time in town.
I TOLD you Trump Links was sub par!
I *still* say it's a Chinese hoax, libtard!
You overestimated Trump's effect on rising sea levels.
Turn right at the next light.
Ok. Pretend water, then. Please!
And this is why rowing is not a popular sport in Juan de Fuca.
Does mirage mean anything to you?
For the last time, no I did not take a boating safety course.
And here people said you couldn't do anything practical with solar energy.
You'll never get away with this!
Get outta my way!
this would make a great song in the 80's
Your dolphin impression needs work, I'm still believing in climate change.
Wouldn't it just be easier to wait for the full effect global warming?
I think this story is going to need jazzing up Mr.Columbus.
I told you we needed a water softener!
I think you zigged when you should have zagged.
It's been weeks...I'm begging you...please tell me...why are actresses now called 'actors'?
Son, I told you to be home before midnight! You're grounded!
We flipped an coin and you lost. I'm in the boat, and you swim.
It's also better to starve for an entire week than to eat when there is no food.
... But I always knew I wouldn't drown.
Can I use the restroom on your yacht?
I was thinking a waterfall and palm trees--not even close.
No, I said you should go VOTE.
When you said "I smell water" I didn't realize your sense of smell was that sensitive.
Hey, it's my turn to try out the rowing machine.
Mind if I float?
Mine was solar powered.
I told you we made a wrong turn at Albuquerque.
Do you know which way to the dock ?
It was never the sailor's life for me....
Hey Buddy, are you getting any bites in this area?
OK but the LAKE was an illusion...
Row faster!
Can I join you on your non moving thing?
Well, I just call it wishful thinking.
Enough with your fantasies.
Swimming only in this mirage!
So strange are the ways of paradox...
Let me in and turn the boat around, or sing "Row, row, row your boat" by your damn self.
and Mexico will pay for it.
throw me a walker
Did you read that book about the 1936 rowing team?
Roe v. Crawl is NOT an important Supreme Court decision.
I warned you not to eat the week-old apricots at the oasis.
Do you think if I dig down far enough we can find water?
Can you row me to my water mirage?
Hey! Hey! Poignancy's all I got.
Water, Ho.
No, you didn't mention Telemundo before. 'English Channel. Spanish channel. What's the difference?!'
Think I can't do it? Watch this!
Fine! I'll endorse your Denial skill on LinkedIn.
I thought you said it was a mirage.
One of us must be seeing a mirage
No charge! I can steer you to the next oasis.
This is what happens if you won't stop clinging to outmoded technology!
Pay up, you've hit atoll!
I get it! Been there done that!
I'm going back to the Iron Man Triathlon!
Have you seen a brown tabby running by?
You were right, it's much faster by boat
Mirage-shmirage. Your wake's impeding my progress.
No way. No more singing rounds until I get to row.
I prayed for a moat - not a boat!
Yeah.. I guess you could say it's shorter this way.
This is so unfair !!!
Save a drowning man
I'm beginning to think "amber waves of grain" was a metaphor.
Easy on starboard!
No, I do NOT want to sand ski.
Sorry Bud, you forgot to say "MAY I"
Please, please let me climb aboard!! I'm not a strong swimmer... but I rowed stroke in the college eight!!
I'm telling you its a mirage!
I'm beginning to think she's not really a Pilates instructor.
I'm looking for the line between scepticism and denial.
I said "It's Global Warming! Can you hear me now?…"
Help! Help! I'm sinking!
Climate change!
I'm no genius,but your rowing seems counter productive.
Ocean! Need ocean!
Did no one tell you when you reached shore to stop rowing?
Another false start for the optimist.
Frank, we have this whole ocean to share and somehow you can't stop hitting me with your oar while I'm swimming?! Seriously Frank! The whole ocean....
Where'd you put the damn fly rod? I'm hungry.
Just wait. I haven't done a down dog in weeks.
Are you going to be able to break a fifty dollar bill?
If you are not a mirage, then you must be crazy.
What, you're looking for Al Gore now?
Surely it must be my turn to row now?
STOP ROWING YOUR BOAT. YOU'RE HALLUCINATING.
Sorry, a rising tide does NOT float your boat in the Sahara.
That's what I've been saying!
You wanted a "ship of the desert" not a boat for the desert!
Wait up--Damn it!!
Wait for me! I can't keep up!
Life was tough before the invention of the wheel.
Water, where's the water; you idiot that's my line
You get more traction with the dog paddle.
I'm tired of singing "Row-row-row your boat".
Row row row your boat. Gently down the dune. Merrily merrily merrily. That guy on his knees looks like a goon
I see we have differing positions on Row v. Crawl.
I'm convinced it's time to rethink this desert isle strategy.
I can see you're NOT going my way.
Obviously, we are not in the came boat.
How far is it back to water?
At least you have water.
I joined the yatch club but the dues were too high.
Hey Buddy! This is the all fours lane.
No, this is NOT an 'Amazing Race'!
You may have been right about paying that docking fee.
For the last time, I'm not gonna sing Row Row Row Your Boat.
What do you mean there's no room in the baot?
Help! I can't swim. And I'm not so good at crawling either.
This is my second lap. I will be back in about 2 years, then you can jump in.
Going from or to the water?
Just like political corruption the sand is everywhere.
Sir, with all due respect, especially in the face of climate change, may I suggest that you consider a different event for the opcomcoming Olympics?
Noah! You need a bigger boat!
Bad news Danny, we hit a sandbar in a dry county.
It's a long way to tippararee, it is a long way to go
There's a tidal wave coming!!
Fire your 'Land Ho' guy.
Are you sure Donald Trump really won?
Summer Olympics 2052: Gold medal winners for swimming and rowing.
Careful 'bout the sunstroke, son.
Woof Woof, Arf Arf. Now can we trade?
The mirage is a kilometer back"
I'm taking this up with Uber.
But, her e-mails...
Find your beach yet?
I SAID second verse! Row, row, row your boat gently up the STREAM!
One if by land, Two if by sea
Nope. Still no water.
No, I certainly will not sing 'Row, row, row your boat' for you!
You mean to tell me this is not an Olympic sport?
What do you mean we are better off on this deserted island?
...some guy called Moses - apparently its not the first time either... trust me Frank I'll be writing a strongly worded email on Monday.
Hey, quit splashing me with that oar!
No, no Uber. I said I'm up the creek -- send a Jeep.
Just because Jesus could walk on water doesn't mean you can canoe through land. You're not Jesus, Mike.
That wasn't in my Deserts for Dummies.
But you taught me to fish!
Is that you, Jonah?
We will have water soon after January 20th.
Sorry, Pussy's on the next boat
It's rough out here.
They call this a vacation?
Did you hear me say "oars"? I said "horse" for chrissake.
I'm pleading with you Jack, don't row any further...the tide ain't coming back to this place and Global Warming is real.
Are you thirsty?
No, the Australian Crawl will not be faster!
Water water no where, and nary a drop to drink." "Huh. I was thinking 'O water, water - wherefore art thou water?' But if you prefer Coleridge over the Bard ...
"Going back to Cuba! Castro's dead, and Trump 'It's ALIVE'!
Sorry, it's too warm to shiver my timbers.
Let's give the old Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily life is but a dream another go!
I did pay my carbon tax.
Throw me a lifeline, buddy!
You'll never find the oasis going that direction
HELP! Throw me a life vest, I cant swim!
Rock, paper, scissors?
Got port?
Have you no shame?
And you took the sun block too!
Well, at least it is smooth sailing.
And the winner is....
Help me! I've got sand in my suit.
Dude in a dingy in the dirt, sing me a ditty.
You have no idea how happy my wife is I found you.
I didn't know this is what you had in mind when you told me to walk the plank!
Life's a real beach.
Idiot! You'll get nowhere without me helping you row!
I think I'll skip the "low-impact travel" package next time.
Still sticking to that global warming survival strategy of yours, eh Greg?
Noah, why couldn't you wait for the flood?
I said hard on starboard!
Oh, its just like you to row all this way to mess up my mirage!
Like I told you before - you do 1 hour and I do 1 hour.
And they said we were running out of oil...
I'm thinking the Hare and Tortoise story doesn't work for either of us.
Hey, you're hogging the boat. It's my turn to row.
Hello Noah. My name's Sandy.
hey bro
No, it couldn't have been global warming!
Noah, the waters receded some 5000 years ago!
Are you the Tortoise or the Hare?
Row row row your boat ... Ok, now you start... (gently down the...) Row row row your boat...
One day, you'll thank me for this.
I am done with letting God steer.
I think we have to admit to ourselves that rowboating just isn't the same in a post-climate change world.
I was here first!
WE SHOULD HAVE WAITED UNTIL AFTER THE DROUGHT TO PROTEST ROE V WADE
Yeah.....over a million years ago...
You'd make better headway with a good cox.
I wish you would stop calling me a landlubber!
Hey, Doofus: "Row, row, row your boat...."
It can't ALL be a mirage!
When you said "climate," you should have been more specific.
As a matter of fact, this is water and I'm crawling on it.
I can't wait for tourist season to be over.
Let's switch places, your rowing technique is driving me crazy.
Are we ashore or at sea?
You are on the sand idiot.
Hey! Can't you see you're in a no wake zone?
You're not going to stop and give me a lift?
This mirage crap of yours is really getting old.
Careful. If you touch the boat, you're disqualified.
"- - - -to me, weigh, hey, blow the man down." Now it's your turn to sing. I'll row.
Actually, this IS my first rodeo.
Whadda-ya mean the water bottle is empty?
It's a start but my mirage needs some water in it!
Excuse me, but this is a no passing lane.
Sahara sand, dude, sans beach; it's your singing "row, row, row your boat" without the merrily that's reduced me to a crawl.
Can't you just admit that voting for Nader was a mistake?
Who said this was a dry town
Ok. I've seen the sun set. We can go home now.
It's called the sunstroke paddle.
I thought *I* was your dreamboat!
Sans Sea.
I don't think this route across the channel will catch that current you recommended.
You rowed us off course again!
I suppose tapping sadistic irony for the will to live must feel pretty dandy.
No fair! It's my turn now!
I hope this doesn't hurt your feelings but I think crawling is easier than rowing.
I told you it was just a mirage!
Let's make America great again
I know what he knew. Boy what a genius. Drain the swamp with nukes.
This Carnival Cruise is absolutely NOTHING like I was promised by my Travel Agent.
When are you going to get that it's a mirage?
I'm telling mom you didn' wear a life preserver.
There's no boating allowed in any.of the mirages here.
Toss me the buoy.
See I told you the sand is hot on this side of the desert too!
I'm sorry. I only ride in taxis.
If I can't pretend it's water than neither can you
I feel like we've done this before.
Hey dummy, you rowed right into the triathlon course!
Are you sure we weren't supposed to turn left at the road?
Hey Tim, can I ride your pig?
We're going to need a better boat.
I'm Wade, and you're not out of the desert by a long shot.
You're such a tease!
Go back. There are a bunch of those crazy climate change alarmists back there.
You're not a mirage?!
But damn-it if we didn't stand up to China
I'm not buying into all of that beach body hype
Are you trying to confuse me?
Hey buddy, can you spare a lift preserver?
Stop means stop!
Life is but a dream, Robert, but you've got to remember to stay in the stream.
Come on Sandy,let me back in. I do like your singing.
That report on the quicker warming of our oceans was way off!
Damn- I forgot my flotation device!
No more rum for you at the next sand bar.
Where were you when I needed you?
When I proposed a real-world legislative model, I didn't think we'd have to demonstrate.
Can you give me a lift? I sprung a leak back a few miles.
My crawl beats your breast stroke any day.
Are you sure you drop the anchor on this side ?
I'll show you how to wish. Give me the monkey's paw!
Are you thirsty?
Seems you got heat stroke, mister.
You tried this rescue last year. It didn't work.
what do you mean, you want to talk to your union's representative?
Hey, watch where you're going! It's bad enough that I'm hallucinating you, but you just about hit me with your oar.
So now it's just a cliche wrapped in a trope wrapped in a mockery.
No thanks, I want someone who's not a career rower.
Watch where you are rowing. I'm doing the American crawl over here.
An ocean of sand is not made from water.
Stop! It's all mirage, in the non-Vegas sense.
You're floating on a mirage, you idiot.
No thanks, I'm not got that way.
Now THAT'S how you play Twister.
So I have reached Economy Cruise Line.
Are you sure this is the Mediterranean sea?
I don't know how to tell you this, but we've run out of beach. The ocean's the other way!
Duh,it's not,"rowed through the desert."
O.K. you're here....now do we pray for rain or a pole shift?
Could you spare a sandwich?
I can't help that I have weak forearms.
Where's your turn signal buddy?
I'm in California?!
I don't need your upbeat evaluation.
Well I'd define it as a lifeboat because I'm dying.
I told you to turn left on 34th Street, not right.
Dumb ass doppelgänger. I asked for a dune-buggy, not a row boat!
HOW ABOUT A LIFT ?
This is a swimming bay - didn't you see the buoys?!
There's no point in beating on, boat against the sand, borne back ceaselessly into nowhere. You'll die anyways.
Drain the swamp! Now what? And of quo "Drained the swamp! Now what?
Well, for one thing, I can warn you of any icebergs!
San Bernadino?
Check your privilege, buddy.
I know two captains can't be in one boat, but could I just have a ride?
Is my pursuit of water too mundane?
I'm sorry just because your name is Noah doesn't mean that God is going to do a miracle and put water here in the Desert
Remember when we wanted to be a Navy SEAL?
No. I said, if I could have anything right now it would be a sandwich.
What is the difference between a desert and a deserted island?
Please don't splash me!
All day we've faced the barren waste without a taste of pure, clear water!
The waves are really breaking over near the oasis.
Don't be cocky. You don't have any better chance than I do!
I'm quitting. You know very well this isn't the way a crew team really operates.
This end of the mirage is closed to watercraft.
So don't give me a ride. You got any idea how much a carpool lane ticket will set you back?
Fancy meeting you here!
I tell you I am not rowing one more grain until you admit we voted incorrectly!
This is a mirage, right.
OK...this role playing game has gotten way out of hand
Hey Noah, get lost.
You still don't look like Charlton Heston in Ben Hur.
Nova Scotia, Pop?
Heat prostration is much worse! At least with heat stroke you get a boat and a pair of oars!
Can you tell me what time it is?
Still hoping for another biblical flood Noah-dude?
The tide already came and went!
Hey! Watch it!
Why do they always have to flip the script on us?
How much further is the beach?
So where's this oasis you speak about?
No, no, no. We need to go the OTHER way!
Even when I have a sun stroke you have to one up me, huh?
Can you throw me a life preserver there matey!
Hey Throw me a life jacket will you!
For the love of all that's holy, "The Secret" doesn't work!
Ok I give up. What's just around the next inlet?
So Mr "Who Once Owned a Boat!" How's that experience working for you NOW!
I told you to turn the oven off.
I think it's my turn to row now while you search for the Giant Squid.
Keep rowing, we'll have a canal soon.
I know...right!
I don't care what you tweet, Mr. Trump. This is not Lake Erie!
Global warming has nothing to do with this.
At least there's no sharks.
Is this why all the kids are saying "it's lit?"
No, you did not catch a crab!
So how's this going to make America great again?
We would have been better off leaving the boat behind and just kept waiting on the dock of the bay.
For the last time, this is NOT the way to train for the Olympic Rowing team.
You gotta fake it to make it.
It’s excellent except for leaking sometimes.
What? Have you seen the hot yoga membership costs?
HEY, I was here first, Get you own mirage!
Jeez, how long does it usually take for you to give up on a mirage?
You didn't see the pedestrians only sign on this mirage?
Thar she blows!
Quick! I need to buy a bark collar!
I see you row, row, rowing, but where is the stream?
Hey! I'm crawlin' heah, I'm crawlin' heah!
Tell me again why we are on the row more travailed.
I'm gonna soak up the sun.
Now you'll get more "Likes"!
Sand, sand everywhere and still no oasis yet.
...If it's yellow, let it mellow. But not YOU! You just HAD to flush every time.
This is the longest beach on earth!
I'll let them know you want to be buried in the boat.
How long have YOU been digging?
Either way, it's easier than going through TSA, though my agent tried to get me into the easier Cartoon #551.
Easy up! If you don't bury your blades, you'll never get anywhere!
Go on yerself, mate! Bergs always appear when ya least expect 'em!
Your Pollyanna-ish optimism is really getting on my nerves.
I've had it with your practicing, "The Secret"!
Sorry, I said "I need some water", not "I see the water"
Hey, Buddy, you got the time?
Slower traffic, stay left!
How come I have to be the volleyball?!
I wonder if that's more comfortable.
How did we end up here?
Give me a ride if I tell you alternative lyrics to "Row, Row, Row Your Boat"??
ACID STORIES: "We are sitting in your basement, right?"
I was just about to build a castle you can build the mote.
I never said I was a great coxswain
A proactive approach to global warming
Is it true that the water is really the same on both sides of the boat?
In my next mirage you're going to be gender re-assigned
If you see a crocodile, don't forget to smile!"
Why do I always have to be the one on foot?
If Harry shows, we will have a perfect round for "Row, Row, Row Your Boat."
I could have taken that boat, but going backwards makes me dizzy.
Down the sream, Benny, down the stream.
You better not be heading towards my mirage!
I told you we have have rented the GPS unit!
I wish it all were a mirage.
Apparently you missed the boathouse by taking the wrong turn at the fork about ten miles back.
Ah, Come on!
keep going. you're making me very thirsty.
I am not paying surge prices.
I'm looking for Noah.
Does the tale of the Tortoise and the Hare give you a clue?
Count to 5,000 this time and then see if it's still there.
Can't swim like the rest of us?
After this we better have a good answer to ¨what was your most challenging situation¨
Mechanical advantage!?
I wish I could be more help, but I know these parts better than most, and I can assure you, sir, there is NO Ship Creek.
I said, ICED Latte!
Wait for rain then row to a town to get water.
Goin' fishin'?
My heatstroke is more powerful than yours!
I am NOT your white whale!
Just wait till we hit water!
Sand and sand-wiches everywhere. And not a bit to eat!
I'll take turns rowing, if you give me a glass of water.
These theme park attractions are getting too realistic.
You went wrong at Casablnca
You're inside, I'm outside, nothing changes.
Hmmmm. I vote we turn around . Cuba 's not looking so bad.
I said in my email, I wanted to be dropped off for DESSERT.
Got any jelly donuts?
C'mon, it's your turn to push!
Fine, but next time I'm calling Lyft.
Always look on the bright side of life, bud...
No, I'm not a mirage!
I know you're doing the Crossfit Trials, but this is ridiculous.
Seriously? You surreal estate agent?
Now I know why mom said "Be carful."
Hey watch out, there's a river coming up!
I'm nuts? Stop splashing me with the oars!
"Perhaps you misunderstood when I said :It would be nice to have something "like" water.
So, Noah, what do you have to say now?
When I want a comedian, I'll let you know.
If Trump wants to thank Snowden for all his help why doesn't he just ask Putin where he is?
What do you mean you only take quarters?
Definitely my last polar bear swim.
I think we were supposed to turn 3 dunes ago.
Is the boat rental by the hour?
Leave the Sat Nav at home, he says, It'll be more fun this way, he says! Grrr!
How about a tow?
Aren't you overstepping your authority? We're not at sea anymore.
In a race your heatstoke will beat mine every time.
Oh, for Pete's sake!
Paradoxical intervention?
Your lost?
Hey, slow down! The vultures can't keep up!
Yes, time is relative. Suffering is relative, too. But sandbars? Sandbars are not relative.
Sorry, I didn't mean "go pound sand" literally!
Jim, you're hallucinating again!
I believe in an all-of-the-above energy solution.
You and Your "Leave Footprints on the sands of time"; I've left mine over the last 10 miles and when is it YOUR turn?
By chance, did you run across any water when you were over there?
It's all because of you climate change crazies. Say something enough times, it comes true.
Water, water, everywhere?
You know, this is just plain cheating!
Just call me Sancho Panza.
Did you say your name is Noah?
Which math genius thought up this story problem?
That's a tough row to hoe or row!
C'mon Jerry, it's just s rash.
Time to deregulate the water industry.
Get out and swim ahead? Can't you see I forgot my swimming trunks?
Fred, having to listen to your sarcasm is anything but a dream.
Operation Desert Storm has gone on long enough.
Your insistence on singing 'Merrily, merrily, merrily' is worse than the dehydration itself.
Can I please get a ride to the mountain?
Aren't those bananas?
Tell my wife I love her.
You got the basic economy fare too?
DAMN – I tossed my water skis hours ago.
So, that's what happens when you turn that upside down.
Nice dinghy, dingy!
And I say the fact that my camel died does NOT prove the boat is safer. That shark attack was one-in-a-million!
For the last time... enough with the ocean route!
What an odd looking fish!
Lets re-imagine that as a Range Rover for a minute.
Don't worry! FiveThirtyEight says it won't hit us!
The Nile river is coming in about a mile. You might have more luck there.
Get your damn slow boat out of the fast lane!
If I'd known there was no water on this planet, I wouldn't have come. What about you?
It's not Michael rowed the boat on shore, you idiot. I'll let you know when I'm finished so you can cover it with sand.
The answer is still NO.
Wow I guess global warming might be real.
Good thing you brought a sandbreaker, Burt
You mean to say that when you saw the ad for Survivor-Dessert Wars, you didn't think it might've been a typo?
I don't know Harry, why does it seem like you're going faster?
Michael, enough! Hallelujah
You had to buy the cheap one.
I sense something's wrong
Watch where you are going! Trying to have a leisurely swim here.
You took the wrong turn too, eh?
Stop. We've made it down the stream.
It's my turn to drive the damn boat!
I don't think my holiday weight is the problem.
Nice job Noah. I told you He'd never believe this was an ark.
How they bitten?
Get back in the boat? are you crazy brother? Channel 12 says nothing but clear skys ahead
Yes, it's just ahead.
I don't care how chilly and cold it is ... get the hell back in the water, Michael!
Our mirages seemed to cancel eachother out.
So, Frank, how do you like your Chinese hoax now?
Hey, I told you I needed a ride
So sorry.You've sprung a leak and its each man for himself!
We need to get on the same page on two levels. Start rowing or start crawling in the same direction.
No, I will not sing along to row, row, row your boat.
I'm washed up!
Networking at burning man has just never be the same after the Trump presidency.
Make a mirage out of me, it will last longer.
I don't want to say I told you, but yes, a mirage!
I'm crawling on water?!
A sail boat might be a better choice.
You can row but you cannot glide!
Stay out of my water!
Water--overrated!
It's time for some game theory
This thing you're in is the worst invention ever!
Never mind!" "You need the water more than I do.
Would you like me to row?
Seen any fish along the way?
I didn't realize a mirage would come true!
Ninety miles and you never looked back.!
Hey Sinbad, it's a no-wake zone; these swells are bad enough.
All I remember is the words "organic" and "freshly squeezed".
Squee'ek uh'k kk'kkkk squeek eee'eek!
You do realize this river has a sandy bottom.
You have no idea how hard this is on my hands and knees!
Are you happy? Now we've missed all of 2016!
No, I don't want to sing another round of 99 Bottles Of Beer On The Wall either!
Stop giving me the silent treatment! We tried it your way now it's my turn.
"Moses took care of this a hundred years ago, why won't you stop it already?!?
Which way are you going podner?
Man overboard, and all you care about is your Guinness world record and a pint of that infernal stout when we reach Dublin.
What makes you think you'll fit a couple of giraffes in that ark of yours Noah?
We're really up it WITHOUT a paddle.
If you say Hillary in 2020 on more time...
With all due respect, I can't believe you forgot the damned Evinrude.
What the rest of the US thinks the California drought looks like
What do you mean, "do I have my ticket for the SEA OF SAND line?"
It seems that the tides of time are not working in our favor.
I'll row when we get to the mirage.
You cannot handle the inconvenient truth about global warming.
What did you do now!
So who gets lifeboat insurance?!
Fred, hell man, we DO face a common futility!
Isn't it time to walk back the sandbar meme?
I heard this is a good spot for beached whale fishing
Seriously, you are missing out on so much of what this place has to offer by traveling through so quickly.
Just wait! Trump's gonna repeal that Obama-boat on Day One.
Hey, Newt, are you headed for the river?
My dingy is bigger than yours
Tell me more about miragefulness.
I am telling you this contraption is for the mythical element water.
Hey Earnhardt, watch where you're going!
Got an extra oar? My Evinrudes flooded!
You're not helping Scott!
No matter how thirsty you get, don't drink the saltwater!
I can't think straight. Can you use your scull to help me?
If you are going to row, you could, at least, let me sit
How much further is it to Pasadena?
Lousy Trump.
Hey, I thought we agreed you'd get a sailboat.
Turn around and come back! You're exactly the kind of intellect they're looking for in Washington now!
Am I on the right track here?
I just need a cup of it!
Get in, you weirdo.
Did I get my FedEx?
You never said anything about it being an ocean of SAND!
You don't happen to have any water skis on board?
IS THIS WORK OR RECREATION ?
No ride?! Fine, then you can't have any of my sand!
Could you stop exercising and help me dig?
It's *all* a mirage!
Hop on in. I'm headed to the pit of despair, myself.
"I think it's time I switch to the back stroke".
Hey, where's the nearest....oh, never mind.
You got the wrong size paddles again.
This is NOT a painted sea!
You got any water?
row faster Donald, we're getting nowhere.
Go green, right?
For the last time, I will not agree to disagree.
No - gently down the 'stream', not 'steam'
"A little something, you know, for the effort"!
Where did you get the water?
Are we both just hoping for rain?
I need some water to live." "I need some water water to get away from you!
My fault, I drank it all.
It really is all downhill from here now, bud.
bernie would've won
I know you said I was being marooned, but don't you think deserted would be more fitting?
Get your damn boat off of my oyster bed!
This isn't the Hoboken Ferry?
You wouldn't happen to have an extra beer around?
Got any extra water?
Basically what it feels like when you're low on gas and someone asks for a ride.
Trust me. You won't get very far in that old tub.
I though you said you could "turn the desert into pools of water and the parched ground into flowing springs"
Give it up already. It wasn't a hoax.
Could you please stop the waves, your splashing sand on me!
Is this what they mean when they say @realDonaldTrump unleashed a twitter storm?
No use rowing, Noah. The sun dried up all the water.
I want the Sands, I want the Mirage...we have to get into an argument in front of a Jennie who's never been to Vegas!
Who says it's better than 'Three Blind Mice'?
You whippersnappers! Always looking for a shortcut. Let me tell you something. In my day ... .
Are you sure cavemen worked out like this?
Are you rowing toward that gentle stream?
Parallel Universe, what do physics know?
It's easier to get around here on your hands and knees.
I'll hop in; we'll scull together--or, else, skull separately!
Is this going to Brooklyn?
If you tell me one more time to just be patient, this desert will turn back into an ocean one day I will bop you with that oar.
Noah, you sure you got that right?
We'll, perhaps the NAV is wrong!
How much longer are you going with this mirage thing?
What do you mean I don't look like my picture?
In the future, everything will be great.
No, I don't think singing "Working on a Chain Gang" would improve my efforts.
Dry enough for ya?
I've got a lot of dirt on you buster.
It's not working!
The CFO says "We need to power through the project".
One of us is right, God Damn It!
You'd abandon me to the sand?
One more verse of row, row, row your boat and I quit the swim team.
Global warming is a myth created by hombres without a boat.
I told you not to complain. Drowning's better than whatever this is.
I guess we should have paid the water bill...
this isnt the right place for a boat because there isnt any water
You're making a mirage look real!
If you're so sure it's not a mirage, could you give me some water?
STOP singing Row Row Row Your Boat! Open your eyes and smell the coffee!
Buddy, can you spare a dime?
I guess we do need Algebra.
Mom! Kevin hit me in the head again.
Move on--she chose Pacey.
I take my sun salutations seriously. What's your excuse?
Didn't you learn anything from bringing that knife to the gun fight?
Yes, just up ahead there's a fine stream and a whole merry group singing Row Your Boat.
I told you we should have sprung for the double scull. My turn if that water ahead turns out to be a mirage.
Which way to the Red Sea?
Ever heard the camel referred to as the ship of the desert? There's a corollary to that.
You seem up a beach without a paddle.
I said blue Gatorade not red Powerade!
What? It didn't have your name on it.
I told you it was just a mirage!
Water water everywhere but not a drop to drink.
I've had it with your singing "Life is but a Dream" even if you are a mirage.
Do you know where the next 2nd Avenue stop is?
Yeah, I gave up my chicken-wire canoe, and there ain't no cowgirl in the sand.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
No, I won't sing in rhyme with you.
Sherlock, admit it was an erroneous deduction!
Do you have any 30 SPF? I packed 15, and it's not quite strong enough.
I KNEW Putin had some dirt on Trump.
Sorry I'm late. Just snuck out of some hole in the wall.
Switch, the wading's killing me.
Yeah I m good... Just trying to get my money's worth.
Trump was so wrong about global warming, but he built a great wall - there must be a gap *somewhere*! How long have you been looking?
"Yes it's a sea . . . a SEA of SAND!!!!
"Stop that singing, you're not rowing, 'gently down the stream'".
Well, either mine's right or yours is, but both our mirages can't be.
You've been dry heaving for 10 miles.
I don't think that's what they meant.
Can you please stop showing off.
But I don't need a boat. God will save me!
Will you please stop with all the "water" comments?
NO, this isn't what they mean by a 'successful sand save,' you idiot!
This alternate reality approach isn't working.
Muck and meyer sun and sand Ditch the boat, and become man.
Sabulous.
Huh, I really thought that would work
The genie has a serious hearing problem: I wished for a float.
It's "we're going to die", not "were going to die"!
For Petessake, I'll row
JERK! You cut me off at the Euphrates!
I know they spit but still they seem more efficient somehow
Water water everywhere but not a drop to drink.
Yeah I m good... Just trying to get my money's worth.
There is guy, paddling in the sand. He heard someone asking for help. The guy looks like he wants to kill himself. He asks him if he come with him to the ocean. He said yes because he liked helping people. They shared the foods and became friends.
Cast adrift in an open boat,luxury !,l dreamed of an open boat.
