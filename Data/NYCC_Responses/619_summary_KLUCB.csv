6097,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,Jim needed to take a longer lunch today after his last appointment.
6070,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,It was a knight to remember.
6043,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,This is how we pick our CEO
6015,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,I told him not to downsize the Samurai Warrior Department.
6007,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,Looks like he finally got the point.
5965,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,"You know, he often treats us like serfs."
5856,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,It turned back into a desk after I stabbed it.
5815,4441,0,11,53,64,1.171875,0.04753177456453702,619,"Head hunting is now ""self-performed""."
5775,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,The last person that freed the sword got the axe.
5738,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,Not a good day to ask for a raise.
5650,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,"Get Arthur, quick."
5644,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,"Well, looks like Arthur left the office."
5624,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,Maybe I shouldn't have told H.R. that this job would be cutthroat.
5596,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,"It can't be removed until Trump is removed, or water turns to wine."
5472,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,"You won't become king, but we'll give you some extra vacation days."
5431,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,His inbox is a little unusual.
7318,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,It's mid-millenium modern.
7398,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,We updated our privacy policy.
9557,4441,0,11,53,64,1.171875,0.04753177456453702,619,Looks like an inside job.
8787,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,And so starts the legend of the sword in the credenza.
8781,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,Do you think he has a golden parachute?
8711,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,Not sure what happened here but it doesn't look good.
8693,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,"Whoso pulleth out this sword from this desk, is right wise CEO of all Divisions."
8629,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,It is said that whomever removeth the sword can have his laptop square-on instead of at that awful neck-crinking angle.
8616,4441,0,11,53,64,1.171875,0.04753177456453702,619,Double the stock shares if you can do it.
8612,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,The discussion was ended abruptly.
8587,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,At least he didn't tweet about you.
8578,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,We're waiting for our Machiavellian prince to show up.
8528,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,This was Arthur's office. He had angle issues.
8498,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,Slowly back out of the office and pull anything that looks like an alarm.
8475,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,I guess it's really the purse that mightier than the sword.
8370,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,"So, Artie, pull it out and the VP for Regional Sales Management position is yours. After you sign the employee arbitration agreement and undergo our standard background check, of course."
8366,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,"Actually, it is not a bad logo for a company that treats hemorrhoids. Applying our ointment is like freeing the sword and becoming King."
8271,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,We're still waiting on the right candidate
8798,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,He who can pull it out gets a workspace.
8236,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,Where's King Arthur when you need him?
8841,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,Your predecessor was transferred to the crusades division.
9013,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,I still think the keyboard is mightier than the sword
9608,4441,0,11,53,64,1.171875,0.04753177456453702,619,Call Arthur from H.R.
9631,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,The price you pay for a corner office
9701,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,We haven't quite cleared your new office.
4992,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,Excalibur LIVES ! My proof that this is MY DESK !
9670,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,He never liked that desk — called it a monster!
9475,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,"Well, it looks like Arthur finally resigned."
9456,4441,0,11,53,64,1.171875,0.04753177456453702,619,The new boss believes in setting high expectations.
9380,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,Arthur King quit last week
9352,4441,0,11,53,64,1.171875,0.04753177456453702,619,"His final words were,”It’s either me or the sword.”"
9342,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,Better go ask Arthur to come in here
9335,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,"At Facebook, we don’t just weaponize your private data."
9201,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,You sure this is where the 3:15 round table meeting is taking place?
9193,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,Vivianne took it pretty badly when he refused her that vacation time up at the lake.
9097,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,It looks like Damocles snuck out for an early lunch again.
9060,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,Call HR. Is Artie still in the mailroom?
8892,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,This turnaround is going to take a legendary CEO. So first...
7328,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,The CEO has decided. Arthur gets this office.
8229,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,He puts a lot of pressure on himself
8186,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,I think the Lady in The Typing Pool put it there.
7850,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,Two-edged sword boomerangs. 'Live by the sword die by the sword' not drinking the cool-aid?
7775,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,Conan has a very clear 'leave work at work' policy.
7719,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,There's only one job requirement.
7679,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,No one has occupied this position since King Arthur.
7672,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,The Board has one more requirement.
7622,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,"Well, this is not England, my name's not Arthur, and my desk's not made of stone!"
7607,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,"Turn the stock price around, you earn a $20 million bonus. If you don't, well..."
7593,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,The boss didn’t answer Katniss Everdeen’s question fast enough.
7590,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,"Your mythical achievements precede you, Arthur. You pull the sword out of the desk, not only is the job yours, but interest rates will rise 10-15%, tops."
7538,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,He must be gone for the knight.
7467,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,"The last guy said he couldn't get it out, I would just work around it 'til Arthur from facilities can take a look."
7452,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,It's been foretold that whoever pulls the sword from the desk is the rightful CEO.
7422,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,That's one way to get your point across.
7419,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,It is a new approach for selecting a new CEO.
7410,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,Too bad he is gone - he had great penmanship.
7851,4441,0,11,53,64,1.171875,0.04753177456453702,619,I told you they were going to fire Conan.
8206,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,They call it merit based promotions.
7853,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,Typically concise.
7890,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,I asked for a high caliber desk.
8153,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,"If you ask me, the Board has set their CEO search standards way too high."
9635,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,Lancelot came by but he was more interested in our receptionist.
8137,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,It still comes under my freedom of expression right?
8105,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,Looks like we'll find him at the jousting gym
8104,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,How bad do you wan this job?
8089,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,"The competition got the Lady, AND the Lake."
8080,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,Don't believe all the myths about working here.
8078,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,Your predecessor just didn't have executive caliber.
8075,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,"Well Arthur, if you want to become the new CEO..."
8009,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,And here's Art's desk.
7972,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,I wouldn’t touch it until after the S.E.C. fraud ruling comes down.
7951,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,We’ve eliminated performance evaluations. All you need to do is pull out the sword.
7930,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,The consultants on succession planning recommended this.
7923,4441,0,11,53,64,1.171875,0.04753177456453702,619,"I'm so nervous, pull my finger."
7912,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,"It's a tough choice. If I pull it out, Rudy will put me on the President's defense team."
7888,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,Well this will sure change the shape of the candidate pool.
4983,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,I told you something swordid would happen to Frank eventually.
1340,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,"A word to the wise, don’t broach the subject of a corner office."
4965,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,"Donald and Hillary will be here at 4. Finally, our country should be able to move on."
1621,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,Pull it out of the desk and you get to be CEO.
1603,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,I thought we were an autonomous collective!
1591,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,I think the new boss is trying to make point.
1577,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,You try it! I don’t want to be CEO.
1576,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,I worry its not aware of the impact of implicit biases
1560,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,"Bryan: “Woah, that is one big sword” Hector: “That’s what she said...”"
1633,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,"I understand if you can pull out the sword, it becomes your desk. Maybe..."
1541,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,They have a generous encouraged-retirement plan.
1519,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,It gets harder and harder to get a corner office.
1518,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,"Your name's Arthur, right?"
1513,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,"Of course, since I live backwards in time, as soon as you pull that out I'm shorting the stock."
1478,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,Succession is an age-old custom here; see if you can pull the sword out of the desk.
1406,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,Whoso pulleth out this sword of this desk is rightwise middle manager of all lower managers.
1389,4441,0,11,53,64,1.171875,0.04753177456453702,619,"Your new corner office. If you get bored, you can try to pull that sword thingie from the desk, but so far no one but Ferguson's kid has done it."
1532,4441,2,7,55,64,1.171875,0.0570204619879343,619,"You won't be king, you'll be CEO."
1386,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,"Its either a message from the Board, or a challenge for the next CEO. Or both."
1673,4441,3,5,56,64,1.171875,0.06121572372641858,619,"Here at Excalibur Inc., we ask every employee to pull the sword from the hooker hiding under our leader's desk"
1772,4441,1,9,54,64,1.171875,0.05249096435850378,619,Legend has it there's a millenial out there who can pull it to become our next CEO... so we don't let any of them up here.
