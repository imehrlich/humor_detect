Who's endangered now?
They were never going to find you anyway
Sorry...I was texting.
Yeah, well your profile wasn't exactly honest either.
I'd like to settle this without involving my insurance company.
Sorry mate, I was swimming and texting.
Sorry, totally thought I could jump it.
Ironically, I'm not even a killer whale.
I ain't heavy, I'm your blubber.
We should probably exchange insurance information.
You were right, white whales can't jump.
Online you said you were a dolphin.
Hold still, dammit, I'm trying to get the hook out.
Did I land on a palm tree or are you just happy to see me?
Those aren't coconuts.
So, any chance you could push me back into the water?
Who's the endangered species now?
He ain't heavy, he's my blubber.
I thought your sign said, "Kelp"
You have to hide me. I'm being stalked by some crazy guy with a wooden leg.
My therapist was right. I do put too much pressure on people.
I was wrong, being ALONE on a deserted island isn't the worst thing that can happen!
I guess now, I'm a killer whale.
... Polo!
Moby, stop being such a dick!
I vote you off the island.
I just had lunch and can't go back in the water for at least an hour.
Does this island make me look fat?
Looks like my sonar worked about as well as your GPS.
NOW it's a deserted island
Look, I'm not thrilled about it either.
Jeff survived for 209 days on the island, but in the end, it was a fluke accident that did him in.
It looked bigger underwater.
The good news is, you're not alone anymore!
Sorry. I thought it said "Kelp."
I'm sorry. I was texting.
I know I know - don't text and swim.
It's mostly water weight.
What part of "catch and release" didn't you understand?
He thought nothing could compare to the crushing weight of isolation.
Your photo on Airbnb made it look so much larger.
You sure I'm not imposing?
It looked a lot bigger on AirBnB.
Me! What are YOU doing here?
Frankly, I'll be happy to see rising sea levels.
Well, it's not like they call me Moby Nice Guy.
Stop whining, I can't breathe either.
I've just voted you off the island.
I know, I know. I shouldn't have been texting.
Yeah? It's not exactly a day at the beach for me either buddy.
Okay, we'll try it with you on top.
Call him Squishmael.
That's right. My last name is Dick and I'm a sperm whale. Still think its funny?
After years of practice, Harold finally perfected the whale call.
I think last night was a mistake.
Relax. This could make a great novel.
You're it.
When you asked me the one thing I'd bring to a desert island and I said "Moby Dick," I meant the book.
I guess now I'll call you Squishmael.
On the bright side, you still have two wishes left
And you thought things couldn't get worse.
Give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish -- and this can happen.
You can't breathe? I can't breathe!
Well frankly, it’s not that comfortable for me either.
Everything changed when the relationship became physical.
Think we can settle this without insurance?
Lube, Oil, Filter. You're good for another 10,000 miles.
Marco...
And in an instant, the fine art of whale calling was lost forever.
Sorry. You're right...I shouldn't text and swim.
Sorry, I was texting while swimming.
Try lifting with your legs.
If a guy named Ahab shows up, you haven't seen me.
Don't make me tell you again: 'humpback' is derogatory.
I told you the hammock wouldn't hold us both.
Listen, if a guy with a peg leg comes by looking for me, remember - I was never here.
I'm like the elephant in the room. Only I'm a whale, and this is an island.
Recalculating . . .
I decided I'd rather be a big fish on a small island.
This timeshare isn’t working out.
Now I can call you Squishmael.
1 down, 7.4 billion to go.
It gets worse. Why do you think they call us "sperm whales?"
Crowded beach, no nightlife, lumpy bed--one star.
That's the last time I try to text and migrate at the same time!
It looked bigger on Airbnb, right?
I thought you said, "Kelp!"
Having fallen overboard from a Greenpeace anti-whaling ship, Tom was eventually recovered from what would later be known as Irony Island.
I got your message. How can I help?
Stop your blubbering.
This just in: Beached whale annihilates entire population of South Pacific island.
Okay Bill, you can reach the coconuts now. Bill?
Lucas orders Moby Dick from Amazon but neglects to check the "book" box.
It's not deserted anymore!
Ooh, that tickles, is your phone on vibrate?
I am NOT a fish out of water.
It looked bigger on airbnb.
Maybe Twister isn't the best choice for game night...
You're the one who wanted to go whale watching. CAN YOU SEE ME NOW?
Worst. Beach. Ever.
I guess I just discovered the Isle of Man.
Sit tight, high tide is only a few hours away.
That's not my blowhole.
You are getting way too big to be a lap whale.
Peter thought he had cheated death after the plane crash. Death doesn't like cheaters.
Lord, not to seem ungrateful, but a flounder or a mackerel would have sufficed.
Yeah, well, you're not my first choice either.
You never call me, Ishmael.
The Orcas were right. White whales can't jump.
Ok, on three.
OK, you were right, I can't clear the palm tree.
Help is on the way. I'm wearing a tracking device.
Sorry. I thought I had the time share this week.
Tell me honestly, does this island make me look fat?
We need to discuss boundaries.
Marine biologists don't understand why we do it and frankly neither do I.
I don't know if anyone has ever told you this, but you're a really good listener.
Can I call you Squishmael?
Sorry, I thought those stones spelled "KELP".
Don't complain. You have plenty of leg room.
I identify as a land mammal.
About 12 metric tons. Why do you ask?
Stuck the landing!
Don't worry, high tide's in six hours.
Go island hopping, she says, it’ll be fun, she says
Ok, big push on three....
My travel agent warned me the island would be overbooked.
I was texting.
I'd say it's more of a whaled beach.
Hold on! Just six hours 'til high tide.
One of us should swim for help.
You're so hungry you could eat a what?!
That'll be $22.00 for the pizza less $1.50 for the anchovies which I ate.
We're going to need a bigger island.
You're right. I couldn't clear the tree.
But there are sharks in there!
I could have sworn I heard somebody yelling for help.
Sorry, but Shark Week scares the hell out of me.
Sorry! Just island hopping.
Clean up on Isle 1.
I bet you were more worried about lightning.
Sorry. I cleared it last time.
You're right. It probably does hurt you more than it hurts me.
If you were wishing for the novel, you should have been more specific.
Am I the first to arrive?
We prefer to think of it as a whaled beach.
It doesn't really matter who was here first.
My bad
I said the BOOK I wanted on a desert island was Moby Dick.
Next time we pick coconuts you better stand on MY back.
Could you push me back in?
This spot taken?
It looked bigger in the brochure.
Hang in there - Just a few hours until high tide.
Look, buddy - we're BOTH having a bad day...
Did you call me, Ishmael?
Life's a beach, and then you die.
Relax, I'm a vegetarian.
Next time hold the hoop higher...
Okay you win, call me Squishmael!
Ahab was crushed by Moby's initial display of friendship.
Really stuck that landing, didn't I . . . ?
Stop blubbering.
I hate these layovers as much as you.
The brochure read: Private island paradise with unbelievable marine wildlife encounters.
What's our safe word again?
You're right--this island does make me look fat.
Sorry there was a Pokemon in your palm tree.
Maybe YOU should get on MY back and I'LL try to swim us out of here.
Tell the truth, does this island make me look fat?
This is what happens when you buy a whale watching tour on Groupon.
Now do my back.
Harold regretted that he had jerked the fishing line so hard.
We're gonna need a bigger island.
I got your note in the bottle. How can I help?
No whale is an island, either.
Right! Objects may be closer than they appear.
That’s it…you’re voted off the island!
Your prayers ARE being answered. The loaves will arrive tomorrow.
Ishmael?
Lift with your legs, not your back.
I'm beaching myself for reasons that science has been unable to adequately explain. What the hell are *you* doing?
Dry hump?
Your message in a bottle said, 'Single man looking for a whale of a time.'
Now you have to say "Marco"...
Of all the sand bars in all the oceans in all the world, he walks into mine.
It'll seem funnier when you tell it later
Sometimes you’re a little hard to swallow.
While you're under there could you check my oil?
Why don't we try with you on top...
Good news... the tide's coming in.
I'm also under a lot of pressure, OK?
Sorry, I was playing Pokémon Go.
If it's any consolation, I'm uncomfortable too.
..you awake?
I hate layovers.
If you're not too busy I'd like to talk to you about our lord and savior, Poseidon.
Casablanca, Free Willy and Beaches. What are yours?
I thought I heard someone say KELP!
It took forever to get the message out of the bottle, but I came as fast as I could.
Call me Squish-mael...
Bob misunderstood his realtor when he recommended a flat in Wales.
Okay push on three...
Now, in game theory, they would refer to this as the lose-lose scenario.
It looked a lot bigger in the Airbnb photo.
I can't define irony, but I know it when I see it.
You're in my spot.
Not until you take the hook out.
"Whales love me. I have the best whales." -Donald Trump from underneath a whale
Sorry about your tree.
Hug a tree. Save a whale. Blah, blah blah.
If this is high tide we're both going to have a bad day
I just needed a hug.
Sorry, it looked bigger on the Airbnb website.
At least you're out of the sun.
Photobomb!
This is no day at the beach for me, either.
We never go anywhere.
Who is so hungry he could eat a whale now?
Sorry. I just ate and need to wait 30 minutes.
It's hump day.
When you told that genie that you wanted to be on a desert island with a copy of Moby Dick, you probably should have been more specific.
Sorry-- looking for a pokemon.
Curse you, Googlemaps!
Yeah, but I identify as a seagull.
I heard this place used to be called Florida.
Be careful what you fish for.
Stu, let me call you back. I'm in the middle of something.
Welcome to the island of My Orca.
I don't suppose you could give me a push?
Well this is awkward. From behind you looked like my wife.
Oops..sorry I was just out island hopping.
Go ahead. Try to throw me back.
Next time you hug the trees and I'll save the whales
Double twist. Nailed it.
High tide's only 4 hours away
It used to be called the Isle of Man.
Guess who got voted off the island.
Stop whining. I am stranded too.
Why the hell is there a speed bump HERE?
You know, this is just as uncomfortable for me as it is for you.
Like you've never stepped in a puddle.
It's just water weight
I found your note in the bottle.
I don't see why I have to move out if you are the one with the issue
I've been coming here in August for years.
This island looked much larger on Airbnb.
At least I get points for sticking the landing.
A little higher, no, no. a little to the left . there, there , that's it. ahhhhh.
Crap. Another speed bump.
Day 44: While a prayer is finally answered, I realize I will need to be much more specific in my requests.
A little to the left.....Ahhhh that's the spot.
Hurry up. My husband will resurface any minute.
Well, for your information, my day's not going so well either.
Don't be a dick, Moby.
I hope this was helpful in getting you down from the tree?
Maybe we should try it with you on top.
PoloOOOO!
This is 911. Please state your emergency and location.
I got your bottle.
Are you all right? I was texting.
You wanna check the oil while you're under there?
Quit your blubbering!
In regards to Waldo, I have both good news and bad news.
I thought you were waving at me.
'So anyway, the condition is called aquaphobia.'
Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a lifetime!
Yes, I was texting, but you'll have a hard time proving it.
Perhaps Gilligan should have been a bit more specific when he wished for a voluptuous female companion on his deserted island...
I just arrived, can you recommend some fun things to do on the Island?
And to think I was worried about a coconut falling on my head.
On the bright side more of a chance getting rescued by environmentalists
C'mon, lift with your legs.
Let me know the second you feel uncomfortable.
They made that jump look so easy in "Free Willy."
Of all the desert islands, in all the oceans, in all the world...
Do you think you could scratch it a little more to the left?
Well I am actually much lighter under water!
Just think of me as SPF 1000.
'"Consider this payback for SeaWorld."
How about that? Same odds as Trump being elected!
Sorry, but I'm just island hopping.
I think I stuck that landing don't you? Hello?
I feel like such a blowhole.
Push on three.
At 7:28 a.m. on the morning of August 8th, Robinson Crusoe picked what would be his last coconut.
Found another Pokémon!
At first, global warming came for the polar bears, and I said nothing.
There! Now you can reach the coconuts.
The less compelling first draft of Moby Dick.
NOW who's the Sole Survivor?
I don't think this is how sperm banks are supposed to work...
Carl's new bait proved unbelievably effective.
You're krilling me!
You requested an Uber?
Damn that Google Maps.
High tide is when?
I will definitely mention overcrowding in my online review.
Let's be fair—we're suffocating each other.
Oh, stop blubbering about it!
I came as soon as I saw the flare!
And here I was worried about Zika.
Ok now, lower, lower... and a little to the left.
This is very bad news for all three of us.
Sorry, dude. I thought you said "kelp."
You're such a Dick, Moby.
Of all the beaches in all the islands in all the world, she swims onto mine.
MARCO!"......."fffffolo
You will just have to wait till High Tide.
I think we're gonna need a bigger island.
Teaching his pet whale to fetch did not end well for either of them.
"So is this whale watch 'up close and personal' enough for you?".
It's not like I want to be here, either.
Quiet! I'm playing hide-and-seek with the dolphins.
It looked so much bigger in the brochure.
The dolphins make it look so easy.
Earl finally lands the catch of a lifetime.
Uncle.
The island looked much bigger in the brochure.
I gotta tell ya, I feel like a total Moby Dick about this.
Spacious private island? I'd say the reviews were misleading.
I think we could both benefit from high tide!
So much for Witness Protection!
Can I still call you Ishmael?
There goes my Uber rating
After you're done changing the oil, would you clean the blowhole?
Ted prayed he could catch enough to live for a year.
No way man, there are sharks in there.
Rock, paper, whale. I win.
Sorry. I'm being chased by a peg-legged lunatic.
Have you tried lifting with your legs?
Yeah, it doesn't feel right for me, either.
I don't think we were quite ready for the "Dirty Dancing" lift
Found your message-in-a-bottle; came as fast as I could.
Just push me back in the water and I'll try the jump again.
Higher. Higher….Now a little left…. Oh yes, right there. Oh yes! Yes! Yes!
Stupid genie! I wished for SHAMPOO!
Jonah's selfie with the whale did not quite go to plan
Of all the islands, in all the oceans, in all the world, she jumps onto mine…
I never saw you atoll!
I got your S.O.S.
Is it ten compressions, then two breaths?
That was some wave, huh?
A little to the right, just below, more, that's it--Ahhh!
You raised me from a baby, but now it's better for us both if I move on.
I'm still voting for Bernie.
Did you say 'Polo'?
Hey, would you mind pushing me back in?
Now this is what I call a fluke accident.
Why did I drink and dive?
Marco...Marco...Marco....
A little more to the left - under the dorsal - that's it! Ah - h - h!
I'm imagining the odds right now.
I'm guessing this concludes another survivor episode.
OK, calling you "blubber-butt" was way out of line.
Next time we should go to my place.
Nailed the landing!
They’ll find us. Beached whales always draw a crowd.
I don't understand! First you ask to be rescued and now you say I'm smothering you
Did you forget our safeword again?
Geez did you see the size of that shark?
Not that it's any consolation, but you won't catch me texting and swimming again.
'You'll have the beach practically to yourself.' Quote unquote.
My biggest catch ever, and no one to see it.
This really blows...
Huh, it shows a pokemon right here.
It was just one damn message in a bottle too many.
Actually, I'm a killer whale.
Call me back in a few minutes. I'm trying to rescue a beached whale.
I think we're both screwed.
What'd you expect? I'm a humpback.
It wasn't supposed to end this way, Jonah.
Sorry, I thought I saw a Pokemon.
No worries! High tide is in an hour.
So, you're a whale watcher?
Oh, please. Stop blubbering.
The top 1% of mammals controls 99% of the land.
Tell the truth now; does this island make me look fat?
#crushingit
This island hopping sure takes atoll
This blows.
We're gonna need a bigger atoll.
Although it's self-serving, let's hope this whole "rising sea levels" thing is much quicker than expected.
These speed bumps are killers.
I can scooch over a bit if you are uncomfortable.
I see a plane! Wave your arms! Wave your arms!
Did you see that scary ship go by?
I can't resist photobombing selfies.
We really should start thinking about getting a bigger place.
I'll call you "Squishmael".
In the end, it turns out that that no man is an island.
Thank you for your generous contribution to Greenpeace.
Excuse me for breaching.
Sorry. I used to be able to sail over this baby.
Saw your note in the bottle. Got here as fast as I could. Now what?
Saw your SOS signal. How can I help you?
I told you this swimsuit makes me look like a beached whale.
Dear God, man, put your back into it.
... So ... I guess what I'm really trying to say is ... I have a really big crush on you
Does this desert island make me look fat?
Sorry. Thought this was deserted.
Looks like you're gonna need an implant and a couple of crowns.
I'll be off soon. I've got another pressing engagement.
GPS is recalibrating.
Well, this is embarrassing. I was the one who ran into your sailboat last month.
On the bright side, at least you're not alone anymore.
Pardon me, but does this island make me look fat?
There must be a better way to open a coconut.
Just you and me, Ahab. No harpoons, no sailors, no boats.
Quit Complaining. I could have been a killer whale.
Sorry, the next rest area was in 8400 miles
Yep, it's gallstones, alright. Hand me my pliers.
well.. this blows!
I love you too, Moby, but we need to set boundaries.
Remember, lift with your legs.
Can you hear me now?
Told you things could get worse.
Jonah's less-celebrated younger brother
Your message in the bottle said you desperately wanted company...
Fluke accident.
Oops. My bad.
Glad you got my bottle. The message clearly stated Seeking Female though.
Yeah, well, this one's for Moby.
Can you scooch over a bit?
Are you stranded too?
You mean you weren't screaming "Kelp!"?
What are the odds--my name's Willy too!
We're going to make the island really great again.
Sorry, were you sitting there?
Geez, I'm sorry. Were you here first?
I asked you nicely not to call me a fish
High degree of difficulty and I stuck the landing!
I mean, what were the odds?
I'm sorry, but you were standing on a very rare Pokémon.
This is the worst trust-building exercise ever.
Ooh, yeah, there. Scratch right there.
Uber here ..
Genie: you misunderstood… I said what would make my desert isle vacation complete was a nice, cold “ALE”!
We'll always have high tide.
One of us has got to go.
Be sure to tell me if I'm applying too much pressure.
A snack & a toothpick... How thoughtful...
Hey, at least I stuck the landing.
These layovers are a killer!
Then write SOS, not Free Hugs.
I think I prefer the loneliness.
I'm a rescue whale.
Dang - I was sure I could clear it easily.
Sorry, I still haven't gotten used to these new Chinese islands.
Endangered species, my ass.
I guess white whales _can't_ jump.
No doubt about it, Gilligan. You were here first.
On the other hand, you did get a lot more out of this whale watching trip than you expected!
you look like you needed a hug....
Beached, stranded, crushed ...does it really matter?
Damn Mapquest!
There's a reason why my last name is Dick.
Go ahead, Larry, call me "blubber butt" again.
I've fallen and I can't get up.
Oh what, now you prefer the crushing loneliness?
You just gonna lie there or are you gonna give me a push?
Small world, Ahab.
Jonah, the irony of this situation is not lost on me.
Can you scoot over a little bit?
On second thought, maybe you should be on top.
Oh my God - I've grown legs!
Lance was beginning to regret that he had wished for company.
Should I blow for help?
Free Willie movie bloopers
On tropical island. Having whale of a time. Love, Jonah
It appears cuddling is going to be a problem in our relationship.
Ahhh! That feels great. Now, a little to the left.
Your ex-wife would find this ironic.
I got your distress note in a bottle and got here as fast as I could.
Give up, yet?
Hey look - a rescue boat! What are the odds?
Quick! Hide me! This Ahab guy is nuts!
I DID yell cannonball!
Whales Gone Wild: Spring Break 2016
What a fluke!
Darwin said this would be subtler.
Have some compassion man! Push me back in!
Or . . . would you rather be on top?
You order an Uber?
Sorry...I was looking for a Pokemon.
Do you want me to leave?
I'm just waiting for high tide
Had enough, Ahab?
Get off my lawn.
So a whale walks into a sandbar...
I'm sorry. This must be some kind of fluke.
Damn Google Earth!
There is such a thing as too much sushi.
In the last Olympics, I made that jump.
Dang! I meant to breach, not beach.
Sorry -- I thought you were waving me over.
Sorry. From a distance, it looked just like a female presenting.
So much for island hopping.
I am big. It's the islands that got small.
Are you saying 'kelp' or 'help'?
I'm guessing you wished for the novel.
It's now my island Gilligan.
Does it look infected?
Excuse me, sir, do you have a moment to talk about Jesus Christ?
What can I say? I'm a beached whale. It's what I do.
Call me a fish once, shame on you. Call me a fish twice...
The irony is that we invented GPS
Extreme whale watching
At least you're in the shade.
I was counting on the sea levels rising a little faster.
And then he said I'm "smothering" him. Can you believe that?
Can I call you back a little later, Mom?
Next time can I be on top?
I was just following my GPS
When I said I would take along Moby Dick on a desert island, I meant the book.
Of all the sand bars in all the seas in all the world...
But my towel has been here since 6 AM
Watch out! Shark!
The whale call was surprisingly effective.
I need a hug
Man, I hate these speed bumps.
Fluke landing
Stop wailing!
Love hurts.
Sorry. I thought this island was deserted.
Paper beats rock.
So this is what happens when you put the lime in the coconut
Not so endangered now, am I?
While you're there, could you scratch my belly?
Yeah, well, it's been a bad day for me too.
I love this cafe. The human is always good and they come with their own toothpicks
Marco!.....Marco!!...
OK. You pinned me. How about 2 out of 3?
Pardon my breach.
No,no . . . more to the left.
Moby Dick finally finds Waldo.
I'm thinking there might not be room on this island for the two of us.
Sorry to barge in on you, but is this a PokéStop?
Cut! Let's try it again. Do we have any stunt doubles left?
Thank goodness he wasn't endangered.
This place has gotten so touristy.
I hope they don't send me back to Sea World for this.
I think one of us should get back in the water.
Tell that idiot genie my wish was for MAIL!
Sorry, is this a private beach?
No, you can call ME Ishmael!
You can be honest, am I to heavy to be on top.
Happy Hump Day
Just scratch my belly for thirty seconds and I promise I'll get off.
EVERY man is an island.
This relationship is smothering me.
But I stuck the landing.
Is it always this crowded? I feel like we're on top of each other.
I'm one of the whales they saved.
Full disclosure, I may have lied about being an Orca on my profile.
Just when I thought things couldn't get any worse.
...must be hump day...
Speak up, you're sounding muffled.
Well, *this* is a lose-lose situation.
I should have used Google Maps.
So much for sonar.
It worked in Sea World.
So I'm thinking that was probably our last Frisbee game.
I do wish you would greet me a bit less enthusiastically.
I booked this island MONTHS ago.
If it's any consolation to you, Ahab, Queequeg got away and they named a coffee cafe chain after Starbuck.
Yeah, now you know why they call me Dick.
"The sign clearly says "Private Beach"!
Your look different than your profile photo
I was texting while breaching.
Hey Moby, you're crushing my dick.
Many years after being free, Willy, getting on in his age, was no longer able to perform the trick that made him famous.
Looks like you're down a quart of sperm oil Moby.
Moby. What's yours?
I could swear there was someone on this island.
Size matters.
I just wanted a hug.
The itch is just a little more to the right.
Don't be a Dick, Moby! Find your own island.
Say uncle! Say it!
Enough of Twister, let's just stick with Tic-Tac-Toe.
Pardon me, do you have any Grey Poupon?
Well...You're a couple of liters low on your oil...and you could stand to loose another ton of blubber.
OK. OK. I believe in climate change. Now will you get off me?
Are you endangered?
I heard you saying the loneliness was the worst part of being stranded.
It had a high Degree of Difficulty.
That's our show, folks. We'll be here again tomorrow, 10, 2 and 4. Remember to visit the gift shop.
Strand here often?
That's for calling me Shamu.
a whaled beach.
I'm a mammal. You're a mammal. Let's make the most of this.
Thanks a lot, Greenpeace.
I guess this is what Airbnb means by a "Shared room"
Yet another inconvenient truth.
Sorry, I thought you were someone else.
Nice whale-call, jerk face.
Sorry, bud. My chute wouldn't open.
Gilligan's Island: Alternate Ending
Ishmael, Squishmael
Would you prefer to be on top?
If you were wishing for the actual book, you should have been more specific.
Beached Front Property
You're it, little buddy!
I, too, find dry land suffocating.
Of all the beaches in all the world....
I told China this was my island.
Sorry, meant to breach, not beach
So sorry. I mistook this island for a female.
My pod voted me ON the island.
Sorry, my bad.
Watch the hands, mister!
God said that you were supposed to SWALLOW me.
You're it! Dan?
You should have built a wall.
Your fishing buddies are never gonna believe this one.
Yep,you're leakin'oil.
Of all the desert islands in all oceans in all the world, you had to breach into mine.
Sorry, I was using Pokemon Go.
Whadya mean, "Go, hump someone your own size."
Just a bit more toward my left pectoral fin . . . that's it, keep scratching!
Sorry, I thought a hug would help.
I'm getting too big for my breaches.
I see what's wrong, but I have to order the part.
Are you Jeremy? I'm your Uber.
I know, I'm heavier than I look.
Your island looked much larger in the brochure.
Please stop blubbering all over me!
Your Sperm Count is now up to one.
Who do you think is easier to spot from the sky?
Lower. Yeah, right there.
Well, it was a retirement fantasy of mine, too . . .
Moby... Get off! You're being a dick.
Call me Squished Male.
That feels really good, now just a little up and to the right.
They say vacation sex is better, but I'm not feeling it.
This is nothing like the brochure!
It's nothing personal just symbolic literary stuff.
Agreed, no more stupid pet tricks
Are you saying this relationship is too much for you?
Sorry, just ate. Get comfortable. I can’t go back in for at least an hour.
You looked like you might need a hug.
Be honest. Does this island make me look fat?
Sorry about the tree.
You had me at "Thar!"
It's okay, this is still less pressure than at home.
Moby, you dick!
I guess the genie's never heard of Wales, either.
The moment Herman Melville's writer's block ended.
Of all the islands, in all the oceans, in all the world...
In my defense, this island came out of nowhere.
I'm from the government, and I'm here to help.
Just my luck; I finally catch a fish, and now I can't light a fire.
I think we should try bunk beds.
Fins look fine, but you could use an oil change.
In retrospect, maybe *you* should have climbed the tree for a better view.
Hey... I think I found Waldo.
Did someone here request an Uber?
This vacation spot looked bigger in the pictures.
Uh, yup. Looks like a cavity to me.
The two of us can't be on the hammock at the same time.
But you swore you'd still love me even if one day I turned into a big fat whale.
Would you like to be on top?
Did I stick the landing?
Moby's quest for the great white male ends.
And here I thought being stranded on a desert island was the worst it could get.
Not until you apologize for calling my mother a cow.
Really, what were the chances of this happening?
You kept waving so here I am!
This is for SeaWorld.
I didn’t think I was a killer whale.
The alternate ending to Cast Away.
Damn GPS!
What would Jonah do?
OK, that should do it." "Come back Thursday and I will install the crown.
Crushed it!
...You wanted to watch whales...WATCH THIS !!
Who's the Moby Dick now?
Aaargh ! Oh, God, why the hell did I download that whale mating call ringtone onto my mobile ?
Well I jumped the shark.
No man is an island.
It's not you, it's me.
What doesn't kill you...oh, never mind.
Quick, irony or coincidence?
I mean that ship was coming straight at me! So, yes, I swerved to avoid it.
Sorry. It always worked in practice.
A little higher. A little higher. That's it.
No, I wished for a "well".
Could've sworn you yelled 'Kelp!'
Of all the islands, in all the oceans, you have to pick this one.
Don't you hate it when a resort overbooks?
It worked much better back at Sea World.
Tell me again: Who gave dominion to whom, and over what?
Wait, you haven't even heard me sing.
We're going to need a bigger boat.
Sorry, I didn't see you atoll.
Sorry, I saw the SeaWorld t-shirt and panicked
That was some storm last night!
Now who's blubbering?!
Size DOES matter!
Good, boy, good, boy. Now, roll over!
Noooooo...........God, I wanted a well!
It's just for a few days.. Til I get back on my fins..
Remember me, Ishmael?
No one will ever believe you.
Apparently you're right, this island's not big enough for the two of us.
You win, I couldn't jump over the palm.
OK OK! So I really don't know what a fish out of water feels like.
Melville's fieldwork did not begin as planned...
I am on my side.
The French version of "Free Willy" has a very different ending.
Good boy, now roll over...
Rock, Palm, Whale...I win.
Jonah, we really don't have to do this.
Of all the islands in all the world, he beaches on mine.
OK, tag doesn't work. How about hide and seek?
'Now I'll never get the Sea World job'
Of all the islands, in all the oceans, in all the world, she swims onto mine.
No, you call me Ishmail.
It looks like your flipper's damaged and your baleen's clogged.
Maybe island hopping isn't for me.
You can swim, but you can't hide, Ishmael!
The Save the Whales people aren't going to like this.
A little lower...
I hate it when you lie on the beach and there's a little rock right beneath you.
Look, next time they ask what you want on a desert island, specify that you meant the book and not the whale. This is no fun for me either.
I'm not throwing you back.
I feel like a fish out of water.
Amazon Prime delivery !
It's Moby RICHARD and that's the last time you are going to call me that!
'You just don't get the concept of sharing atoll.'
In all fairness, the ad did promise a whale of a time.
This layover is killing me
Boy, island hopping IS fun.
"So this ginormous wave beaches me on this tiny island...Hey, you still listening?
Little did he know that being marooned on a desert island would be the least of his problems.
I was making a distress call. Not a mating call!
You know I used to be a land mammal too.
Next time, you on top.
Wb buu plb et uff ub mu!!!
Ok, I take it back. You don't look like a beached whale.
Just as I suspected. You're down two quarts.
Perhaps CPR wasn't the best idea.
I saw it first.
I'm here on a fluke.
I sensed you needed a hug.
You think you have problems? I'm the one who's beached here!
Hi! Found your note in a bottle.
What could be worse than being stranded on a beach?
Thanks for fitting me in. I had the Ahab dream again.
You OK Jonah?
Could you move your palm just a little to the left?
The good news is I'm actually Moby Bob and I'm vegan.
Hi Mom, its Jonah, I only have a minute before we go back under and lose cell phone service...
No worries, I'm not a sperm whale.
I hope he didn't work for Greenpeace.
Of all the deserted islands in all the towns in all the world, you land on mine
Okay, Okay! I'm sorry I was texting while swimming.
I'm lonely too but I think we should keep things platonic.
What do you mean, you were here first?
Would you mind giving me a push?
Frank was always under pressure...even on vacation.
My sonar's been a bit off since mating season started.
Generally speaking, the hard part of "catch and release" is catch.
I guess they were right when they said no man is an island.
Just think, what are the odds?
You try swimming for 50 years without a rest"
I thought you were screaming, "Kelp!"
I don't think this island is big enough for both of us
sorry i thought i had the isle seat
I told you, no man is an island.
Nooooo! I said "MAIL. I wish I'd get MAIL."
You called for an uber?
I'm having a bad day, too.
Of all the islands in all the world you had to pick this one.
Imagine: the best fish story ever falls into your lap and you have no way to tweet about it.
Beware of what you fish for.
For future reference, it's not "blubber", it's muscle.
I guess it wasn't a mirage
Look- it's a ship! You're saved!
Beach access is members-only.
Darn... Free Willy made it look so easy...
It's mine now Gilligan !
I was lonely, too.
Who's the beach now?
You're mumbling again.
You looked like you could use a hug.
Sorry, I was on cruise control.
Ahhh, that's the spot.
Statistically at least, you made it into a far more esoteric group than 'death by falling coconut'.
Free Willy made it look so easy.
So if you were stranded on a desert island with just one mammal, which one would you choose?
On second thought, you get on my back.
This is bad for me too, you know.
First chest compressions, then mouth to mouth.
So is Ishmael a family name?
Oh, did you want to be on top?
There goes the neighbor.
My place next time?
Ishmael! Well I'll be damned!
The real estate agent advertised this island as deserted.
Of all the islands, in all the oceans in all the world, she beached onto mine
O.K.! You don't have to call me Ishmael.
Next time, it'll be the loan shark. And he uses his teeth.
You'll receive an email from the resort staff asking you to evaluate me. Can I count on you to give me a 5?
Did you miss me too, Jonah?
It's funny, my ex also said I was a crushing disappointment
I wasn't waving at you!
I started off as a land mammal, you know.
What? You've never heard of a whaled beach?
No man is an island but he can be dinner
Am I too over the top?
Gonna need a bigger island!
Sorry. It looked so much bigger in the brochure.
Maybe we should have gone back to my place.
I could swear this wasn't here last year.
Siri said there was a krill bar right here!
I'm sorry, I didn't think anyone came here anymore.
Still want to be a marine biologist?
Group hug!
I''m lonely too!
Just a little to the left. Ahhhhh, that's it.
This is not what I meant when I said "I needed sunblock".
Kelp!
OOH! That helps, but could you just scratch a little farther to the right!?
Thank goodness I saw your rescue flare.
I told you I didn't want to play, "Free Willy".
Yikes! When did they install speed bumps?
Maybe now I can hang with the Killer Whales.
Wow, Moby. You really are a dick.
Am I early?
The itch is a little over to the left.
So this is crushing loneliness.
I know -- yuuge! A lot of people tell me that.
You can run but you can't hide, Ishmael.
Who says no whale is an island?
When I prayed not to die of thirst and starvation, I should have been more specific.
I need more space.
And don't ever call me a blowhard again!!
Say, "Uncle".
Of all the islands in all the oceans in the world I had to breach this one.
I guess you're right. Whales can't climb trees.
Didn't I say, no man is an island?
I think we're going to need a bigger island.
I'm Jessica, your Uber driver.
High tide should be coming soon.
So should we talk about the elephant in the room?
Birds fly over the rainbow; why, then, oh why can't I?
Next year I choose the vacation.
Maybe this will stop those stupid desert island cartoons.
I thought I saw a spider.
There just has to be more to this whole island hopping thing.
Man, I hate low tides.
Somebody should have told you that whales respond to whistling.
But why do I need to turn my head and cough?
Take it back, Jonah.
Google maps.
You called me, Ishmael? ... Ishmael!?
"Who you gonna tell?
Were you playing Pokemon Go too?
Sorry mate, but I couldn't hear another refrain of '99 Bottles...'
Can you put some lotion on my back?
I guess 'endangered' is a relative phenomenon......
The great thing about talking to you is you don't interrupt
Promise not to scream if I get off of you?
I told him 20 times, stop calling me Moby Dickhead.
Morning Harry. How'd you sleep? Harry?
This concludes our NPR podcast.
Hate to be a bother, but would you mind terribly pushing me back out to sea?
I'm a cuddler, not a killer
Where there's a whale, there's a way
I said SNAIL mail
That's it! Right there.
When Pokémon Go goes horribly wrong.
I really need to update my GPS.
Damn speed bumps!
This island ain't big enough for the both of us .....
Oh, man, what did I drink last night?
Push.
Now scratch a half meter to my right.
I'm not getting in the water in RIO.
Sorry, I was sure I could pull off the "Free Willy" jump.
Sorry...I've been watching the Olympics and I thought I could make the jump.
OUCH! Landed right on my coconuts!
Thar she ...
It might be better if I rode on your back.
first of all get off me,and secondly your fear of the ocean is not healthy for either of us.
I really hate GPS.
So how's my prostate, doc?
Oh, boy! Beachfront property with snacks!
Is this really the time to bring up my weight problem?
"Sorry about that; it looked so easy when Shamu did it.
Aaaah, yes, right there. That’s the out-of-reach spot.
...and then I'd land on the platform like this and they'd give me a fish. You got any fish?
Epilogue: Moby Dick gets Herman Melville.
Marco? Now you say "polo." Tim? Tim?
This hurts me more than it hurts you.
That's it, I'm done playing Pokemon Go.
I don't know about you, but I'm beached.
If we are going to continue to live together, we're going to have to learn to compromise.
I dropped by to thank you for your recent donation to Greenpeace's 'Save the Whales' campaign. Every gift makes a difference.
Why you should never use more than 10 pound test fishing line.
Well, your mating call worked.
Of all the palm trees on all the deserted islands in all the world, she lands on mine.
Stop, that tickles!
I wish you would call before dropping in.
I'm gonna need a bigger beach.
You want me to change the oil too while I'm under here?
I don't mean to pile on, but life isn't all krill and squid for me either.
Thus endeth the Beach Boys.
Down & to the right...ooh, that's it!
Is it high tide yet?
I like your company, but it's smothering me.
Wait, did you mean the side of the island on my left or yours?
You're wasting your time searching for my G-spot. I'm a sperm whale.
I got your letter.
Now will you believe in climate change?
'Shark Week' totally freaks me out.
The last climate change denier.
Ooommpph. This speed bump wasn't here yesterday.
Sorry, this was my first beaching
You called me, Ishmael!
Not until you say 'uncle', Ahab
You can run, but you can't hide, Jonah.
I tried to tell you this island wasn't big enough for the two of us.
No man is an island entire of itself
Did someone call Uber?
Now the Lord had prepared a great fish to smoosh Jonah.
Hey, this sucks for me too.
The end for the wicked witch of the South Pacific.
Pokémon GO. And you?
WHEN YOU WISH FOR FEMALE COMPANIONSHIP ..... YOU HAVE TO BE MORE SPECIFIC.
Scratch a little more to the left.
A little further to the left.
Oh great. Now what am I going to do for shade?
Low tide's a beach.
I hope I'm not a burden.
I never should have told the genie that I felt like a beached whale ...
They'll never know you finally got me.
"RECALCULATING ROUTE, RECALCULATING..." -Shut up already!
Lucky for you, I heard you call for help!
I see how you got your last name, Moby.
I told you - enough with the sperm jokes!
Jonah considers his options.
I assume you're Ishmael.
"Oh, I'm smothering you? Well now you know how your mother makes me feel"!
Why your "desert island" album list should NOT include whale songs
You can row, Ahab, but you can't hide...
Sorry. I thought I could make it.
No man is an island -- especially not this man.
I always wondered how it would feel to be between a whale and a hard place.
Ahhh. More to the right.
I have to stop playing Pokemon Go.
Ha! More like "SQUISH-mael!"
Don't worry. I'm vegetarian!
I heard your distress call. You okay?
My one item on a deserted island would be a forklift.
When biblical tales go horribly wrong...
Timeshare's up!
I told you it was too soon for us to move in together.
Moby Dick meets Robinson Crusoe.
This is even worse than jumping the shark.
You have to laugh at the low probability of me beaching myself
I saw your note in a bottle.
Sorry! I'm such a Dick.
This is payback for WaterWorld.
What? You never heard of a lapwhale?
Roger redefines "having a whale of a time."
Whale 1 - Castaway - 0
Are you aware that cuddling kills depression, relieves anxiety and strengthens the immune system?
What would Tom Hanks do?
This island makes me feel fat.
While you're there, could you change the oil?
Okay, next time I get to be the Wicked Witch and you get to be the house.
So much for Meet Jewish Singles.
What do you mean ocupado?
Yes, right there, that's the spot, scratch.
I found your message in a bottle. You need help?
Stop squirming, it tickles.
The note in the bottle said "Please drop by soon".
Still 'Hungry enough to eat a whale,' smart guy?
8...9…10… PIN!
Yep, I definitely need glasses.
For some reason I thought becoming a land mammal would be a lot harder.
Uber for Dan?
Come on, you're not even trying. Push harder.
The real ending to The Old Man and the Sea.
Do you mind? You're blocking the sun!
You said you wanted more shade.
Please stop tickling me.
Don't worry, I've got you covered.
Sorry! My Mom TOLD me "don't swim and text!"
I should've said "I'm so hungry I could eat a life-raft."
Suddenly, Eugene Krill's luck went from bad to worse.
It was funny the first time.....I'm not going to keep guessing who you are.
Casey regretted choosing Moby Dick as the one thing to bring with him to a desert island.
No man is an island, or something like that.
Sorry, pal. Sometimes life really IS a beach.
Sorry about that. I hear you're an endangered species too.
I knew the GPS was wrong
Well l don't like it any better than you do.
Sorry, about that. I thought you were waving a treat.
Oooh yes! thats the spot. Now scratch a little lower down.
Ahab, we're going to need a bigger island.
You've been served.
Oh no, not again.
Your shocks look fine...I don't know what the problem is.
Was that good for you too?
There once was a man in Nantuckett...
Almost there. Scratch a little lower.
You're right. I'll take the bottom bunk next time.
Sorry. I got distracted playing Pokemon Go.
I'm afraid I can't see you any more.
I'm sorry. Were you here first?
Best two out of three?
Uber arriving for Jonah!
A perfect 10! Stuck that landing!
Did I clear the tree?
Of all the islands in all the oceans in all the world, she plops onto mine.
And then she left me for a real blow-hard.
Just received your S.O.S. How can I be of service?
It looked so easy in Free Willy.
But, AirBnBeached.com confirmed my reservation months ago.
Call me Fish Meal.
Would you call this beached or marooned?
I shall hug him and kiss him and smother him with love, and I shall call him George.
Inside, Jonah ... inside!
Scratch a little to the left... down a bit... ahhh, that's the spot!
So sorry! My navigation system clearly indicated this was a "deserted rest stop".
Wait, did you say "breach" or "beach?" Because I did both...
I came as soon as I got your message!
Get...off...my...beach
Does this seem awkward to you?
It's because you never called me, Ishmael.
Uncle! I said UNCLE!!
I am a mammal. It is time to stop living a lie.
A little to the left.
Look, Ahab, you have been chasing me for an eternity, right? So I gave in and you still complain!
You looked taller in your profile picture.
Willy made it look so easy
Could you check the oil while you're down there?
Fine, I get it. You don't have to call me Ishmael.
Did you call for help?
Mr. Attenborough, I'm a huge fan!
Sorry, I would have cleared the island in my SeaWorld days.
Sperm whale ejaculates seaman on Isle of Man!
Didn't you work at Sea World?
Not again!
You look different than your profile picture.
Would it help if I sing?
Maybe playing 'Twister' wasn't the best way to pass the time.
The unwritten ending of Moby Dick
It was either this or Mar-a-Lago.
Sorry. I've been drinking all day.
Didn't you know that yelling 'Thar she blows!' was offensive?
You look different than your Facebook photo.
Life's a beach and then...
Botched reenactment of an Old Testament story.
OK, I'm good now. You?
Why would you wish for a whale?
Of all the sandbars in all the oceans in all the world, she flops into mine.
Does this island have wifi? My sonar is clearly broken.
Thank You for donating to "Save The Whales".
Could you give me a little push, here.
"This is for my harpooned ancestors, pal.
Simply proving that no man is an island.
Some odds, eh?
Jonah, you OK?
You're no Jonah.
He's the 7th. stunt man we've used for this scene.
Degree of difficulty? Who cares? I crushed it!
If you meant the book, you should have said, "the book."
Of all the palm trees on all the isles in all the world, she flops onto mine.
We've reached the moment when I throw you back.
Larry first attempt at whale watching was momentarily successful.
I'm Jonah! You're supposed to swallow me, not crush me.
Well, the jump had a high degree of difficulty. My execution, however, could have been better.
Bad luck comes in threes. One more to go.
You can call me Mr. Dick.
The GOP in 2016 (metaphorically speaking).
Death's a beach, as well.
It's funny, they also make me buy two seats on the plane.
George regretted his desperate wish for company, any company........
SAFE on Third!!!
You would have seen me coming if you hadn't been texting...
Who ordered the fish?
Can I go back to the unbearable weight of loneliness?
I said a hammock couldn’t take both of us.
No, a little to the left. Ahh, that's better.
On second thought, I'd rather be marooned alone.
And then she says, ‘I don’t love you anymore,’ so I decided to beach myself.
Yea, right there, scratch a little harder. Ahhhh.
OK, OK, Uncle!
Contrary to popular lore, Jonah tried several alternatives before deciding to take up residence in the whale.
So that's a Moby Dick!
John simply could not catch a break.
Stupid whale song ringtone.
Does this island make me look like a beached whale?
Sorry. That was a breach of etiquette.
I am seeking political asylum. Those Japanese are going to kill me.
With all the islands in all the oceans, you had to beach yourself here?!
Told'ya I was a killer whale!
I'm trying to keep kosher, and I assumed, a name like Jonah..
Yeah, I see the problem, you need a new driveshaft.
I'm sorry Dave, I really thought I could make it.
My bad. I thought I could make it over the tree.
I thought you were going to catch me.
A little to the left...a little more...ahh yes, right there!
"You've got whale!
You're sleeping on my half - move over!
Hey, relax, things like this make news.
Thar she blo . . .
Look, we're going to have to work together if we're going to get off this thing.
Hey, at least you're not getting a sun burn.
I'm with the search party.
Sorry! You know White whales can't jump.
This is the way the world ends Not with a bang but an hors d'oeuvre.
I can't swim...
My bad, this used to be Newfoundland before global warming.
You're hogging the shade.
Ok, now get my back.
Dick.
Lower -- and a little to the left, please.
A little to the left, a little higher - it's driving me nuts!
My horoscope did say I'd find a mysterious man on an exotic island.
No worries! I've got your back.
Possession is nine tenths of the law.
oh fuck
I guess we should have gone to my place.
Sorry, but this island isn't big enough for both of us.
no worries, I've got you covered
Excuse me. I was playing Pokemon Go.
Alright, already. I said, 'I give.'
You can call me Wilson.
Well, blow me over!
Ready to say uncle yet, Crusoe?
I heard your cry for help.
I heard you call for help.
paradise lost
Ooh, that's good...now, just a little to the left.
That's for Shamu.
When you waved, I thought you were inviting me over.
Maybe if you just hold the reward out to your side next time
Needs salt.
Just my luck. A lifetime supply of whale oil and no lamp to use it in.
This ... isn't ... how ... brochure ... described ... island ... hopping.
I don't understand, I carried you on my back for miles.
No whale is an island, damn it!
Nobody gets away, Ish, nobody.
Global warming, am I right?
The ONE time I try to 'jump the shark'.
Marco? ... Marco?
I don't like being stranded either.
I still don't understand why you picked me as one of your three items
Can you scooch just a bit to your left? YOUR left.
Sorry, I really thought I could make it over this.
It used to just be Moby... But, um... well, I keep doing stuff like this.
I don't understand. I trained with Dr. Heimlich himself.
Oh good...just us mammals.
In my mind, I was going to sail right over it.
He's stuck between an orca and a hard place.
I promised to always breach across the isle.
My name was Ishmael.
I know why the beached whale sings
Against all odds two lonely souls find each other
And the Lord caused a great fish to swallow up Jonah; which did not work precisely as the Lord had planned.
That feels great! Now, scratch a little higher and to the left, under the fin.
I can't control my blubbering.
shit man, my bad
Shamu made it look so easy.
To be fair, though, you were supposed to be watching for whales.
Sorry! I'm hungry and I thought you said "KELP"!
This island isn't big enough for two of us
At least you're not lonely anymore.
I said a little company would be nice.
Oh, thank God! Someone to talk to!
I must be getting older...I used to be able to jump this island with ease!
I'm a cuddler
. . . and to complicate matters, my feet are getting sunburned . . .
I'm a lap whale.
Call me crazy, but I thought this was what you wanted.
Wilson?
Consider yourself saved.
He's Not Heavy. He's My Brother.
Everest, 2046
What? I can't hear you….
Of all the islands in the world...
What? I'm big boned!
Oil change?
That was fantastic! Was it as good for you?
I told you a lap dance was a bad idea.
I have a whalegram for a Mr. Ishmael..
Wow! I'm a tree hugger, too!
Hold still and I'll have this tooth filled in no time.
Look, I don't like this anymore than you do.
That's it for me with island hopping.
I'm a palm reader. Yours has a short life-line.
OKRA NOT ORCA!!
Just my luck. I beached myself on a totally deserted island.
Next time you'll be more careful when you wish for sun block.
Ahab! You never write, you never call.
You mean sperm whales can't celebrate Hump Day?
I am so glad I found your message in the bottle. I've been sooooo lonely too.
Don't be a dick Moby get off of me.
I...I think I saw a shark.
Who's a dick NOW?!
Sorry, you just looked so much like Ahab.
I found your message and swam over as quickly as I could.
My name isn't Ahab.
It's okay, I know CPR.
Gotcha, Ishmael. Game over.
You said "Drop in any time."
Just an oil change, please
Well, thanks a lot for praying you wouldn't die alone.
Sorry, is this beach taken?
Sorry, but when you get beached on a tiny island, stuff happens.
Of all the islands in all the oceans in all the world, she lands on mine.
I'm glad you adopted me as a baby but I think it's time I left home.
Come on Mobey!!!! Don't be a dick.
Perhaps he should have chosen more carefully when answering the age old question, "What one book would you bring if marooned on a desert island for the rest of your life?"
Of all the deserted islands in all the oceans in all the world, she washes up on mine.
At least I'm more interesting to talk to than a volleyball.
I never should have yelled, "Here boy!"
Wow, the audiobook really makes the story come alive.
I'm beached. YOU'RE supposed to be helping ME.
Was it good for you?
Of all the islands in all the seas in all of the world...
It's not great for me either.
All's well that ends whale.
Sorry, the "pod"cast said this was a deserted island.
Cannnnnonballlll!
that's the spot - keep scratching just there!
Excuse me sir. I saw the listing first.
Well, pardon me for spawning.
At the count of 3, you lift and I'll start pushing with my tail.
I have to say, I expected more of a squishing sound.
You mean your name is NOT Ahab?
Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse...
This Pokemon Go app is questionable at best.
Are you my mother?
I don't care that you were here first.
Who says I can't have a crush on a man?
I'm pretty sure I can make it all the way across next time if you hold the hoop a little higher.
Don't worry, I only eat plankton.
Easy bro, we're all mammals here.
Sorry... It's Shark Week.
White whale privilege.
As "Free Willie" aged, his leaping suffered.
Sorry, Siri said to make a slight right turn.
Could you get my back too?
Hey, buddy. I'm stuck. Could you push me back into the water?
Moby Dick being a dick
I come in for just a fin rotation you guys always find something else wrong...
Ahab? I'm home!
Just a myth, huh?
Bob, I just want you to know that you're my best friend... Bob?...
Of course, now I see it's a tree, but let's be honest here, it looked like you were spouting right at me.
Hey look, a ship!
Now do you believe me? No man is an island.
Never teach a whale to play fetch.
I know I'm a whale! What's your point?
#whalefail
I always come on too strong!
Of all the beaches on all the islands in all the world, she flops onto mine.
Sorry ... Global Warming
Hand me the wrench
Did you call Uber?
Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, she swims into mine.
I'm happy to see you too, Moby, but don't overdo it.
Let me know when you're ready to take a selfie.
I just couldn't take another minute of your singing '... a three hour tour'!
Because I can. Why are you here?
Ok, that's good, now just a little to the right...
I should've just befriended a volleyball.
I warned you about playing that same CD again.
You do a great whale call.
That's pretty much how they do it at Sea World, I think.
A 25000' dive without a parachute and I land here!
Perhaps a dolphin would be a better pet.
I swear I saw a shark fin.
I am looking for an agent. I have this idea for the great American novel.
Sorry, Ahab, you can run, but you can't hide!
Maybe being a lap whale isn't such a good idea...
Hey down there, do you know the words to "Don't Worry, Be Happy?
Okay, wiseguy, who's a Moby Dick now?
You're going to need a bigger cracker.
When I said I wanted to bring Moby Dick to my desert island, I didn't mean it literally.
You? How do you think I feel-it looked way bigger online.
Migrating is so exhausting.
Who said,"no man is an island"?
Could you swim 10,000 miles without a break?
Do you ever wish you could just get out from under all the pressure?
That's for Tilikum and Shamu!
Just be still, almost done with the root canal.
Yo Ahab! Tag! You're it.
A little more to the left
Take THIS story back to your publisher!
Sorry, Willy made it look easy.
SeaWorld said they only wanted killer whales.
Island food doesn't always agree with me.
Amazon delivery! Here's the copy you ordered of Moby Dick.
Dear Diary...Day 1. Call me Ish...
Ishmael? Is that you?
Gotcha, Pokémon Crusoe !
I got your note in a bottlel
How about this for whale watching?
Looking for love in all the wrong places.
when I said my 'one thing' would be Moby Dick I meant a copy of the book
Wrong bait.
Did you find any Pokemon here?
turn me over, im done on this side.
Please don't tell the rest of my pod.
It was thundering and lightning! I had to get out of the water!
You know this island makes you look fat, right?
And to think I moved here to escape the crushing weight of my middle-class responsibilities.
Sorry, I thought your island was a female whale.
Nailed It!!!
Well it was YOUR idea to play Marco Polo......
What are the odds? You won the lotto, got ship wrecked, and now this.
If you can't be with the one you love, love the one you're with.
What a fluke this is!
I swear something just touched me in the water!
Tag!
Do you want to be on top instead?
' It's Global warming, if the water rises abit i'll be on my way.'
Gotcha Ishmael.
A little to the left...ahhh, that's the ticket.
Sorry dear. The island looked so much bigger on Airbnb.
Sorry about Wilson.
Unfortunately the whale had a crush on Jonah
Oh wow ... Like, I was really drunk last night, so whatever happened after the ... Hello? ...
I thought I ordered the shrimp
I must say, the garnish is a very nice touch.
At least I no longer need sunscreen.
Is this helping? This isnt helping, is it?
I came to save you.
Whale, I didn't see that coming.
Well I wouldn't have wished for this either.
This is why I can't have nice things.
I hope that guy wasn't a marine biologist.
Promise you'll never leave me!
Just my luck! A beached human.
Sorry. You looked like you needed a hug.
He ain't heavy, he's my Whale.
Um. Could you give me a little push.
I don't want to go back to Orlando!
Well, you've been whining about having no company...
My cousin at Sea World says he gets a fish treat after each jump.
I thanked God for saving me and just asked for more shade.
LOOK, IT'S A--- Mmmmmmmphhh!
Long time no sea...Ishmael.
Sorry. When you gotta beach, you gotta beach.
Oh I feel like such a klutz.
For an extra fifty bucks I can change out the filter too.
Believe it or not, I'm insured for this.
{Moby Dick Epilogue} And the great whale, overcome with guilt, failed miserably in a final act of contrition.
Shark for Pete's sake, it's jump the SHARK
Who looks like a beached whale now, huh?
Just like old times, eh, Ahab?
I should have looked before I breached.
Let's just sing duets. The dance routine isn't working.
You didn't upgrade to Windows 10. I'm here to inquire why.
With global warming, I'll be covered in water again in no time.
I'm so sorry. From a distance your island resembled a sperm whale I dated near the Azore's.
I knew I'd find you someday, Ishmael!
I told you no Moby Dick jokes.
Relax! I have you covered.
What kind of name is Ishmael, anyway?
Relax, I'm certified in C.P.R.
Hmm, I swear I saw somebody waving!
Call me Smooshmael.
Are you beached, too?
I saw a shark!
You win, I can't do the "Free Willy" jump.
Thank you for letting me vent.
And stop calling me Ishmael!
Sorry, you looked like my trainer from Sea World.
Finally—No Man is an Island.
Ok, that's good....now just behind my left ear.
I think I caught something.
These speed bumps are killing me!
It’s Moby Richard you annoying little twit.
Man, I got some bad krill.
I know you're having trouble breathing. Think how I feel!
Sadly, Moby's attempt to show affection, failed again.
You also bought into this tropical retreat timeshare?
That's the last time I'll have to hear 'thar she blows'!
Hey, I'm a tree-hugger, too!
Call me Ish.
Jonah, your Uber driver is here.
Of all the islands, in all the oceans, in all the world, I flop onto yours.
I just think we need space.
Scratch a little to the left, please.
This Island is not big enought for the two of us.
And me without any tartar sauce.
Why won't you hump back?
My apologies...but I've decided to evolve, and I'm on a very tight schedule.
You were wishing for a big cold ale?
Sometimes you just feel a relationship isn't working out.
Careful -- there's a shark out there!
I found him!
You're such a good listener.
I thought you said you just needed a hug.
With all the islands, in all the oceans, you had to beach on mine.
Sorry about that. It looked easy when Willy did it.
Looks Like your leaking oil.
Nobody calls me a Dick.
It looked a lot easier when Willy did it.
Nice to meet you, Ishmael. Call me Dick.
Why whale speed bumps don't work.
Oh Ahab, how I've missed you.
Son of a Beach!
I have no freakin idea what the password is!
Note to self: When ordering seafood, never use the drop shipping option.
I could have sworn I left him here...
Sorry, Jonah. But one man's beach is another man's breach.
Sorry, you looked like Ishmael.
So, you are lost too?
I'm a little less surprised than you.
I ordered pizza!
Sorry dude - Pokemon Go again.
My fear of water trumps your social anxiety.
Moby, don't be a dick; I can't breathe.
Sorry... I thought I saw a shark.
I've never been very good at parking.
I warned you, but you just HAD to crack one more "blowhole" joke, didn't you?
Oh my god! I've killed Kevin Costner!
Of all of the beaches in all of the seas in all of the world she beaches onto mine.
Just stick the message into the bottle and don't worry about how you spelled Cetacea.
The good news is your whale calls from 'Finding Nemo' are spot-on.
Melville decided to cut the chapter showing Moby's playful side.
Now you're really being a dick.
I land. Get it?
Breathe through your blow-hole.
Oh no! Just when I thought he was about to vote me off the island!
So Noah, here's the deal.
Hey, you're the one who wanted to play Twister!
Call me Ishwhale.
Enough with the overwrought symbolisn already.Sometimes you just just get smashed by a white whale
It's called 'eminent domain.' I learned about it from Donald Trump.
So that was a tsunami.
...sorry, I was chasing a Pokemon
You looked like you could use some company.
Hmm...Willy made it seem so easy.
Those sharks on Waterbnb must have double-booked us.
Missed it by that much.
Well, here's another fine mess you've gotten me into, Ahab.
I said, on 'THREE'!
Kansas, 2084
But everyone needs a hug once in a while.
I'm an endangered species. If you have a complaint, take it up with the World Wildlife organization.
I didn't see your name on it.
Remember SeaWorld!
Talk about being unlucky, I get beached out here in the middle of nowhere.
Uncle. Uncle!
Sorry about the palm tree, man. I was texting my cetologist.
I'm not happy about this situation either.
Whale hello there.
I feel like the princess on a pea.
I can't get off. I've beached.
I thought I saw a shark.
Don't worry, they'll never find you.
This is awkward, but I rented the island thru my travel agent last year.
Anyone seen Ishmael?
Oops.......my GPS needs an update
What do you mean I have a little something on my chin?
Don't you ever have days when you just need a hug?
Trust me, you'll feel differently about this arrangement at low tide.
You mean Ish-meal.
Sorry! I did catch the Pokemon though, if it's of any consolation.
One of us has to go.
Maybe you should go on top.
We are just going to have to learn to share.
Mamma told me not to swim and Pokémon Go.
What do you mean, you need some space?
This is my first time breaching.
I put on a few pounds after leaving Sea World.
Hey, take a load off!
Well, you DID say you didn't want to spend the rest of your life talking to a volleyball
How Moby got his last name.
Dang, something tickles.
What sort of Uber driver were you expecting in this neighborhood?
My first wish is to be stranded on a tropical island with a shapely female . . .
The whale in the movie made that jump look so easy.
Death's a beach.
You looked taller in your profile pic.
I wonder where Jonah went.
Ahab?
SPF 2384
Ishmael, it's Moby!
There, there -- you're not alone. I'm your friend.
So quiet today. Something weighing on your mind?
It looked so easy when Flipper made the jump.
I thought it said *deserted* island.
So this is what it's like to whale on somebody.
Is that you Jonah?
You'll thank me for this when Greenpeace arrives.
Captain Ahab, I presume.
Yeah, I'm gonna have to call you back, you're cutting out.
Ok, ok, I'm no Michael Phelps.
Robinson Crusoe meets Moby Dick.
Excuse me, this island is supposed to be deserted.
Sorry about that - do you think you could help roll me back in?
Free Billy!
Maybe next time you’ll remember not to call us fish.
You have no idea how lonely I've been
Moby sent me.
Flip over, you're snoring again.
I just can't quit you, Ahab.
Who's the mammal now Gary?
Sorry! I see now you have both legs.
When the opportunity finally came, he let nothing stand in the way of his lifelong ambition to be the Big Fish on the small island.
Thanks, just needed a break. Water's killing me.
Don't be silly Jonah, I'm a vegetarian...
Moby, you're being a real dick right now.
What a fluke, huh buddy?
Krill me now.
Mama always said, "Look before you breach!"
Sorry, my bad, I was texting while diving...
Sorry, I just got tired of all the swimming.
So much for Match.com!
Stay tuned to see if tickling works!
I said no more desert island cartoons!
That's when pressure to get off the island really increased
Just the oil change, or are we rotating the fins today too?
Maybe you should try the trust fall on me instead.
You've never heard of a lap whale?
Guess I should've taken the bottom bunk.
" I need my space. I need my space. " All you ever do is whine.
I'm your Uber diver, Moby.
Need a push here.
That'll teach him to crap in the ocean.
This is not the way it was supposed to end, Jonah.
And, you think you're having a bad day?!
Dick was my uncle. I'm Moby Douche.
Look, could you make this quick? I've got a boat to ram.
Looks like you're overdue for this oil change.
I know we're both mammals but come on.
Good boy, good boy - now please get off my lap.
"Marco" "Polo ' '
I don't think this relationship is going to work out.
Having a whale of a time! Wish you were here.
If elected, I'll continue to reach across the isle.
You're right Joe; the leaves at the top are the most tender. Joe?...
What would Queequeg do?
Awww man. This didn't happen in Free Willy.
I said breach, not beach.
Do you want the coconut, or not?
Sorry. If I were a dolphin, I'd have made it.
Survivor: Climate Change Edition
Sorry, I didn't catch that.
This South Beach diet is brutal
This is not what I meant by supporting wildlife.
My parents told me to get out more.
Deep within all this blubber is a lapdog yearning to be free.
Sorry, my migration app isn't working.
I'm lonely too you know...
Well, this is rather flukish on several levels.
Plus, the whale watching is fantastic here.
Anyone here order an Uber?
So is anyone gonna help me back in?
Sorry, I just had to rest after island hopping all week.
Darn, another breaching accident. My insurance premiums will go through the roof.
You would think the high jump would be just a bit easier in deeper water!
Sorry, I thought you said "Squishmael."
My lawyer is calling it 'death by echolocation.'
Of all the . . . Ahab, is that you?!?
Do you mind? You're in my sun.
No big deal--your ambergris is about 12,000 gallons low. I'll have you out of here in a jiffy.
Sorry. I saw a jellyfish.
Ishmael, Shishmael. Call yourself what you want, but this should put a stop to your endless yarns.
Note to pod: Put not your faith into echoes and sonar!
Crusoe's hopes for rescue are flattened
Well it's not how I planned to spend my vacation either
Maybe no man is an island…
No whale is an island.
On the plus side, I'm not a humpback.
An inconvenient truth.
I guess I owe you ten bucks; I was sure I could clear it.
"Let's have a sleepover!" You said. ""It'll be fun!" You said.
I miss Gary Larson.
I get the feeling you're not going to call me in the city.
We both seem to be having a bad day.
I'm the cautionary whale.
Yes, I am humping your back... hence the name!
You looked cold.
Island hopping gone awry.
#Dear Mom, having a whale of a time!
Hey buddy, could you give me a push?
You were supposed to catch me.
So you deny using unlicensed whale songs for your ringtone?
I thought you were lonely.
This is not the sun block I ordered.
Maybe you should have swum out to me.
Maybe it's just me, but I don't see this relationship working for many reasons.
On the plus side, you're safe from hearing election news
Sorry, when you yelled beach I heard breech...
No whale is an ocean..how about that one buddy.
Once upon a desert isle... The End.
The basic problem with a Moby Dick reunion.
John prayed for fresh fish.
I should have wished for fish and chips instead.
You'll have to go to the mainland to have that checked out.
Up... Up more... A little left... There! AAAHHH...
You did say "Drop in anytime".
Are you calling me fat ? I'm on an all plankton diet !
It's not MY fault. Miami had a much bigger beach before global warming.
If it's any consolation, things didn't start well for Jonah, either.
See? I TOLD you you couldn't lift me! But did you listen? Nooooooooo!
What a Moby Dick I am.
Is anyone here a marine biologist?
Hi! I'm Needy Dick.
Call Spielberg.
We need to pick a better game than Leapfrog.
I find your "beached whale" references to be very hurtful...
Bert didn't want to die wondering whether or not he could benchpress a whale.
I ordered fish and chips to be delivered by drone, but this is ridiculous.
I'll let you up if you can explain how Trump got the Republican nomination.
Got krill?
You ever just want to get away from it all?
Well, it looked like a mating dance to me.
I just love to cuddle.
Enough already, Ahab. I surrender.
Life's a beach, ain't it, Ahab?
I'm Terry Gross with Fresh Air
I'm sorry, but it was worth it for the rare Pokemon.
You think you're stuck?
*Sigh* Another whaled beach.
I guess Moby really is a dick.
It's not your fault, we both thought the palm tree was a good idea.
OK, I just need a little more height to stick the landing.
Hey buddy, I told you no man is an island unto himself.
Just as Captain Ahab considered his good fortune on finding a deserted isle ....
Hemingway's second best ending for The Old Man and the Sea.
Or maybe, Mr. Phelps, you could stay out of the water when I swim.
Just then, Harold realized that "perfect beach weather" didn't mean the same thing to everyone.
This is smaller than my old place.
Sorry, bro, but I'm totally playing the endangered species card here.
What do you mean, you feel like I'm smothering you?
Mom always warned my to look before I breach!
since sea world let me go I've missed you guys so,...
Oops! A speed bump.
I thought Hawaii was going to be bigger...
I hate when the food gets stuck and then the toothpick breaks trying to get it out.
I warned you I hate the Gilligan's Island song.
But you're insured, right?
Well Ahab, this is a strange ending isn't it.
I hope I'm not the last one voted off the island.
I might not have been the best choice for the one thing you'd bring with you to a deserted island.
Could you maybe sun yourself somewhere else? This spot is already taken.
Sorry. I have a fear of jellyfish.
Sorry Jonah, he says you have to get back in.
I'm sure we could have worked out a more mutually beneficial arrangement.
Tag, you're it!
I thought it was just another speed bump.
I'm not good at this whole whale-watching thing.
Are you sure you want your tattoo here?
Continuing to shout "beached whale" will only offend me.
Sorry. Birds gotta fly, Fish gotta swim, Humpbacks gotta...
OK, "Ishmael" it is.
Now you know why the call me Moby Dick.
Oops, sorry Waldo my bad.
Nice to visit, but I couldn't live here.
Sorry my GPS said turn right
Sometimes I wish that I could be the little spoon.
This is the last time I'm going Economy class on a Whale watcher's Cruise
I heard there were pokemon?
Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world....
Jonah, is that you?
Wasn't pretty but still olympic bronze for that landing.
Point well taken, but how do you think I feel being beached on the only speck of land in thousands of square miles of ocean expanse?
Cloudy with a chance of whale.
Oh, you're not Jonah?
I really should look before I breach.
Once a Dick, always a Dick.
The book! I meant the Moby Dick the book!
Opps, sorry ........ thought you were the Pequod
I'll be out of your hair in a minute.
I thought you said we'd do the lift after the first chorus.
And you thought you had bad luck before.
This place is not big enough for the both of us.
His life was meaningless, but at least he died with a porpoise.
Scratch a little bit to my right.
I thought this man was an island.
Too close?
And to think they tried to tell me I'm not a killer whale!
OK, I guess no whale is an island either.
Whoever did your pedicure is amazing.
i think we're through Ahab
It was a chance meeting, a brief encounter and a failed cross species affair that doomed them both.
Room for one more?
Sorry, Ishmael.
Sorry, I have hydrophobia.
Don't worry l'il fella, I got you covered
I got your back.
"Well, now you know two squeaks and a grunt means "Dibs".
not so deserted anymore, Pal
Okay Todd, left foot on red. Todd?
I warned you about the constant whistling.
Jonah, I've been looking for you everywhere.
I'm home Honey!
Of all the islands in all of the oceans, you had to drop onto mine.
Oh my, you haven't been flossing!
Excuse me, I was looking for Maui.
Uh oh. Wrong cartoon.
Some travel agent. He said it would be nice and quiet on my own little island.
Your'e not Ahab! Never mind.
Could you scratch a little more to the left?
You know, Ahab, I'm not having a whale of a time either.
Protein and vegetation, just what the doctor ordered.
Gesundheit!
Desert island for you. Dessert island for me!
There goes another whale watcher!
Sorry, I was just trying out that new Auto-Pilot app.
Gotcha! Ahab.
Why does it always have to be about YOU?! How about "Save the WHALES?
The note in the bottle said you were having a whale of a good time.
I got your message
I'll keep you company.
Hey, my blowhole is on top!
How 'bout a tummy rub?
Jonah, did God say "in" or "on"?
Flipper could have cleared it with no problem!
Oops, sorry about that. I thought you were Ahab.
The reality show, "I am in Love with a Whale", did not end well.
That was close. I almost drowned.
Listen, I was here first.
I thought you could use a little company.
Damn you white male!
SURF & TURF
You requested an UBER, didn't you?
Well, it's painful to me to be called a fish.
Okay, we'll call it a draw.
This was not the "rescue" I'd been hoping for...
It was my turn to be on top.
Well ......they promised the whale watching would be mind blowing.
Try lifting more to the left.
The last thing on Trevor's mind was a beached whale.
Does this human make me look beached?
I thought climate change was a myth.
Great to find a toothpick when you have something stuck between your teeth.
Fella, I have no fuckin' idea why we beach ourselves like this.
We should have stayed with just the fist bump.
Trust me, PETA will find me faster than any helicopter will see your "Help Me" scrawl.
Looks like it's just the two of us.
Did I mention the whale on the island?
You are no longer Ishmael.
I know it was you,Fredo
You haven't been flossing.
I got your message in a bottle. I'm lonely too.
be careful what you wish for, he found out, as he landed the big one.
Save the whales?
I said "Do you think there's room for both of us?"
I love you, too, but please get off my lap!
When was the last time you washed your feet? They smell like dead fish.
I could have sworn this island was inhabited.
Sorry. It was a Dick move. My bad.
You see, I have this dreadful fear of the water."
I told you it would never work out.
Spam mail? I thought you clicked Sperm Whale.
Ugh! Last time I use live bait.
OK, now that we got him what do we do with him.
"Whalenado". It's even bigger than "Sharknado"!
Damn it Donald! I told you global warming wasn't a hoax!
Sorry, mate, the sign said "Beach."
I should have used smaller bait!
At least I didn't krill you.
Look, life's not a beach for me either.
If you survive this, I died fighting off whalers, okay?
My mistake! I thought the map said dessert island!
You've got to floss way back here.
Roomie, I thought you said single white male.
Sorry dude, but I told my friends if you sang Funky Town one more time I'd put an end to it.
Your muffler looks good, but your gonna need an oil change!
Could you scoot over just a tad?
Hey, I stuck that landing!
I'm with the Orca Rescue Team.
Just lie still until the ship passes. I'll hide you.
I needed a toothpick.
I think it is impacted
Okay, I promise never again to ask you to call me Ishmail.
I missed
I'm the only one left, too.
I told you a parrot was more appropriate.
Thank goodness, finally I've been rescued!
I loved you in 'Big.'
In hindsight, Greg realized he may have come on a little too strong.
Eeek! You saw a shark where!
A little lower, please. Yes, that's it, Ahhh
I said ON YOUR LEFT.
Island getaway whale ride included.
I wonder if travel insurance covers this
Sorry. I was looking for fish and ships.
Yeah, you were here first. So?
Guess you can't teach an old whale new tricks.
Ok, now you play Dorothy, and I'll be the good witch.
Sorry about this, but I'm afraid of sharks.
I didn't know he was a lap whale when I got him.
My mistake. I thought you were waving for me.
We are both washed up!
Uber?
My kingdom for a crane!
I guess it's time to finally install that GPS update.
Oh, face it. You didn't really have anything to look forward to, now did ya'?
I know we were keeping it a secret, Ishmael, but I just couldn't wait any longer.
My bad. I could have sworn you had a wooden leg.
I loe these small islands: a warm, juicy morsel and a tooth-pick
Note to self, never coax a whale, ' into jumping on your lap.'
I was hoping for something easier to prepare
When I asked you if I could crash here, I thought you knew what I meant!
You're much bigger than the Pokemon back home.
I swam, I soared, I conquered.
Beached, breeched... we're both in trouble.
I think what you meant to say was "mammal out of water."
Sorry Ishmael, but I can't let this little incident go viral.
Krill cologne always drives me crazy!
What are you, a Trumpback whale?
Do I have something stuck in my teeth?
I was told this Airbnb was unoccupied.
Funny, this krill tastes like chicken.
HELP, KELP, its an honest mistake.
Please Jonah, not here, right out in the open, in public!
Sorry, did I wake you?
Whales rule, dude.
I'll be all right. I just have to wait here for somebody to save me.
Does my snoring bother you?
God, I hate crush hour.
My coconuts!
'' BREACHING IS ALL FUN AND GAMES UNTIL SOMEONE GETS HURT !"'
Sorry, but that belly itch was killing me.
How many points for a palm tree and a castaway?
I sell term life policies, but it looks like I've caught you at a bad time.
It is high tide already; we need a plan B.
A little help
It doesn't look like it right now, but I'm sure we can work something out.
Sometimes Moby , you really live up to your name !
Man, Willy made it sound much easier...
I will love him and pet him and squeeze him and call him George
Finally, a little piece and quiet.
Hi! My name is Friday.
I worry there's been a breach of etiquette.
Sorry, I go a little crazy when somebody calls me Moby Dick.
C'mon, man. You're krillin' me.
I think we're the last gasp of climate change.
Making eye contact has always been awkward for me.
No man on my island.
So there must be two Prince of Wales islands
What a Dick.
My bad, I thought it was "No Man Is ON An Island."
Of all the rock piles in all the oceans in all the world, he washes up on mine.
The not so well-known effects of global warming.
I really wasn't that lonely!
So, God, where's this Jonah guy?
The sea was angry that day, my friends
Shall I call you ‘Ishmael’?
I like it when you're the big spoon.
So, you found the bottle?
Sorry, just taking a break while waiting for sea-level rise.
It's not too late to just have the salad.
Last whale on earth meets last man on earth.
Sorry pal, kind of a Moby Dick move on my part.
I'm not sure I get the appeal of island hopping.
Of all the beach joints in all the oceans, you flop in on mine.
This always happens when I blindly follow the sat-nav.
Worse than that, it's also spawning season.
"I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts.” Whale's note to self: Don't take Melville literally.
I told you we weren't ready for the lift from Dirty Dancing.
Before he began training the whale for the full-gainer with half-twist, Daryl unfortunately forgot to check the wind speed or direction. The catastrophe was immediate.

I'm glad to see you too, Moby. Now get off my back!
Move over . . . there's room enough for both of us!
I bit off more than I could chew.
I need to floss
It's so nice to finally have someone to tell my troubles to.
I meant the book.
Aw crap, beached again, did the Chinese put that island here?
Now scratch a little to the left
A little help, fella?
With everything we throw in the water these days, I don't blame you!
Be careful what you wish for, right?
I am covered for life!
EVIDENCE CONFIRMED: The Isle of One Man is no more.
You rest here, Jonah. Jonah?
I don't know about you but that workout crushed me.
I need some more alone time.
Be careful what you wish for, Jonah.
I wish for food and shelter, and this is the best you can do?!
Sorry, I thought you were traveling this weekend
I guess I'm afraid of commitment. And harpoons.
Take that, Ahab!
Looks like you're about 4 quarts of blubber low
Sorry, I didn't mean to whale on you. It's just my nature.
Behold: The whale's equivalent of stepping on a Lego.
I was waving at the ship! Not you ughhh....
It's the palm tree you can't see I'm worried about.
I'm sure I'm not in 'Sea World" anymore.
Yes I know you're here
Oh, boy! You're getting old for belly rubs.
This wasn't on Travelocity.
Uh, Jonah, it's the other way around.
"No man has an island to himself".
Since when has there been an island here?
You're breaking up. Is it me? Hello?
Live free and die.
Just scratch right there. Ahh, thanks Cap'n Ahab.
Let's just cuddle.
Due to the proliferation of misleading profile information it is suggested that first dates be in well trafficked public places.
Moby, you are a dickhead.
Your mom is an Ahab and my dad is Moby Dick but we can make it work.
Yes, I'm a Dick. Moby Dick.
Hello, did somebody call for a water taxi?
Do you have any sunscreen? I burn easily.
When I wished for a deluxe seafood dinner, this really wasn't what I had in mind.
Just try and 'save' me, wiseguy!
I just hate it when something gets stuck in my teeth.
Oh stop complaining. These islands are harder to spot since you caused the sea level rise.
No worries, bud. I’ve gone vegan.
As you said, "Life's a beach."
I'm not Ishmael, but you may call me whatever you'd like.
My long jump's not much, want to see my 400 meter freestyle?
I'm telling you I'm not Herman Melville!
Oh oh! Trouble in Paradise?
You're 3 fish late on your mortgage.
Aquaman, you might have been better off with some Prozac.
All I wanted was a hug.
Did someone say shark
Hello, Asian Gardens, that was a sushi order for one, not a ton.
Nowadays, we're really dependent on road krill.
You're awfully quiet dear. Is everything OK?
I told you it was better if you got on top...
Argh! This blows!
That's going to leave a kriller bruise...
"... Jonah?...JONAH?....Hey....JOOO-NAAAAAAH!?!?!...
Dang! Thought he had a peg leg.
I told you not to hog the shade.
We thank you for your patience and apologize for any inconvenience
I prayed for floating rubber, not floating blubber!
Tragedy strikes when released aquarium whale seeks human companionship
Aren't you glad to be off that ship, Ishmael?
Does anyone have a toothpick?
You can stop now. They said flossing isn't necessary anymore.
Just need to catch my breath...
For the last time, you are not, I repeat, NOT a lap-whale
Olly, Olly oxen free!
Pacific Life commercial, take one.
You should consider adding additional coverage to your homeowners policy.
I think you've overstayed your whalecome.
That must have been your whistling and not my mother's.
Jonah! Whatcha doing here, man?
Of all the gin joints, in all the world, she walks into mine
I'm really flattened by your attention.
Isn't it my turn to be on top?
What's that wailing sound?
I want to evolve
I don't suppose you could hand me my harpoon?
OK, now you scratch my back.
Could you just roll a bit to the left?
Bet you're glad i skipped the second helping of plankton this morning!
I told you, it's not "Moby Dick," it's Moby Richard.
I can't quit you, Jonah.
I didn't see that coming.
My fluke's asleep.
Oops, sorry. Your radio sounded like a mating call.
What's the catch?
This really isn't your week, is it?
This is how it feels to caption another island cartoon.
Ok. Next time you get to be the man.
MY NAME IS FRANKLIN AND I'M NOT PLANKTON. DO YOU MIND OPENING YOUR MOUTH?
DON'T call me RICHARD!
Oh, sorry, son, the brochure said it was uninhabited.
Your Craig's List ad said parking was included, but apparently not.
What does 'mmmummmbummummm' mean?
I just wish you were more talkative sometimes.
Sorry, Hamptons property was too expensive.
It was a nice visit, now roll me back in.
I'm kind of liking this whole AirB&B situation.
Allegorically speaking, this was not the ending Stan had anticipated.
"This is not your week".
Not my fault your desert-island companion wish was Moby.
The orca dared me to.
I told you that it's not big enough for the both of us.
Wait, are you trying to tell me you didn't request an Uber?
I admit it's a bit of a squeeze.
You're not Captain Ahab?
You know, Jonah, this routine is getting old.
Beached Whale Lives Matter!
I just asked for some sushi.
Where exactly is that thorn?
I was here first!
I'm glad I finally found a therapist.
I heard someone shouting my name....Wilson.
This is all I can afford since SeaWorld let me go.
Oops! Sorry. My GPS kept recalculating!
They don't call me Moby Dick for nothing!
Quit crying and get back out there.
Yeah, yeah, 'beached whale,' I get it.
My bad, I thought that you were Jonah
Okay, I’ll call you Ishmael. But I’m here to take you to the same place I took Captain Ahab.
Just to let you know, I'm NOT having a whale of a good time here!
Take a deep breath. 5 more minutes and we're done with your oil change.
Rub her tummy and Shamu would follow you anywhere!
Uggghhhh... call me Squishmael.
You looked like Pikachu from the water.
Look out little buddy, sharks!
Jonah! Where have you been?
Sorry, buddy, but life's a beach!
So you're the one that didn't get away.
Now you understand why they call me Moby Dick?
I don't care about the research. They've never flossed with a palm tree.
Sorry, Mr. Trump, but exiling you to a desert island just wasn't "hyuge" enough.
That concludes the exam. You owe me for a new palm tree.
Do I still get the herring?
I tried to tell him . . . an island economy just can't support an aquarium . . .
Jonah? Where are you, buddy?
That was close. At first I thought it was a Great White.
I think you are right, you should be the big spoon.
Hump Day in paradise
We're all killer whales
You just had to poke me with that pointy stick, didn't you?
Moby Dick finally reciprocated Ahab's unrequited love.
Tastes like chicken.
Homicide: Life on the Beach
Nobody likes hugs but me.
At least you're better off than Jonah.
Sorry, I thought this beach was bigger.
Maybe true love can't conquer all.
Ishmael, planted.
Uh... can we try this again tomorrow? I think I've almost got it.
It's Willy! I'm back!
Thank God you've come
I'll never let go, Jack. I promise.
Off, Moby! You aren't a lap-whale.
I land.
Do you mind dude? You're killing me.
Prove your body is taller than the tree, he says. It will be fun, he says.
Guess I should have taken a longer swimming start
I meant the novel Moby Dick, not the whale.
Payback's a bitch, isn't it?
Ahab is right behind me.
I should have specified I meant the book.
Oh, I heard this property was about to be underwater.
A beached whale smothering a stranded castaway; yup, I think ol' Danny Shanahan was drawing a metaphor for the modern economy.
Oh dear! Another Poke-mishap!
Call me "stranded".
I'm afraid you need a root canal
My pod-leader said your name is Ahab.
Some genius apparently decided to do a Defoe-Melville mash-up.
The accidental killer whale.
I tried to tell you, "whales don't climb trees".
Okay, which of us is in the wrong idiom?
WILSON!!! WILSON!!!! HELP!!!
I guess this tooth pic comes with a garnish
Guess I got a little aggressive on that jump.
Will your travel insurance cover this?
But I love you.
There goes my desert island fantasy! Should have been a little more clear when I prayed for a companion.
Heard of a humpback whale? I'm a humpforward.
I meant the novel!
Sorry about your cruise...but that all-you-can-eat buffet was extraordinary.
1. we definitely have issues with our travel agent 2. sorry i ordered the bass
Gotcha
Your UberSea is now arriving.
Ahab? Ahab?!
I read it was a " dessert island"
I told you I could breach...
Sorry I didn't realize this island was inhabited.
Is this better, Jonah?
Robison Crushed So
Jonah instantly regretted climbing the tree with his new friend
And now for your second wish?
I SAID NO HUGGING!
Scene from the twisted alternate ending of Free Willy
Who's Moby Dick now?
Island Hop Fail
Sorry, I thought you said "beach" not "breach!"
I finally got you, Ishmael!
Hey, don't blame me for global warming!
Robinson realizes whale psychiatry carries a heavy load.
Sorry, I'm just so over the krill.
I've missed you, Max
Ahab didn't like to cuddle either.
Cannonball?
Sorry, pal. This global warming thing is definitely real.
Call me Ishmael... or not.
Don't blame me, blame global warming.
Life's a beach.
Well the Airbnb listing did say "shared island!"
Thanks for sharing
You never accepted my invitations so I thought I'd come over.
Face plant!
Dear Mom & Dad, Having a whale of a time on vacation! Love, Johnny
No rush. You're not my only problem.
Now I know how Jonah felt!
Wow. This guy's going to smell after a while.
What were the odds?
Moby, you have no idea; the stress is really crushing me.
The guys at Woods Hole think their chip implants are s-o-o-o-o perfect
I just wanted to cuddle
Sea food has always overwhelmed me.
JONAH!!!
Okay, now slowly drop the fishing spear into the water.
Does this make me look fat?
This is not what I meant when I wished for a whale of a time
Call me Squish-ya-well.
It's like ra-a-ain, on your wedding day...
I didn't know this island was occupied.
Scratch a little to the left. Aah, right there.
A man who's an island always gets wailed on.
If you were stranded on a desert island, what is the one . . .
The pet whale makes me long for my dog back home.
Oh great,marooned. What are the chances of that happening?
Looks like we need to replace this crown.
And…heave! Hey, I don’t feel any heaving.
Too bad I didn't bet the over/under! What are the odds of a beached whale AND a beached man on the same tiny deserted island?
Stranded on a desert island, and all I've got is Moby Dick.
At last, Timmy, separated for 20 years, was re-united with his beloved master.
Sorry, they’re filming Whalenado.
Turns out, there aren't other fishes in the sea for me.
You are so negative.
For the last time, you fool, it's humpback, not hunchback.
I just wanted to be friends.
I know I wished for a whale of a time on this vacation - but easy does it.
I have a lot of social anxiety about people not wanting me around.
Aruuumpaaaa (translation Oops).
Lot 43. Charcoal drawing from the estate of Ethel Melville. Draft 3: "Ahab's Demise". Up next....Lot 43 from the estate of Ethel Melville. Drawing in charcoal: "Ahab's Demise".
Each of them ran out of luck that day.....
I don't care what they say about Global Warming. The water is COLD!
Well, why'd you think we were called sperm whales?
Forget 'Ismael'...call him an ambulance!
Two out of three?
Yeah? You try swimming thousands of miles and singing at the same time.
Ishmael, I'll take the story from here.
Oh come on. I've already lost 5000 pounds on the Low Krill Diet.
I don't know...We just clicked.
Ahab. Ahab?! AHAB!!
Call me Moby.
I'm lost; can you help me out?
I thought you were the Wicked Witch of the West.
Last time I ever use a discount travel site
Don't wait up honey, Jonah's giving me a ride
The last stand of Cap'N Crunch
I never said that you were fat.
Oh whale, guess isle just rest here.
Yes, my name is Jonah, but I called Uber.
...Shouldn't have used 100,000 lb Test line!
"And then she swam away like she didn't even know me".
I was told I could find Willy here.
Can you fix it? I don't want to be known as Moby Dickless!
I didn't think the movie lived up to the book.
A little to the left and this is the best massage ever!
You called, Ishmael?
Marooned animal-trainer Ted's perfected his animal-call and now needs his rollover.
I swear this island used to be bigger.
Sharknado's got nothin' on me.
Saorry, buddy, but my GPS said, "Go straight."
Sorry, fella- you really do look just like that jerk Ahab!
Cartoon Whales matter!
Sorry Jonah, I didn't account for the change is sea level
But inside I truly feel I'm a Cockapoo...
The book?!! Well, perhaps you should have been more specific on your Desert Island list.
What have I done? When you said to 'just blow it out your blowhole' I lost it!
'The name's Johnny, not Jonah.'
Look, I'm sensitive enough about my weight...
I hoped you'd get me off the island, not have you on the island.
And a rock feels pain; And an island cries.
Her dream came true. She was stranded on an island with the man she loved. She had never known that he used to talk behind her back; telling his friends she was a big, fat whale.
Nice to meet you Ishmael. Call me full.
Sorry...I thought I was jumping the shark.
They called me Ishmael.
Better me than you.
Life's a beach, isn't it?
Sorry. I guess I am in your sun. If that's what you just said.
Ooh that is good now scratch a little to the left
You did pray for a miracle.
Really, thanks for bringing "Wilson" back, now get off me!
A Breach too far.
Hey, don't blame me for rising sea levels.
So do you think that Kim and Kanye will have more children? What about Khloe's morning makeup regime? Rick? Rick?
So sorry. I've cleared this rock hundreds of times before!
And then there was the one that didn't get away.
I have a higher sleep number.
Who moved my island?
There goes the neighborhood!
This is not my idea of a whale of a good time.
Huh so this is the difference between a mermaid and a merman.
Fresh catch of the day.
Moby Dick's overenthusiasm had cost him many a friend.
Now that I saved one, what should I do?
You know, I'd really like to start out as friends.
You won't believe it. I just spotted a ship headed this way!
Stop calling me Ishmael!
You mean it's called "breaching"? With an "r"?
Land shark, my ass!
Hold me, Robert.
This gives a whole new meaning to "looks like a beached whale"!
Do you have a moment to talk about Poseidon?
I think you got it this time. My back feels great!
Sorry for the palm tree.
Jonah misunderstood and tried to swallow the whale.
Another game of Twister?
The menu said "Isle of Man" with date sauce
Maybe calling Ahab Rescue Service wasn't such a good idea.
Tragically, Friday discovers that Moby is freaked by Shark Week too!
In my defense, he did say "blow me".
Sorry; Autopilot's still in beta.
Darn! I knew I should have trained before signing up for the high jump.
"They were right...tastes like chicken".
Well he was a wailer...
Don't gripe, Ahab. You still have two legs.
Who you calling 'blubber-butt'. Ahab?
I know, but it says right on the app "Pokemon are not to scale."
"At least now only his feet will be sunburned".
I told you to lift with your legs
I'm lonely.
Can I get my volleyball back?
Getting to gnaw you, getting to gnaw all about you.
It hurts me worse than it hurts you.
Hey -- where did you go, Ahab?
The Sperminator strikes again!
When whales think outside the box.
Something's fishy here.
you know what they say 'no man is an island', so thought i'd join you.
Now you have smashed my favorite stranded-island record by Maria Callas!
Hmm. Salty.
You'll be safe here, Job. Job?
I need to speak to Jonah's PR man and I need to speak to him now.
Is the pressure too hard or too light? Don’t be afraid to speak up. I'm here to help you, not hurt you.
It has clearly of late been brought to my attention that one nameless party has forgotten the agreed upon, whose side of the island belongs to whom.
A bit harder, to the left.
NO! NO! Not exciting enough. Have the whale swallow him; not just sit in him.
Almost Paradise
Sorry about that - I heard "beach" not "breach"
Sorry, just looking for some sun
Sorry. I thought it was my girlfriend in a funny hat.
Okay Pinocchio, I'm not going to swallow you this time..-
How was I supposed to know you meant the book?
Just blame it on global warming!
That's it!....keep pushing up!....now you've got it!...lift, lift....
Hello God, this is Jonah.
Ishmael? Are you okay? Ishmael?
If you can't eat them, join them.
I guess I washed out on the dismount.
Sorry, I'm not ticklish.
Well it sure looked like a shark
I only wished for a whale of a time on a remote island.
Obsession can go two ways, Ishmael.
"Cetacean sedation".
Now do you see that we can't live here together?
Sorry pal you looked so much like "Ahab" my instincts took over.
I said, "I TAPPED OUT"
This is called a chest-bump in Whale.
Excuse me, mind if I join you?
Another heartbreaking whaled beach.
You made it look really comfy up here.
Hello press, This is Gilligan. We have been rescued.
It's sink or swim out there.
'Isle' always love you! Get it? Bill?
He probably wouldn't have been rescued anyhow!
Island dessert
Hey, Ahab, how are tricks?
Sorry, I thought I saw a ghost crab.
Sorry. I've always wanted to "stick the landing." I just didn't know you were there.
Sorry Robinson, my bad.
Moby...DUCK!!
Friday, the whale, has proved to be very affectionate.
As soon as I get your blubber changed, you can be on your way.
Get Ishmael on the phone. I've got a great idea for a sequel.
We can't go on like this, Harvey.
The map said "I Land"
I'm a vegan, I swear it!
"Tastes like Tuna".
1 ---- 2 ---- 3 !!!
That'll teach you to call me a Moby Dick!
This tale will not last 376 pages Ahab, 1 and done.
Isn't it a struggle surviving here on your own?
If you’re going to keep building in the South China Sea, at least put up a sign.
Too much roughage.
I thought you said friends support each other...
I am not whining, I just need to get something off my chest. Please get off my towel.
Taste like Chicken with a touch of palm oil
Stop kidding yourselves, people. NO lives matter.
I brought you company. His name's Jonah.
Uh, buddy? A little help here?
Sorry. My bad. I thought that waving tree was my boyfriend's whatchamacallit.
Did someone call for help?
That's affirmative: It's a sperm wale.
So, you won't need the sunblock.
I'll give you that, you were beached before me.
Next time you ask to be stranded on a desert island with Moby Dick, be more specific.
Oops.
"But you're taller," you said. "Get that damn seagull out of the tree," you said.
So you see, Cap’n, I was just playing hard to get.
Gilligan, is that you?
Hey, get off me, I was beached here first.
At least the island isn't deserted.
This ocean isn't big enough for the both of us.
Sometimes it's really hard to have a balanced diet.
Who said, "...teach a man to fish..."?
Beach volleyball, any...!
Next time, specify which "Wilson" you're yelling at.
just show me how to love you
We are both mammals after all.
Now you know how Shamu feels.
I saw how to do CPR by watching the life guards
Quit squirming! You said I could be big spoon.
Murphy's Law of Island Stranding.
I really have to work on my breach.
I am so sick of krill
Sorry, I had this coconut craving
Is it me, or didn't you have the word 'help' written here?
Something squishy touched my fin.
Nice to meet you, Ishmael.
I'm not being sarcastic when I say this is LITERALLY a really, really, really big whale.
I'm tired being the 'white whale', I want to be the 'tan whale'
Life's a beach, eh?
Sorry, but Sharknado 5 tryouts are next week.
Sorry -- helicopters freak me out.
Oh, I should give YOU a piggy back.
Where is Greenpeace when you need them?
Don't ever call me Ishmael.
Private island vacations aren't all that they're washed up to be.
I love you, Robinson Crusoe
I'm free, Jesse! ....Jesse?
I'm loath to sound cliche but we appear to be in this together.
Climb every mountain, ford every stream...
Another unfortunate beaching.
Darn global warming
But on the other hand you are right about the great view from here!
Ok, "Moby Dick" may be too-heavy reading for your desert island stay.
Looking on the bright side, I can get 2 short stories out of this.
I'm sorry -- your cologne reminded me of my mom.
WOULD YOU SCOOT OVER A LOT?
Between a rock and a hard place.
I'm not Jonah and no I don't want a ride.
Remember, you wanted the bottom bunk.
Sorry to drop in unannounced, but I could do with some company.
Up, Moby! Up!
You said I could cry on your shoulder.
Did I hear someone call for help?
Sorry-my sonar reading said 'sperm bank'.
Moby's a dick.
I guess you should push, I'll blow, and we will see what happens.
Oops,... my bad, are you o.k.?
I wasn't expecting you. The fish fry is tomorrow.
I'm sorry, Wilson!...Wilson, I'm sorry!...I'm sorry!...Wilson!...WIL-SON!
Humans really do taste like chicken.
Where are the Japanese when you need them?
Don't go!
Oops. Sorry, Jonah.
I thought it was a hypothetical.
You're suppose to beach yourself on a beach!
Season's Greetings from Heifer International
Thanks Expedia
Sorry, but my GPS malfunctioned again.
Flattering.
Some Beach!
Sorry, I thought you were Ahab.
Dude, you act like you've never seen a humpback whale before.
I should’ve know a pet whale was a bad idea.
You didn't swipe right?
You find me an optometrist and I'll watch out.
I don't think there is room for both of us on this island.
I always like the idea of tapas, but it leaves me unsatisfied.
Invasive species management one island at a time.
Are you sure your name's not Ahab?
My travel agent will NOT be getting a good Yelp review.
Oh sorry, you meant the book?
"So, what record album did ya bring?
Enough of the yoho whaling chanteys
I said UNCLE!
I'm going to flip this property for double when the sea levels rise.
You're batteries fine... but you're a little low on oil.
This is what happens when you don't add me to your Linkedin network.
The fish smell gets me too.
Hmm...I guess, on second thought, that I should have taken the bottom bunk.
This is a massive breach of trust...
Sorry, this was the only beach I could find.
I don't think you can be a lap pet.
Jonah, hitchhikers should'nt complain where they're dropped off!
Evolution really should have given me bigger legs!
Say "uncle" Ahab, say "uncle," said the Mobydick.
You are right. This island is too small for both both of us.
I guess they won't be calling you Ishmael any longer
The real story of Robinson Crusoe. Killed by a love starved near sighted whale.
I wonder how long it will be before he can hunt for food on his own
No, I'm the Wicked Whale of the East.
On the bright side, I've got a large bolus of ambergris just for you.
#betterthantrump
HeyMoby! I got here first!
Seriously, my whale oil is down a quart?
nice place ya got here.
All these years I thought I was a Humpback.
Having a whale of a time aren't we?
No Whale is to big to Fail.
Oh, Jonah -- at last we're alone!
Who did your root canal ?
I thought whales were beached not islanded.
I am eating protein and veggies and drinking plenty of water.
Honey, I went whale watching.
Most people set their pickup location on the edge of the island.
Sorry--it was my first attempt to jump the shark.
....and to think that it dropped Dorothy's house onto the Wicked Witch.
Bait! And Switch!
I thought you were going to jump first.
I swear, I had the barnacle dream again!
I feel like a beached whale.
We should consider reducing the degree of difficulty in our synchronized swimming routine or we'll never qualify for the 2020 Olympics.
Mmm, crunchy and chewy!!
Sorry Jonah. I missed you.
While you're under there, could you replace my intake manifold gasket?
Clumsy me. When will I learn to watch where I'm going?
Call me Moby Prick.
Oh NO! Wrong coordinates, again.
Can I ride on top please?
Like I said, you do not look like a beached whale in that swimsuit.
Sorry man, it looks like a failure of my new pre-collision braking system.
Let's rethink that plan to use the palm tree as a catapult
Sorry. I was overcome by an overwhelming urge to return to the land.
Beached. Bummed.
Trigger warning: Whale.
So then I said...listen Ishmael.....
Please don't leave me!
C'mon, you were dead inside anyway.
Your wife paid me a small fortune to find you.
I heard you could use the company.
I stole your seat?
Sorry our visit is short-lived.
I don't understand. Why do you feel I'm a burden?
So why should I call you Ishmael?
I'm glad you could see me on short notice doc, the toothache is killing me.
"Uncle" or say "Orca".
Oops. I thought you were away on holiday at this time of year.
Ahab's nephew? I had no idea! Honest.
I should have asked for chicken
Survivor sandwich!
help me you fool, i'm beached!
Free Willy's open audition.
Sorry, since getting kicked out of Sea World, I am space challenged.
Found you!
At least I left you with both legs this time Ahab
There, no more whaling songs from this idiot.
In hindsight, using plankton as deodorant was maybe not the best idea.
So you think you are stranded, do you?
Got him! That was one honking big mosquito on your back.
Okay, Pinocchio, you can get out now! It seems that we've found Geppetto
A little help, please.
The best and worse day in the life of a castaway ...minutes after being spotted by rescue ship...
Oh, sorry! Pardon my breach of etiquette...
Call back later. The reception is terrible.
"Hey, I know 'no man is an island' but that doesn't include whales".
Sorry dude. We were here first.
Of all the dirt piles in all the oceans in all the world you had to beach your blubber on mine.
Sorry! I was just working on my beached body.
Ironic you escaped Moby Dick
''Is it too late to cancel my whale watch tour.''
Please read me one more story before bedtime.
Hey, have you ever considered the benefits of a Vegan diet?
I promise I'll never turn my back on you ever again!
Ahoy, you there, Ishmael? It's you I'm calling.
This'll put an end to your wailing.
Uncle! Uncle! Uncle!
John Done
My mother Moby sends her regards.
Sorry, Matey...thought this was my wife.
I can't believe you don't have Uber here yet.
Whoops. Just wanted to try it out while it was still here.
Think of it as a chance to get out of the sun.
Well, enough about me, what do you think we should do?
It's your turn to sleep on the wet spot.
So sorry-absolutely no sense of direction.
Let me go and you can have my best friend, the tree.
Oops, I guess I've never been much good at island hopping.
Have you seen Dory?
I'm right here if you need to talk.
I can already tell this place is understaffed!
Eeek, a mouse!
Oops, my bad. I was just trying to catch some air.
Hi ho, the wicked witch is dead!
You just looked really lonely up here.
Can you push me back into the ocean?
I just want to be loved.
Hey, what's the wifi password?

Did you get the tree I ordered for you?
pleased to make your acqweightance
She told me to meet her here at 6.
Calm down Ishmael! I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship,
Deep deep down, I still feel needy.
Why did not one ask me what companion I wanted if stuck on a desert island?
Sorry! I was distracted by making whale sounds while swimming.
I can't wait to see Mom's reaction to this piercing.
Oh! You wanted to jump on my back?
So much for getting a tan today.

You may call it a hostile takeover, but I call it being a winner!
Have you tried lofting your bed?
Sorry, I can't stand wailing.
He would not stop singing about cheeseburgers...
Does this make me look fat enough?
Speaking for many charismatic mammals, we love you too.
Get off before I whale on you!

Just my luck. Stranded with a flat.
When you wish for something, make sure to know how to spell it... I am not a wale.

Would you consider a tax-deductible contribution to WDC?
Sorry, new Uber driver!
I know it's hard being afraid of water.
Ok it's a deal. You get me out of here and I'll take care of climate change and sea level rise.
Wait. Do I say "stranded on a desert island, or stranded on a deserted island?"
No, I said little bit {italics} of paradise…
You should have seen the one that got away!
Um . . . I don't think this "speed dating" thing is really working for me.
Sorry. This is where I come to take a break from swimming.
Yes, I know. Please excuse me.
Oh, Well! Another mess I got into."
Well, I think climate change is just a very, very expensive form of tax
Having a 'whale of a time' on vacation
I love this new Tummy Bahama line.

Nice to meet you, my name's Friday.
HRRRRGLAA. HUUUUURRR. That molar right there. OHRRRRGRRTLA. [violently ejaculates.]
Hope no one saw me choke mid-breach.
Is there a cantina in these latitudes that serves a really great margarita?
No, I think this more resembles 'Bartleby the Scrivener.'
Great! Now to find a net to floss with.
Moby-Mensch, you've changed, man!
When whales beach.
...and that's when he realized he had messed up.
I thought for sure he'd change dir........aargh....
Beach please.
They say whale mechanics are a dying profession.
Sorry, I'm always confusing breach with beach.
Sorry sir, the ocean is super big and scary.
All I wanted was a nap under the palm tree!
I thought you was my sweetheart.
Ugh, Whale Yoga AGAIN?

You beckoned, Ahab?
LandBlubber.
I just can't stuff myself with meals, I can't move afterwards..

Sorry 'bout all this. Really I am. I just got tired of swimmin'.
My life was a beach, and now I have to deal with this on the top of it.
Seaworld is not even trying anymore.
Can someone call AAA, somehow I got high-centered and I need a tow!
Whale, that's a shame.
Sunday's are my cheat day.
"Because I hate you" God
I can't hide anymore.
This is not what I meant when you asked me what I'd like to have on a deserted island!
I just thought I would get a few rays in.
My bad. I thought that was the show jump signal.
Cruz? Oh!
Well, Whale, vacations over !
Sorry guy, I booked the trip through CHEAPO ISLAND HOPPER>

"Hey, I was here first"!
What? You said you'd bring Moby Dick.
Hey Mr. Geppetto, Can Pinocchio come out to play?
I just can't seem to get comfortable. Something is poking me in the belly.
Yo, Ahab. Can you move a bit to the left?
Gotta get that fiber with the meat.
I was sitting under a palm tree for a whale.
I hate cliches.
Darn, I'm stuck, without the help of a cartoonist to modify this predicament.
Get off me or I'll tell Ahab!
Sorry, I didn't mean to breach our contract.
Starters!
Am I right for Antartica?
What rotten luck! How in the heck did I end up getting beached in the middle of the ocean?
Wicked witch of nor'easter
Where in the whale am I?
Sorry, there's no room for you and Jonah.

It's my Western diet.
I told you to stop calling me 'Wilson!'
It's gonna cost you... looks like you need a new chassis.
David now understood why the pirates laughed when he chose to be marooned with Moby Dick.
You think he's still down there? Hello?
You're not alone anymore!
Mom! Mom, I forgot the dental floss!
So THAT's why they call it an island.
We're not in Kansas anymore!
With millions or more of acre miles of water and small isles out there why did you pick this one to beach on?
I overshot the Jonah-swallow-rescue maneuver.
I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.
I count to ten , I win!
I can tell you Jonah, the only constant is change.
Beaching on a desert isle: The whale equivalent of a splashing in a kiddie pool.
Excuse me; I prefer the left side.
Scratch me right there...
Better for you that I had breached than beached.
...and you can call me your daddy
Stop WAILING, I hate this as much as you!
You're in my body buffer zone.
Rising sea levels — a double-edged sword.
What are the chances? I ignore my mom's advice against breaching and I end up here.
Did you pick up milk on your way home?
they both taste like chicken.
Because I'm bigger and I have more incisors.
Oh dear! Curiosity killed the castaway.
Thanks for helping me pick the coconuts.
Who cares.... This beach is MINE!
I told that crazy theme park trainer that I couldn't do his trick.
Washed ashore
Help me birth this calf.
hmmm...guess I need to change the mattress number.
Flattery will get you nowhere.
I'm a beached whale.
Even whales don't like pollution
'Hot Tuna' is your desert island band?! You can do better than that.
I've got to stop dreaming about sushi.
I told you to scootch over!
Flattening you got whale nowhere.
I guess I've gained weight since my last visit
Oops. Sorry. Mom must have sang 'Breach' yourself and not 'Beach' yourself.
At least spare that tree!
Maybe you shouldn't have picked Dirty Dancing
You never accepted my invitations so I though I'd drop by.
Moby, go pick on Ahab.
You wished for a bridge over troubled water.
The punchline is killer, isn't it?
Sorry, I flunked out of Flying Whale School.
Darn global warming! That sea level rise keeps messing me up.
I always enjoy some tropical greens with my meat.
Now pop back into the tank please Moby
No one mentions this when they blubber on about how great coconut oil is!
If this what they really mean by South Beach Diet?
I feel the need for a hug.
A washed-up genie in a bottle and a marooned cruise line comedian - it was inevitable
I don't think this tropical remake of Wizard of Oz is working.
Hello, ground!
Another fatal encounter with the mysterious and dreaded humpfront whale.
A fish out of water can trump a whole nation.
Wait... this is not how you play it?
Not the Moby Dick or 'Castaway' tale he would've hoped for.
This "beaching thing" is kind of instinctual, not logical.
darnit, guess i'm not going to the olympics this year..
I'd like a sand witch whale done.
Mom was right about flossing twice a day.
At least there's no %!&* Greenpeace to try and pull me back in.
Sorry!!! I coulda' sworn Mom said "beeeeeeeeach!"
The Dad, spending the day at the beach, was crushed to death by his Fudgie the Whale Father's Day cake from Carvel.
Your name's not Jonah? Sorry pal, but you're a dead ringer for a guy I used to swallow.
Listen man, I need a rest too, okay.
And why don't you find another island to get marooned on.
My breaching turned into a beaching.
Being sidelined by the unthinkable, even on my day off.
I'm happy to see you too, Flipper. Now get down!
Help! I've been Trumped!!!
This is a real whale of an island you've got here.
Moby's mom always told him to eat greens with every meal
I normally don't have a salad with my main course, but this is delicious.
Pardon me, gotta' catch my breath, it's been a really trying day... Not to mention, I just had another run-in with that ridiculous Captain Ahab.
The New Jersey Turnpike has cleaner rest areas.
Has anyone seen Ahab?
Got to love that extra value menu!
Sorry, Crusoe - I just couldn't suppress the urge to beach myself.
Aquaman said you needed assistance?
I was aiming for the volleyball.
Sorry, I had to do something to stop you from going to SeaWorld.

Ishmael, how many times have I told you
Too much love!
The genie was unfamiliar with the concept of a "desert island book."
Cut from scripture...The wale that diobeyed God when told to swallow Jonah.
We need to talk.
Please accept our collective "NO bottles of beer on the wall!"
Beached whales don't always receive the sympathy they seek.
(No caption please!)
Did I nail the audition for "Flipper"?
Sorry! Beaching exercise.
Whale of a trick, isn't it?
I need to get my eyes checked.
The blind humpback whale's romances always ended badly.
Snack time!
At least I swallowed the coconut!
You're absolutely right, it IS moby!"
Come on, I love fish!
We're making evolution history here.
Ugh! Who changed the preposition? I clearly read the script as, "Jonah goes under the belly".
Share? OVER MY DEAD BODY!
I realize that it may take awhile for you to accept my dependent personality disorder.
Donald, having a whale of a time. Wish you were here.
I'll go in halfsies with you for dish TV.
Blubber!?! Take this, land lubber!
Dire Oncle!
My usual favorite, protein, carbo and veggie in one meal.
You're having a bad day? They call me a bloated whenever they think I can't hear them
No one ever liked my singing before!
That's what I get for standing under a palm tree.
What? I Thought Sea Levels Were Rising!
It's the legs! It's all in the legs.
Now that'll teach ya not to just go stick your head in the sand!
I'm sorry for any inconvenience. I only want to rest for a few minutes.
Sorry, Starbuck, this is my neighborhood.
The "free willy" reboot wasn't quite as popular as the original.
I thought he looked lonely.
Hi, Ismail. I'm just trying to escape Donald Trump's Twitter feed.
Thanks for helping me train for the Olympics but I think I can take it from here.
Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey may have had a bit more practice.
Hey, Moby, you're blocking the sun!
Housing crisis and crowding are spreading worldwide
Look, I'm used to being beached, but I can't help that you have lost your shade tree.
My one wish is to spend the rest of my life with the man of my dreams.
The Story of Jonah: Gen Z Version
Just an oil filter change and lube today.

Did he eat the horse too?
No one pirates MY song!
What to bring to a deserted island...the last choice.
It really works--I've lost 10 tons on the six small meals a day plan.
I think I found the wall that Mexico paid for.
Ah, the joy of peaceful co-existence!
I thought we were friends!
Whew! Enough with the Springsteen!
Retribution for using the blubber taunt.
Newspaper ad: " Small, lovely Pacific island for sale. Remote, secluded, quiet and stress free. No one and nothing to disturb your peace and tranquility."
Stuck again.
Sorry, Moby, but you have a cavity in your third molar.
Oh Lenny, it's so lovely to always have someone to lean on.
No tagbacks!
In this era of global warming, beached whales are becoming more and more conmon.
Oops ... didn't mean to spoil your tranquility ... lost my contacts.
Got to get this female off my back.
'Welcome to Whale Island."
Oh, you meant Beluga Caviar.
You were expecting sharknado?
I told you, there's not room for both of us on this island.
Excuse me, but you do realize that technically this isn't a beach!
Awesome!
I'm glad you're here for your 5000 mile tune-up
The sperm whale goes island hopping.
I'm so glad to see you again!
I kept telling you people, 'Jonah's predicament was different from yours.'
Ugh! Just a couple more feet.
And I alone survived the beaching.
Oh, you meant you'd take the book...
A little more to the right and you'll scratch that itch.
Hey Mr. Splashypants, this is my island, not your beach!
Islanded whale
This place is so much smaller than I remember, right honey?
Sorry - I was trying for a personal best in long jump.
You should have read the fine prints.
This island isn't bigger enough for the both of us.
