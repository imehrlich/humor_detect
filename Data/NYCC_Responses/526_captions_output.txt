It’s true! He calls me His co-pilot.
I got it at a garage sale.
You wanted a bigger halo, yes it is razor sharp.
You had me at Halo.

You wouldn't believe what our daycare charges for parking.
They let me upgrade in Atlanta.
I had just finished washing the dishes, folding the laundry, and cleaning all three bathrooms when I got hit by lightning.
Let's talk endlessly about your feelings and my inadequacies.
What do you *mean* they only come in two sizes?

It was only a dollar more to supersize it.
Apparently pride is not one of the seven deadly sins.
Sorry, I don't date angels with big halos.
It's a loaner while mine's in the shop
I don’t mean to brag, but it’s true that my large halo is indicative of…. And, if your small halo means what I believe it does, this could be a match made in heaven.
I used to have a huge afro.
Mama insisted that they give me the biggest halo.
This way, it's better for hula-hooping.
You're really going to blame me for the halo? I died--that's all I did. I did not ask for one THIS big. Oh, come on, don't give me that look.
Stop worrying about my fidelity, God will not let me remove this wedding ring for eternity.
Mine's actually a lenticular cloud.
You heard wrong. God does play favorites
If I knew I'd actually have to wear this ridiculous ring you got me for eternity, then I never would have said "I do."
I have to admit, I hang with the best of them.
I got here by playing 'portal'.
Lord knows I need a hobby, so this doubles as a hula hoop.
It tarnishes easily.
Nah, I still won't believe it until I see the size of your hands.
Believe me, if I had met you, this would be a much smaller halo.
I lived a perfect life, and I all I got was this lousy big halo.
Want to have sex? I'm very, very, very, very good.
You make me downright upright.
They fit it for my ego. What can I say? God loves me most.
It's not easy being holier-than-thou.
Size matters.
Don't feel bad. I'm just nicer than you.
It's because I never signed up for Facebook.
As you can see, we have no glass ceiling here.
Halos were based on self-review so as a mediocre white man what did you expect.
I suppose you prefer bad boys.
Wasn't I good enough for you?
...But how do you know I find you attractive?
If only you hadn’t gone away for that weekend with your boss, Sally
You know what they say about big halos, right?
I just keep things in perspective.
What 'holier than thou' attitude?
Please give me a chance. I’m a bad boy at heart!
So they took it metaphorically when fitting the halo to the size of your head?
I can't tell you how many times I've been mistaken for Him!
Heaven?
THIS is who I am to judge!
I guess I'm just more hole-y than you.
I got this before I went on The Biggest Loser and lost 140 pounds but they won't change it in case I regain it.
I'm in the preventative virtue program.
It's really not that much of an accolade.

I think it was my insistence on eating only sustainable arugula.
SORRY, I'M A VIRGIN

I was much heavier then.
It's apparently what happens when an erection lasts longer than four hours.
Well, we couldn't do window offices.
It came as a free upgrade on my last flight!
I'm not sure if it's an extra-wide halo, or a portal about to suck me up.
Alright, I'll give you more of my halo if you'll drop your demand for bigger wings.
Believe me. size does matter.
I know it looks big, but it's comfortable.
I told you to check the expiration date.
You know what they say: big halo big.....
It's a little embarrassing.
Excuse me. Would you say this is fostering an excessive sense of entitlement?
You thought "holier than thou" meant something else?
No, it's actually not that, rather I was the national president of the Chubby Checker Fan Club.
Is your halo compensating for something?
So Pride and Envy are no longer Sins of Exclusion. Who knew?
So you're telling me that size does matter.
Yep, I'm a virgin.
All those Facebook posts that I liked and shared finally paid off.
The other angels are saying we were paired together because you need to pay for previous sins.
It's not what you're thinking - I have a big heart.
Hillary and Donald for President, for sure!
It's nearly impossible to use this hula hoop with these wings .
No, I'm not 'compensating for something'.

Because He's God, the Father.
I wanted the larger halo
It doesn't quite fit into my Maserati, but I make do.
You should see the size of my hands!
Your thoughts are interesting. My whole perspective has changed.
Size matters here too.
You should've seen the size of the planet it came with
I did some extra credit.
It's not the size that counts, it's how you use it.
These wings are detachable.
They ran out of halos. They gave me a hula hoop.
No, I don't think it makes you look fat.
No, I just loved to hula-hoop.
Maybe couples skydiving wasn't such a good idea.
It doesn't work that way, I'm afraid
I told you to wear your seatbelt.
After four hours I'm supposed to call my doctor.

Want to fly over to the next cloud for a milkshake?
I got it at Costco.

We refer to it as the 'glass halo' effect.....
Don't give me that holier-than-thou attitude!

Guess who asked for directions to the heavenly bathroom then put the seat down?

Yeah, they're sending me back to Purgatory to work off the rest of my ego.
Hula hooping accident, what about you?

The Boss likes to play cornhole corn toss, he likes to win!
It's bigger because I ate angle hair pasta all my life.

Well, it's really in how you use it...
You think it's big?
Gender equality hasn't come this far yet.
Remember the salary differences you discovered at work?
It's not the meat of my halo, it's the motion
It's just a lot easier for a woman to remain pure. That's why.
Mid after-life crisis?
I know...it doesn't make sense. Even here, not all halos are created equal.
Wait until you see my hands.
And then I said 'Actually, sweetie, all lives matter.
Why, halo there...
I was actually getting ready to dump you right before the accident.
Well, since you asked, I was a champion hula-hooper.
I had halo envy.
I did.

It's not the size, it's how piously you use it.
I'm not one to brag, but I did invent the hula hoop.
I've lost a lot of weight since I've been up here.

It's the same here. Size does matter.

Let's just say a Certain Somebody was grateful I got some of His associatess out of the tech and home loan bubbles just in time.
I told them XL, but I did not know that the sizes ran this big.
Couldn't be helped. Only ones left on the rack were XL. I couldn't wait for a rain-check.
(Feb. 2017) Obviously our new President Hillary Clinton's bill is still pending but she'll keep at it and I'll be grandfathered in...its in the fine print!
Guess what? Size really does matter.
Sometimes deed size does matter.
I'm Gabe. Fifth generation.
This isn't like mortal sign you can try to disguise...
No, it's just a Hula-Hoop.
So, as I was saying, I was a career politician . Since I am the only one of my kind up here I got the aggregate Halo.
I swear I'm not compensating for something else.
I bequeathed my estate to the church.
I also voted for Donald Trump.
They gave it to me for creating a cure for Donald Trump.
You know what they say, "the bigger the hoop, the bigger holy!"
But you know what they say about angels with large Halos...
So I told God; you either make me an Archangel or I tell Satan about you making sure Hillary won.
It's not the size, it's what you do with it.
It feels a little mid-afterlife crisis, huh?
It was my mistake. I gave them my head diameter in millimeters.
Well Halo to you too.
I used to think I deserved it, but now it's just ironic.
Actually, I find the halo hoop is a great way to stay fit.
Hmm, I see my ... halo is not as big as yours
In haloes this is as big as one can get. And you know what they say about halo sizes.....
Yeah, New Yorkers hate when I call this place "Los Angeles."
First, let's talk about our future.
Makes it Hell to walk through a doorway.
Well, if you think THIS is big, you should check out my hands.
Why would you think legacy is how I got here?
All of her people said if we voted the right way, there'd be a special place in heaven for Super Delegates like me. Now you're telling me there's no sex?!
Can we ever be compatible???
Let me take you away from all this.
Wow, it looked a lot smaller in your profile.
No, it's not overcompensation!
The size of your halo correlates to the abundance of your emotion being felt at that precise moment.
It combines Pilates and Hoola-hooping for a whole new holistic approach to fitness.
Yeah, but I still miss my Ferrari.
Why, yes, thank you. I am holier than thou.
Unfortunately size no longer matters.
I actually listened to telemarketers
Maybe you should have thought of that before you majored in communications.
Before I died, "Size matters" sure meant nothing good for me.
It's in recognition of my having invented the hula hoop.
Could I get your number?" "Mhhm... no.
It's the result of my naturally holier-than-thou W.A.S.P. attitude.
I'm new here. I thought we weren't allowed to take them off.
I died in a freak Hoola Hoop accident.
Nope. . . I'll check the fladravian.
Mansplaining? No way. I was born with that, ma'am.
I'm looking at your eyes.
Have you done a lot of good deeds or are you just happy to see me?
Even for angels, size doesn't matter my friend
I've always been an over achiever.
I did succumb to the weaknesses of the flesh, but, I guess God cut me some slack for all my contributions to the church. To be perfectly honest, I would jump your bones right now, but I'm without funds for further contributions.
Since I met you I feel like I've died and went to heaven.
...which isn't to say that I'm NOT happy to see you
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
I taught fourth grade for thirty years and never raised my voice.
Do you ever wonder what we missed?
Apparently, size does matter up here.
I've got the biggest one in paradise.
Thanks, but I think you have the wrong idea. I have a bad case of halotosis.

I don't like to brag...
My father is kind of a big wheel around here.
it's a vapor cloud thing! You haven't soared through yet.
I can tell already we are a match made in heaven
From the outside, it must look like Swiss cheese.
I behaved badly, but I made up for it with a lot of guilt.
Looks like you are upgraded with the new mini iHalo!
Yeah, well my ex-wife said I was always Holier than Thou.
Oh, yeah, baby: I'm THAT good!
You sure we're not over compensating just a little?
Let's ditch the halos and get on with it
Yeah, I know, I'm still compensating; even here.
Yes, size matters in heaven.
I call it a 'Halo-Hoop'. Patent pending.
This I can tell you - my halo is huge. There are no problems with my halo. And by the way, my halo and I are going to make Heaven great again!
You seem incredulous but Bill Cunningham said that big halos are a thing.
Yeah, what they say about guys with large halos is true.
Kylie, you make my halo swell
They were all out of mediums.
I knew it!
You make my halo shrink!
It's a much better predictor than hand size. . . .
Yes, I do believe there's a correlation
I have seniority.
I was told I had an eternity to grow into it.
You can see that can't you?
It's because I was gluten free.
I was surprised to find a Costco up here
I had to jump through a lot of hoops to get here.
Is that a hula hoop or are you just glad to see me?
Small hands - big halo
Yes, I know it's a hula hoop.
Totally worth a joyless existence on earth.
I'll trade you my hula-hoop for your frisbee.
I shopped in the 'Big & Tall' section on earth.
You know what they say, Big Head, Big Halo....
I let the size of my halo do the talking.
Let’s just say my conceptions are not immaculate.
You wanna ditch the halos and get out of here.
I didn't realize they were asking for my size in cubits.
I need it to get FM radio.
I put the lid down.
This is what I wanted on the golf course, not up here!
Don't let the giant halo fool you, I'm a real jackass.
Brace yourself for a little too much "in your face" reality up here!
My monster from the id
Just so we are clear: I am not compensating for anything with this.
Me? I died saving a puppy.
WOW ! I was afraid you would be some crazy guy with B.O. and a beard.
Yup - I'm the Hula Hoop guy.
It's not sexism. I was just a better person.
'Mine's bigger'
I got it for my humility.
I got fifty of them from Costco.
I'm in heaven and I could hardly speak, as we danced together cheek to cheek.
I ordered it from the Trump catalog.
This proves that Mars is bigger than Venus.
The William Morris Agency. Why do you ask?
(thinking) Right buddy - ain't no way I'm gonna spend any time here with you!
I know, i know. It was just too easy.
You just act. You don't think.
Even here, size does matter to some.
I hope you are in to some kinky stuff.
Heart attack during a hula hoop competition. You?
Hi, I'm Richard. I invented the Hula Hoop.
I brought the potato salad to the church picnic.
You might say I was really meek.
It's not the size of the halo but the motion of the devotion, baby.
Wow...this is even better than ChristianSingles.com !
Compensating much?
They were all out of Men's Medium.
They Super-Sized me.
Ya know, Hector. Whenever you pop one of those blue pills everything on you swells. Look at the SIZE of your halo..!!
I died with the most toys.
Come, I'll introduce you to Mother Teresa...
Incognito browsing? What's that?
I'm new here.
What's an angel have to do to impress you?
I never once 'mansplained.'
Halo Envy
I'm going to make Heaven great again.
I've been looking for someone to sin with for a long time.
Turns out I was just dying to shed those pounds.
You know?! There are 70 more of us.
Of all the gin joints, in heaven she walks into mine…
Actually, nothing special. Apparently this is the size you get if you've led an incredibly boring life.
I always knew I was holier than thou
I shot Donald Trump.
I worked at the returns counter in Costco.
I am tempted, but I am holier than thou.
You can tell I am Mr. Right based on the size of my halo!
And what would make you think I earn more than you?
God loved my Hula Hoop invention.
This brand runs big.
And you know what they say about guys with big halos.
Oh, this? I ran a marathon and never talked about it.
I must be in heaven because you look like an angel.
Wow. You must have been really good, huh?
See honey, this is what happens, when you're "always right".
Sorry, but this is what 'totally jacked with six-pack abs' means on the dating apps up here.
Well, you know what they say—Large halo, big …
I told you that size mattered!
I know you're a Virgin but God instructed me to spread his holy seed.
It's not as big as you think.
WHAT DID I KNOW..I ASKED FOR AN EXTRA LARGE.
My doctor said I should keep an eye on it.
I used to sell Viagra.
It must be my karma.
I do most of my work in Texas.
I guess I got my karm-uppance.
If it stays like this another three hours I have to see a doctor.
You're a jet, but I'm still piston.
Yes, I am that guy who took down Donald Trump.
I guess size matters up here too.
I'm still a virgin
We're in heaven, so let's sin away.
"I just downloaded the 'Holier Than Thou' app.
I would love to stay and chat, but there are 49 beautiful souls that need me right now.
I don't usually tell this story, but, I was Hula Champion of the World until I got my wings...
I've always had trouble jumping through hoops.
My halo's not the only thing that's oversized.
It's my way of making Heaven great again.
I cannot tell a lie.
Turns out size doesn't matter after all, your conscience does.
I like to think it's relative to how Holy I am, but they say I should have read the size chart.
It's not a halo, it's a portal to another world. If ya know what I mean.
Size matters, right?
Up here size does matter.
Seriously? Size doesn't matter up here either?
The boy is now in Neverland.
We also invented the Frisbee, no biggie, but Richard got that one...
I like the new rating system, but it does decrease the number of angels that can dance on the point of a pin.

I was in a hula hoop accident.
Yes, Edward Thorndike would be proud.
And I have REALLY big hands.
Forget it. Size doesn't matter up here.

Marketing came up with it. It's called "supersizing".
But honey, there was a sale at the big & tall section of the store!
It goes along with the big hands
Also, I am told I have huge hands.
Are you a Virgin? Your halo tells me you are!
Honestly. Your wings look perfect.
If it lasts more than 4 hours I'm supposed to call a doctor.
You mean size doesn't matter up here?
..., and there's nothing wrong with the size of my hands.
Please contest winner news TV snow
I got extra credit for trying to ban assault weapons and high-volume bullet magazines.
What? I'm from Texas.
Fred! I had no idea we could pick our preferred gender up here!
Yeah, the rest were on backorder, so I had to go with the XXXL.
I asked St. Peter to super-size me.
So I said, 'Listen, man, I think my halo is bigger than yours.' And he still wanted to argue!
It's actually an iHalo 6 Plus, it was just released last week.
I wish I lie in Heaven because yes, I am compensating.
Yes, my halo has grown since you arrived
The 79% gender gap is pretty much the norm here, too.
I know we're both single now, but I'm still more partial to bad boys.
I'm a Trump.
Who says you can't take your elite mileage bonus with you?
"Bigger is Better" won't float up here buddy.
It all started with a Hula Hoop.
I have a lot of Likes.
Uh, I'm afraid it must be platonic, my crown doesn't fold up.
I actually brought it with me. It was my favorite dollar store hula hoop.
Yes, I may have exaggerated the truth a little.
Yes, I am God's gift.
True, I was a virgin.
Frankly I think they gave it to me as a punishment.
Yes, I've always had a big one.
I lived at this freegan house in West Philly way back when, and, I don't know, the big gauge just felt right. I'm not part of 'the scene' or whatever anymore, but I don't regret anything. It was a part of my life, you know?
" I've been asked that same question for an eternity and the answer is not just 'yes' but 'hell yes'".
This Halo model is hard to live up too!
I always knew we were meant for each other.
Only an angel would say that size makes no difference.
Frankly, I'd rather have a penis.
I'm to seek immediate divine intervention if it lasts more than four hours. . . .
It is a PONDEROUS halo!"
It may be Heaven but size still matters
Even here ... size matters.
Of course size matters!
You've got to be kidding me! So size really doesn't matter?
Yes, I supported Trump. Why do you ask?
'' HALO BABY ''
Alas...not my halo...just a hole in the ceiling...
It used to belong to a guy from Texas
Wait till you see my harp.
It must be Father's Day!
Cloud computing copy error.
Yep, up here we're all huge.
You're right, bigger doesn't, necessarily, mean better...but, in this case, it, necessarily, does!
You will text while driving. Hope you're satisfied.
Hon, it's a little late to exchange rings now.
I requested one with a sprinkler system for.... well.... you know, just in case.
and you'll be happy to know that, up here, there's no problem with it lasting more than four hours. . . .
Still not convinced my denomination was right?
Well HAY-LOOO there!
I see you're admiring my girth.
I got here before the market boom.
After graduation from the elite preschool, the rest was easy.
I can see it in your eyes...halo envy.
I never buy anything "off the rack."
I know it's smaller, but I had a better time down there.
Halo envy, my dear?
Nobody liked it on America's Got Talent either.
and it comes with pockets, too
Oh big hoop, big whoop.
You must be overcompensating for something!
Welcome, sister, to LGBTQ Heaven. How's about I trade you my king size halo for that slinky little gown?
Freedom from sinning is decreed here, I know, but let's ask for just one little exception!
I can't begin to tell you how many hoops I jumped through to get in here.
You can vote for whomever you want, it's the holier than thou attitude that I have an issue with.
Why yes! I am from Utah. How could you tell?
I'm here for the New Yorker's "Really Desperate Anti Trump Cartoon" campaign.
I was having a bit of a mid-afterlife crisis.
I got here because I never lied to any woman that I had not met.
You were expecting halo equality?
I jump through so many hoops up here that I had mine enlarged.
My halo gets bigger when I don't tell the truth.
Let's face it.....you' re no angel.
It's true what they say about men with big halos.
Well, I was the National Hula Hoop Champion of 1963. What about you?
You bet, I had big hands on earth.
Halo. I love you. Won't you tell me your name?
Goodness ain't no hula hoop.
I'm pretty blessed...you know...up there.
Don't get me wrong, I'm no Saint.
Apparently "HE" was impressed with my invention of the Hula Hoop
Yes, well, evidently just getting here at all after 20 years in Congress is deemed worthy of special recognition.
Even up here you're overcompensating?
My! Your's is really big, isn't it?
Steroids worked for me!
I'm sorry - but your halo is so obvious.
Something tells me that you're overcompensating.
It was easier to compensate on Earth.
Big halo, big feet
So, yeah, I don't believe in the so-called Mid Afterlife Crisis... How about you?
Just wait until you see the orthopedist.
After all, you were just a rib.
Making up for small hands ...
You may know that the size of my halo is akin to the size of other parts of my anatomy.
Don't give me that look just because I have a swelled halo.
"Mine's bigger than yours." - Stanley Tigerman

And to think, you always said size doesn't matter.
Suddenly I feel like a Republican.
I can't help feeling holier than thou!
If this angel stuff doesn't work out, I could always light my halo on fire and join the circus...
Now what?
Nice try but I still don't think you're getting in.
Second wives have to grow into the job.
Big is better, baby--big is better.
I'd be happy to take you under my wing and show you around.
Let's compare after elections.
If you like my upgraded halo, you'll love playing my harp!
Listen, I know you said I'm too good for you but I don't agree...
So you know "gender has its perks"
I could use your grandiose halo as a hula hoop!
Well, what did you expect?
It's true what they say, I know, about angels and the size of their halos.
But I'm honest about my manspreading. That's why I'm here.
I'm not an idiot. You have a much smaller hole to get through to the next level than I.
Overcompensating. HE said it’s mine to bare.
They ran out of stock and had to improvise with a hula-hoop.
Does size really matter?
Well, it's pretty clear - size matters after all!
If you must know,I scored St.Peter tickets to the Janis,Jimi,Elvis,John and George concert.
I have really large hands.
What about coming back to my cloud and finding out for yourself?

I'm glad you swiped up
Hate heights hate flights hold me.
Yeah, I'll say it: holier than thou.
I told you to let God win that last round of Halo XBOX 360.

I promised you I would never even think about it. I guess you did?
Down on earth I was a swing state super delegate.
I also drive a Porsche
It's genetic.
I don't know if I'd call myself 'holier than though,' per se...
Its not an act. I really am holier than thou.

I can tell when you're lying.
...And you know what they say about men with big halos...
...but I'd have to leave here.
Ok, ok, yes, I still have the receipt.
I hear our new boss has an equal pay policy.
I was a hula hoop champion.
So size does matter after all.
I'm a bachelor; I haven't washed it yet.
I supported Bernie. Of course, I'm holier than thou.
Yeah, doll, even up here there's a glass ceiling.
The size of my halo slows me down, but I do get better service.
You're the most beautiful thing! Hi, my name is Pinocchio.
Have you heard from Adam and Eve?
You did notice I have very LARGE HANDS.
I am aroused. How did you know?
It's a NextGen Halo that doubles as a mood ring.
And you said, size doesn't matter!
Haaaalooo there.
Up here, for a big crown, we'll need evidence of inner beauty.
I understand that Size Matters here, too
An Oedipal victory and a lifetime of virtue...but that's enough about me. How'd you end up here?
I've got a big you know what.
I think you'd make a beautiful Victoria's Secret Angel even if you are actually dead.

People laughed when they saw my drawer full of 'Box Tops For Education'...
Well, yeah . . . as a matter of fact I am holier than thou.
Yes, I know women say size doesn't matter.
It's a little cumbersome but I get great Wi-Fi.
I like to think it's more tunic than dress.
So you see I was right in my "Holier Than Thou" attitude.
Single. No girl ever seemed good enough.
Up here you can earn a whole 85 cents on the dollar!
I'm not saying anything, but... when you flood the entire planet, people wonder if you're compensating for something.
I had to jump through several big hoops to get here.
If this lasts more than four hours I have to go to the E.R.
You know what they say. The bigger the halo, the bigger the . . . Oh, never mind.
Well, yeah, it's true, but it's not like it's going to do us any good up here.
What can I say, I died a virgin.
It's like pinocchio, except for good deeds

You mean halo size and virtue are NOT correlated?
He remembered I used to be the hoola-hoop champion
Up here the only thing of size that matters is your halo
I've been working out.
It autocorrected to "hula".
I was endowed in Heaven as on Earth.
If this lasts longer than 4 hours, we should call someone.
They issue shrink-to-fit now
D = 1 / F, where D is the diameter of a spirit's halo, and F the level of romantic stimulation of the past sentient being
So I said to Peter, 'I did save all the children in the fire, AND I went back for Spot.' Earthly-speaking, that didn't work out for me, but...

Let me show you about venn diagrams
Yes, that too.
Heaven knows, it's about time we travel in the same circle.
I was bigger when I first got in here.
In this realm, my dear, I am looked more upon as hallowed than just haloed"
I used to be humble, but what's the point.
I got nicknamed, 'Holier than Thou'.
Yes, I'm over compensating for shortcomings in my previous life.
Honey, I told you to stop for directions.
Does this mean we aren't a match made in heaven?
Like I said before, we were on a break.
Jezebel. That's an interesting name.
It's bigger than the Halo 5S, but it takes better pictures.
I'm afraid we don't count "Victoria's Secret" as previous experience.
I worked in a pizza place. You?
What do you mean, 'holier than thou'?
I had an ego problem on earth.

I had a head start

Sorry. Size did matter down there, but definitely doesn't matter up here.
Mine's a hula hoop.
I've really lost a lot of weight with the flying around

It's all true.
I have big hands too.
Good things come in small packages. Better things come in bigger packages.

It's about humility, but I can't go into details or it would be smaller.
It's actually a GPS device; I'm on a one day pass from Purgatory.
It's huge. I'm Trumping.
Is it actually you, ZEUS!!! Oh my god I am the biggest fan can o have your autograph. Uh I have no hands.
It's a symbol of the hoops through which I had to jump to get here.
Make Heaven great again!
When I got up here I found out that size IS everything.
I used to work in a pizza parlor.
Yeah, it's hard being the new guy in heaven.
You were right. I AM holier-than-thou.

My...what an enchanting halo. But if I remember corectly...hula-hoops eventually fall down!
I need to talk to a shrink.
That's a myth.
I cannot thank of anything to say "except" (is this a dream)???
Actually, it's more of a curse.
I don't think I belong here, it's a hula hoop.
Platinum Circle donor level.
Come here ad infinitum?
I got in late and all they had left on the shelf were hula hoops.
"Does this Halo make me look fat"?
I know what you're thinking, I can't lie up here, there's no connection.
Trust me. It's God who wills it.
Don't look at me like that! It's not the way it looks. It's ah...ah...a hoola hoop.
Maybe it explains the small hands?
I am a believer in equal rights. Your halo should be as large as mine!
I'll have you know, he's the only candidate who can make heaven great again; that's why he's getting my vote.

If there's no Starbucks, I'm not staying!
They ran short of halos, so I had to settle for a hula hoop.
Good heavens. You barely made it!
Actually I'm no saint. That's a manhole.
Exactly what you think it means.
Well, you know what they say about an angel with a big halo...
Wow! It wasn't hard to get God' forgiveness!
I’m literally holier than thou.
Oh, that's loop to go to hell."What!?
My mother said it would stay like that if I kept playing with it.
How about coming over here under my ring??
O.K.—I am just happy to see you.
They say "you can't take it with you," but I did, and this is what I bought with it.
Yeah, but my hands are really small.
Where were you all my life?
Is it too late to say I should have married you?
Raaally Dahling, all I can say is if the halo fits...
Bigger is not necessarily better.
Sorry to be holier than thou.
Fortunately, up here, size does matter.
Sometimes a big halo means, well, something else!
The Bigger the Ring, The Better the Sting.
Two tickets to Hamilton got me here and I see that he took you.
Of course you've heard the old chestnut, "Big halo, big -----"
Well, if you wanted a normal angel, your profile should have said "Spiritual, but not religious"!
He: I guess I should've listened to you and taken the left turn. She: Told you so.
I have a saturnine personality disorder.
Did it hurt? When you fell from heav...darn, that won't work anymore.
Heaven can wait.
Well, it's the girth, not the length, that really counts.
You only get the big ones when your really really good!
I guarantee you there's no problem. I guarantee it.
When I entered the Pearly Gates, they told me all the married guys got this size.
Trump's hands.
The Devil offered me a much better benefit plan, but c'mon it's Hell down there.
"Yeah, it's supposed to represent the size of my a ...hands.
Why is your glory hole bigger than mine?
I know, but I was a bigger sinner.
Still, I'd gladly give it up to have genitals again.
It's the Trump model.
I had a very small penis.
Hm, your halo, more than four hours? Better call your maker.
For the longest time I was saying 'holier than THEE.'
Hi Angel Face! Haven't we "halo-ed" somewhere before?
Does this halo make me look fat? Be honest!
I'm pretty sure that size does matter up here...
In Heaven, halo size indicates the same thing that hand size means on Earth. I'm just sayin'.
He liked it so he put a ring on it.
I have really big hands as well.

It's a rental. Sometimes, I need to feel Godly.
You know the amazing thing is that my angel ring is the same height as others. Go Hoosiers.
You see, mine IS bigger.
Well, I finally opened the 'options' menu.
That's one of the nice things. I mean, part of the beauty of me is that I'm very rich.
Yes, I'm really THAT good!
You got bad directions. The Victoria's Secret fashion show is shooting in Studio A.

It may look impressive, but I haven't been able to sleep a wink in eighty years.
Just a small halo...not all men die equally
Oh, come on, everybody's getting haloplasty these days.
I'm sorry, but this is still not a gender free environment.
First I got looped, then I got hooped.
Yes, Viagra works here. Just differently.
Up here, size really does matter.
This is why you shouldn't just buy a halo off the rack.
You know, there is another reason they call me the Big O.

I thought he said Hulu not Halo
The pearly gates weren't wide enough. I had to come in through the loading dock.
All I said was, "Super-size me!"
Up here, it is the size that counts.
I believe the circumference of one's halo is proportional to one's holiness.
Feel it? Til Hades do us part, we're a marriage made in heaven.
What, if anything, would lead you to think I'm exaggerating?

Is that a halo on your head or do you love me?
Isn't it obvious that I find you very attractive?
You should see my boyfriend's!
Apparently, I brought my ego with me.
I'm an angel too! We have so much in common.
I can see you were good but not too good.
Private wake, you know how it is.
Yes, it's true what they say about guys with big halos.
Because I didn't swear, steal, cheat on my wife; but mostly because I didn't vote for Donald Trump.

I'm afraid that we're incompatible
I wouldn't say I was especially blessed , but maybe...
You have to be in double digits.
Holier than Thou. No, why do you ask?
Why were we so dishonest?
No, I'm not still overcompensating!
Halo it's me. I've thought about us for a long, long time
My halo is happy to see you!
Green stamps.
Compensating for something?
Don't get excited, it doesn't mean what you think it means.
They have a Costco.
I'm really not over compensating
Oh for heaven's sake yes. Size matters.
Well mines's bigger than your's here too!
I've lost a little weight.
I'm from New York.
I used my bonus miles to get the halo upgrade.
I had it custommade
Well, size matters here too. Sorry.
Yeh I know... You're tired of dating nerds.
They only an extra-large.
Is there anything to eat around here?
You made it. That's what really counts.
I lived and died in Texas and I always wore a ten gallon hat.
Is that you, Caitlyn?
I let my dad move in with me when Mom died.
So much for breaking the glass ceiling!
I thought they were giving out something else so I said, "Give me the largest one."
There are degrees of goodness.
I'm suddenly kinda bummed by this non-corporeal existence thing.
Do you know that you have a heavenly body?
Men never pay attention. I told my husband John, I said John dear, we need new wheels for the baby's stroller.
True, I had a humongous ego, but I was good people.
I was the fifth grade hula hoop champion.
Aw thanks...but I've heard size doesn't really matter.
Do you come around here often?
hello...or should i say halo
Charlie, you look pretty bored for an angel!
I guess I can't use heaven must be missing an angel anymore so I'll just say hi, I'm Doug.
Alas, yes, size still matters even up here to us males.
Everything they say about large haloes is true.
At least up here I am well endowed.
It was a hula accident. How did you get here?
Now that you mention it, yes, I AM holier than thou.
Your halo looks much smaller than it appeared in your profile picture.
I can't believe we got away with it.
I guess this is where we part.
I was a virgin to the bitter end
I never thought I'd die to regret inventing the hula hoop.
I get a lot of likes.
A match made in heaven!
Size matters, especially in halos.
Up here, your halo's only as big as your ego.
I invented the Hula Hoop. How about you?
Yes I know, the big halo was not worth the life of celibacy
It's not an attitude. I am holier than thou.
Here you can lie as much as you want -- your nose won't grow.
That's right...you do the same amount of work but you get a smaller halo.
Unfortunately for you, the gender gap is eternal.
...so I said "Go ahead- as hard as you can- I dare you!
it has absolutely nothing to do with the size of the ego
Indeed, I am holier than thou, but I see thine potential.
All they left was the extra-extra large.
All they had left was the extra-extra large.
looks like a transgender halo to me dear
You know what they say about haloes...
So, do you use Tinder often?
" It's actually a Hula hoop malfunction".
I also have really big hands.
I'm off to a Kentucky derby party!
I just wanted to tell you how much I loved your brownies.
My "holier than thou" attitude is easily explained.
I sinned less, that's why I have a bigger one.
am I seeing heaven or is just me?
There is no glass ceiling for archangels
I had to exploit some big loopholes to get here.
As a matter of fact, I am happy to to see you.
Yes, bigger is better.
Big feet, big hands, big halo!
''Just call me archangel of the morning angel."
Yeah, I got reamed. So what?
i didn't know you could sing in heaven brother.
I would sin for you.
Yes, everything they say about a man with a big halo is true.
Hey, foreplay on the freeway was your idea.
What say you help me sin a little and bring it down in size?
I crossed over with High Honesty
Never hurts to ask for an upgrade...
Now who thinks size doesn't matter?
Obviously, it will take less time for your halo to reach this circumference.
You're the real angel, mine's just a hula hoop
What do you mean I'm acting holier than thou?
It's my God Hole.
That's nothing. Wait 'til you see these bad boys in my pockets.
I'll make heaven great again!
I know, it looks ridiculous.
Yeah, it means exactly what you think it does.
What makes you think I am lying?
You haven't upgraded to the Halo 6 Plus yet?
What makes you think I was staring at your wings?
"I don't understand why everyone calls me hoola-hoop head".
I'd like you to think I'm big everywhere!
Yes, it is!
And my hands are slightly larger than normal, too.
You never know who to trust in the world today.
. . . eighty pounds on The Biggest Loser, but it killed me.
My realm or yours?
I have no problem in the halo department. No complaints.
Well, actually it's not just my halo that's bigger.
Wow, you look great. But, if you used Halo, the shampoo that Glorifies your hair, just think...
is that a hula hoop on your head or are you just happy to see me?
I found my halo on Amazon. They deliver if you specify the cloud number.
I'm just saying, a plunging neckline may invite some unwanted attention.
"No, I'm afraid I didn't have a clue that you were always hot for me".
Discount shopping again?
Aaargh! How embarrassing. It'll be back to normal in a bit.
I guess size still does matter, even up here!
Why, yes, as a matter of fact, I AM holier than thou.
IT'S much more reliable than hand size.
HALO - R-US....NO DOUBT....
Yes Tina, In Heaven size does matter.
I won the cartoon caption contest.
If this halo lasts more than four hours, we should call a doctor.
Big halo, big...
Yeah, 'I know, rack dry, but how could I guess about some fabrics stretching?
I'm C=2piR and you're C=piD.
I hope hubby doesn't ask why my halo is smaller.
Well - the frequent flier points help.
Have you heard what they say about guys with long halos?
Someone got their wings clipped?
Can you tell I am happy to see you?
Actually, it's a myth.
I have a wide stance.
Perhaps you should have been more diplomatic in the confessional.
Separate but equal
Well haloooooooooo!
They say size doesn't matter.
Well ma'am, we Texangels is a right special breed.
Like my levitating hula hoop?
He forgives, but He hasn't really forgotten, has He?
Well this is what God gave me.
Excuse me woman.. is that a frisbee on your head?
Wanna shag?
Does your halo reflect the size of your fingers?
So I take it that you're not voting for me?
My halo says hello to you
No, I am not trying to be holier than thou.”
And here I thought HeavanlyMatch.com was just hyperbole
You know what they say: the bigger the size of an angel's halo. . .
Obviously women should go to hell.
I swear to God I did not do it! It does not appear that way to me Pinocchio...
I think he liked my sit-com.
I guess I'm happy to see you.
I died during a hula hoop contest
Go to bed with me and I'll tell you.
But, of course, I'm holier than thou.
Miracle-Gro.
I was the most honest and helpful employee at Costco
Actually, it's pronounced 'big halo', not 'big a-hole'.
It's a heaven thing. On Earth it would be an erection.
Don't let the small hands fool you.
I had house seats for HAMILTON.
Yes. The smaller one does make you look thinner.
Well, I hear you haven't been much of an angel either, Ginger.
I don't wish to seem holier than thou, but...
Why yes I did marketing for a fast food chain
It was the Lamborghini that got us here in the first place and you're STILL overcompensating?
I am just keeping it warm. The Greatest arrives this week.
The woman god is trying to punch the man god during he is closing his eyes!

Alas, what happens in Vegas definitely does not stay in Vegas.
I guess I've always been hole-y.
It's been more than four hours. Should I call a doctor?
Evidently size does matter.

I think this is their idea of a joke because down below I sold hula hoops.
I was wearing a Sombrero at the time of the accident...

Like our god-given salaries.
Did it hurt? When you.....well, crap.
"Yes, you had to put up with me your whole life, but I had to put up with your mother." (I submitted this under my another email but it had a typo so I'm resubmitting under this email)

As I said, I guarantee there's no problem.
Its my angel of the month award--I also get to go out to lunch with the Boss!

How we got pizza.
I was such a selfless player in the NBA God made mine more like a basketball hoop.

It's heaven. Small hands, big halo.
All of us angel investors got a golden halo, and as you can see, the growth rate was terrific.

The large halo? Well, I've always been very competitive.
Thinking of getting you a hula hoop my angel.

Not sure about halos, but I do know fingernails and hair continue to grow up here.
You're right. I HAVE lost weight.
So much for equal pay for equal work.

Your ego is showing.
"My halo is in the shop and they didn't have any replacements, so they gave me a hula hoop instead".

Because Our Father likes me better.
Seriously, having a big one is truly overrated.
You like it? It doubles as a hula hoop.
"A penny for your thoughts".
Well, I wouldn't want to brag, of course, but . . . .
I'd take tits over a big halo anyday.
Viagra seems to work differently here

I thought I would never see you again!!!!
I've been spending some time lately under halogen lamps
Before my passing, I graduated summa cum laude—non-credentialed—from Trump University.
There are no rules, you just wing it.

My wings don't let me use my hula hoop.
So, when all is said and done, size DOES matter

Decide fast! I can't keep this hula hoop up there forever.
You were right. I really am a "Holier than thou guy."
Your profile said you were more of a strawberry blonde
I'm scheduled for halo reduction surgery.
Just the opposite, regrettably. They named this the "holier-than -thou" halo for a reason.
Well I drove a Prius.
I try not to notice it.
My good deeds just vested.
Really, this only happens when you're around
Most people just don’t get my holier-than-thou attitude.

No that we feel younger and happy, can we try to unite the DNC and GOP
Would you go out with a big halo?
We have so much in common! Both headed our local Dump the Trump groups, both were murdered by Sig Sauer MCX owners, and NOW we're in the same New Yorker cartoon!
Not to brag, but I've lost a ton of weight since coming up here.
I trust you've heard the expression "too big to fail."
It's the Harvard difference, my dear.
Yeah, turns out it's an eternal truth.
I was a public school teacher for 30 years.
Careful, I'm not sure how big this thing is going to get!
This is why I don't like online shopping.
It's huge, it's really beautiful. Everybody says so.
I don't care how big your halo is, still not gonna sleep with you.
Accidental death by hula hoop.
The truth is, they hold our impure thoughts.
How about we get together and try to make a bullseye?
Yes, it is - and I've noticed a lot of you girls here have halo envy.
Well, you know what they say around here, 'Big hands, big halo.'
You're new here.
I left my modesty at the pearly gates.
I swear I'm not a virgin
You should see me trying to get through doorways.
Happy to see you? How can you tell with this billowy robe?
As the woman said to the gynecologist, "I'm dilated to meet you!"
I used to do rodeo rope tricks. It takes pracice.
It covers a multitude of sins.
I paid for premium.
Every time a bell rings my halo gets a little bigger
Well if 'size doesn't matter' up here, why am I getting all the free premium channels right now?
As I recall it, we bet double or nothing.
The standard sizes didn't fit.
"Eagle scout as a youth, high school valedictorian, multi-millionaire as an adult. Need I go on?
"I had to run through hoops to get here"!
You know, it's true what they say about the size of a guy's halo.
...yeah, you always hear that. But, looks like up here size REALLY doesn't matter...
I used a very accurate moral compass.
And if you get tired of being holy, you can use it as a hula hoop.
I paid to be at the front of the line, just like Disneyland.
You said size mattered.
You must be new here
It's been over five hours, I'm calling God.
I actually did save my customers 15% by switching them to Geico.
I bet you wish you’d liked that post about the sick kid now, huh?
It looked bigger on your profile.
We could always work something out....
And it's not even a problem if it lasts for eternity.
How can you not find 'holier than thou' attractive?
Size matters everywhere, my dear.
Have you seen the size of my hands?
It's sad that so many exaggerate their true halo size on e-Heaven, don't you think?
What can I say? I'm holier than thou.
Wow you're beautiful, did I live and go to Earth?
Apparently some of us shared more religious quotes and type amen!
I "liked" more Facebook posts than you did.
Sure it suits you - but size really does matter
It turns out that steroids affect your afterlife also.
Um, actually, wing size is a better indicator.
I know we said 'till death do us part' but I was thinking that we could go a little longer
I know it looks silly, but I get great cell phone reception.
Where did you get that hula hoop?
Well "halo," good looking.
I'm sorry. I was on my way to a rehearsal of "Angels in America," and fell through a pothole.
Yeah, back on Earth I used to take a lot of flak for my holier than thou attitude.
He actually apologized for the small hands faux pas, and hoped this would make up for it.
And my golden chalice comes with unlimited refills.
When I look at you, I get... larger than life!
Actually, I bought it on e-Bay...
I guess they never discovered the SEC Indictment
It's even signed by Beyoncé.
So you must be the Virgin Gary, am I right?
I just won a bet with the Big Guy regarding the USA election.
Than thou, moi?
Big head, big halo
I guess it gives extra points to remember the toilet seat.
I know...I know... it looks ridiculous, but the only size left was Republican Front Runner.
It's not the size of the halo, it's how you use it that counts. However, mine is Yuuuuge.
Does this mean I'm going to hell?
Soon you will have a big enough head to fit that Halo.
Just patented it, the Halo Hoop
yes mine is bigger than yours
I used to sell Hula Hoops.
Soooo, I see your halo matches your size.
My head has shrunk considerably since I arrived here.
I heard St. Peter was bad at geometry, so I told him it 4piR.
I never skip Halo Day.
Yeah, that comparison holds true up here as well.
I have the Hula Hoop concession.
Gotta say, your smile and youthful figure - together with the cute, LITTLE halo - has been much anticipated.
I was a protester at a Donald Trump rally.
I was breastfed.
Nice, right? Turns out mine was the deciding vote that defeated Donald Trump back in 2016.
Back on earth my shoe size was 13.
The gender pray gap is just a myth.
You know what they say about big halos and body parts!
How aura?
God gave it to me for my holier than thou attitude.
Without a doubt, I'm holier than you.
I'm afraid it's true even in heaven.
Lancelot said you dragons knew how to parry!
Actually, it signifies the same thing that big hands do.
I worked for this halo. White male privilege had nothing to do with it.
Angel and ANGEL
I'd say you barely made it.
You're a lucky gal - every time I swipe right, it's a match.
No, it's not overcompensation for my Trump-like physical shortcomings.
I know. This is just my ego.
Yeah, I HAVE lost a lot of weight since High School.
I won't say Holier than who, but you get the picture.
See Alice?
A large halo is actually a more reliable indicator than large hands. Trust me.
Sorry, you know what they say about men with big halos...
But enough about me...
Why so large? It doubles as a shower curtain rod.
You'll love it here. There's no other gated community like it.
My name is Trump.
To fit through that small hole.......you must be a size four, right?
The last woman who gave me that look, called me a "spreader" and knifed me on the subway.
Look at my halo. Is that a small halo? I guarantee there is no problem
Yeah...that's what they all say.
Honey, you always claimed to be holier than thou. So, I thought I would settle the score.
I'm from Texas, you know.
Yes, it is a bit showy but the reception is to die for.
Come back and interview again when your halo is more fully developed.
My insurance guy said the extra coverage would be good in perpetuity.
I'm a member of the honors program.
Of course my halo is bigger! I earned it by putting up with you all tho
Like I said, some men are just bigger than others...
I tell everyone I was really good, but it's actually a hula hoop.
'Size doesn't matter,' I believe were your words.
Sorry, I asked for dollars instead of pennies.
Until it's fixed, I'm stuck with the hula hoop
You probably think I'm compensating, but this halo is purely functional.
Have faith, my dear: As above, so below.
If I stop drinking RedBull, will my wings disappear?
Who says size doesn't matter?
Welcome to heaven for metrics analysts.
Halo angel face, haven't seen you flying around here before.
and god said your hella fine
Apparently, it's proportional.
Oh, Honey. You'll make friends. I mean, being alive wasn't all peaches and cream either.
It's called the penis effect...
I see you are still using Viagra.
Thanks, but God only knows why.
Can I interest you in the Bernie Sanders Revolution?
How about seven minutes of Heaven?
I worked in a pizzeria
Welcome to Cloud 9 and yes I have big feet too.
Size matters ... I think?
Is that you, Donald? Yes, Hillary.
You were right! I really was holier than thou
Pray tell....still wearing that same old dress!
If we haven't met before, it's likely because we travel in different circles.
The big halos can double as hula hoops.
Who said I am overcompensating for a small harp?
Marketing. You?
You know what they say...the bigger your halo...
Didn't Saint Peter tell you about the Super Size offer?
Pinocchio? No?,,,,,
Yah Gods my wing-angel
Where'd you get those great wings?
How did you know I thought you were hot?
I took the A-Rod route...
I was a philanthropist.
It's true what they say about angels with large halos.
Just say no.
You know what they say, everything's bigger in Texas...
It gets bigger every time I pay more taxes.
They say halos lasting more than 4 hours may require emergency treatment.
I've been told I'm very good.
Yeah that's right, I'm that good.
I use it as a hula hoop when I get bored.
Let me mansplain it to you.
Admit it; I had you at halo.
It turns out size does matter after all.
Well you know what they say, big halo . . . .
Yes, what you're thinking is true and that's one of the reason this place is called heaven.
Yes, in spite of my small hands.
Compensating for what?
Just friends? You mean even here they prefer "badboys"?
It's like viagra for heaven.
If only feeling holier-than-thou were a virtue!
The illumination is wonderful with a halo this large but it must also be nice to have a small halo like yours for the times when the soul wants some privacy. Anyway, are you seeing anyone? If not, wanna get together sometime?
"Oh," He says, "It's too small," He says, "So, what about this size? Better?" Then He just walks away, laughing.
Our wedding will be a double wing ceremony.
Turns out I AM holier than thou.
Darling it's not just a shameless pickup line, many have fallen for this halo
I'm saving myself for my next life.
It was another hula hoop related death.
I OD'd on Viagra.
$18.95 for my large pizza, how much for your small?
Well I happen to feel that the deluxe package was not a rip-off.
Why do you guys always think a girl likes it big around?
Actually, it's a hula hoop. I didn't qualify for a halo.
A marriage made in heaven is actually TRUE!
You'll notice I don't have to take my hands out of my pockets.
Angel of the Month is OK, I guess, but doorways are a real problem.
It's not all about size- its how you use it.
What do you mean, "Why are my hands in my pockets?" Can't you see how big my halo is?
I invented post-its.
When I said I was a big Halo fan, I don't think they understood I was talking about the video game.
Whoever said you can't take it with you clearly wasn't the Northwest hula hoop champion three years running.
As long as it doesn't last longer than four hours, we're cool.
Then autocorrect changed "halo" to "hula." You can guess the rest.
Did you lose your hula hoop?
It's really an ejection hatch if my wife is here.
Enough of the holier-than-though crap, please.
It's for my ego
I was really, really good.
Actually, I do think I'm too good for you.
Really it's just hula hoop. I brought it with me.
Yes. Big on virtue. Short on experience.
After I lost my third halo, St Peter refused to give me a new one. I found me this hula hoop in lost and found.
Mine is a portal
Hey babe, watcha doin' after eternity?
I may have stretched things a little with St. Peter.
That's not a halo. It's a hole in the ceiling.
You should trust the system.
Yes, as a matter of fact, I did vote third party in 1996!
I know he was your best friend, but what was I supposed to do when you were off saving the world?
I assure you I'm not compensating for anything.
Over-compensating has its compensation. Finally.
When Bae farts in an elevator...
My skylight is bigger than your skylight
Before your wingspan, the frontal assault on you. Badda-Bing!
You know what they say: big halo, big oneness with the supreme eternal ineffable.
If it lasts over four hours, I need to call my doctor.
Does this halo make me look holier than thou?
Why, yes, I did drive a Hummer!
Big halo ---- Big hands.
Oh, this old thing? Why, thank you.
My fingers are big, too!
I am a little tongue tied: it's been 560 years since I asked a girl out on a date...
".just love the size of your.........halo".
Good girls go to heaven (bad girls go everywhere)
I thought that a hula-hoop is out of fashion nowadays
I let my mother-in-law move in with us.
It's always gets big when I meet a pretty angel
The halos were on back order, so I used my daughter's hula hoop.
Well, one day God strolled by said Hello to everyone and you know Pete is hard of hearing and so now we have to deal with these things !
No, nothing special. Just an ozone hole.
It happened since I decided to vote independent in the upcoming presidential election.
Yeah, I've been doing Cross Fit.
They only had Magnums
Still with the holier than thou attitude, I see.
'The halos are on back order, but I got this hula hoop same-day delivery on Amazon.'
What have you done wrong?
I performed three miracles, but they'd already met this year's quota.
Touch it, it's real.
The swelling's supposed to go down in a couple of days.
If it lasts over four hours, I have to see St. Peter.
I had to go through many hoops before I got this one.
Wow, I didn't know that size would matter up here.
I guess I hafta tell you. Have you ever heard of Pinocchio's nose?
It appear you were right about one thing. I am really am holier than thou.
You know what they say about angels with big halos, don't you?
I'm a feminist
Actually, I spent most of my time on Twitter explaining things to women.
I think you're taking this size matters comment a little too seriously.
Given to those who still have a huge ego, I'm proud to say.
Your profile picture had a much bigger halo
I used to change the diapers.
The Seraphim got a deal at Costco.
I don't know about you... but i'm holy-as-hell right now.
You'll find size matters up here, too.
I was from Texas
You were right darling, size does matter.
You see, I was, uh, a virgin 'til I got married.
Sure the reception's slightly better, but I wish I thought twice before springing for the latest upgrade.
Yeah, you're right -- I AM holier than thou.
It's not that I think I'm more evolved than you, its just you're not as evolved as me.
Not that I'm holier than thou, but...
Money talks.
If you wanna get the boss's attention, you gotta think big.
I thought they said 'Would you like a big HELLO when you get there?'.
Yes, there is a gender-gap in the standard compensation for good works.
It came with the 'holier than thou'package!
Is it perfect here or is it just you?
There's something I saw 2 eagles do that I'd like to show you.
I just knew you were coming !
Because I have finally faced the reality that you will be taller than me for all eternity!!
Yeah, it's this app I've developed, Uber-Hailo
I know we should have fastened our seat belts
Well at least you broke through the cloudy ceiling.
My therapist says I'm going through a mid-eternity crisis.
Do you even tithe?
It was all that time off for good behavior.
In the other life, my thinking was cloudy.
I just wish you told me you preferred the bad boy type before I wasted 25 millennia.
It's a side effect of the medication that I was taking for erectile dysfunction.
Honey, I swear, I was out bowling with the boys.
Not fair - a celestial glass ceiling.
Believe you me, I'm no saint, but I do feel there's a lot hanging over my head.
After 25 millennia together - NOW you tell me you prefer the bad boy type?
You thought the wage gap was only a problem on earth?
Yes, I swiped right too.
No, no, nothing like that, I'm just real happy to see you.
As I suspected. Women get haloes, men get hula hoops.
Not exactly. They told me it represents how much better than other people I THOUGHT I was.
It's not hegemonic masculinity, it's just that God has favorites
No, it doesn't make you look fat.
Seriously, is He playing ring-toss, again?
It used to be my waistband.
it's actually the same size as my feet.
What can I say? Size matters.
You can't tell by looking at me, but I used to be very fat.
People always said I was holier than thou.
It just means I've been here a lot longer...
How did you know I was lying?
What do you mean "less is more"? Where the hell am I?
On size fits all, my ass!
This is nothing. You should see the Boss's mancave.
Bigger is better for men . . . on Earth, as it is in Heaven!
. . . then I said, 'who is Kim Kardashian?'.
And I was like, "OMG, is that really, you?", and he was like, "DUDE, totally righteous!"
Do you think I was born dead yesterday? I've seen Pinocchio!
'Can we skip the obvious penis joke please?" ' "Can we skip the obvious penis joke please?"
Its herniated; and my personal care doctor has been cast out of network.
Lord knows, I am ready to downsize.
Hot yoga, baby!
Is that a pizza on your head or are you just glad to see me?
But last time I asked you said, "Not a chance in Hell!"
You need better proof?
It's the new iHalo7.
...and you should have seen my Porsche.
It is sort of like the size of your hands
...So then I died in a fire at the Wham-O factory.
I guess the rules are different up here, but down there I was considered an angel for not hitting on every woman
The Super-sized version accommodates one's ego.
I'm a Republican but I voted for Hillary.
You'te gonna need a bigger halo.
It's simple, the male ego is bigger!
Welcome to heaven as it is on earth.
Until death do us part?
It's a risk.
Unfortunately it is really heavy.
Don't let this fool you, I am quite the bad boy.
You have incredible tips!
I rather enjoy being thought of as larger than life.
You know what they say about guys with big halos, don't you.
It used to fit better, before the diet.
Could we at least lie in neighboring bath tubs?
It's not the size of the halo, it's what you do with it.
They ran out of mediums and smalls.
With halos, it's who you know Cindy
How unfortunate we did not meet under different circumstances!!!
Sorry, but I got this as a reward for my vow of eternal chastity.
Because She likes me better than you.
After looking at your robe, maybe my halo shouldn't be as large as it appears.
Actually it's kind of embarrassing. I almost wish I hadn't cured cancer.
That's not the only thing that's big.
Yes, I’ve been working out.
I'll bet your wondering how good I've been.
You get it when you reach Platinum Level.
It's not mine, I fell through it

Unbeknownst to Tom, while he was playing hard to get, his halo was giving him away.
It's LED, it uses less energy.
Well, yeah, and I have big hands, too - really big hands!
It's not a hoola hoop.
This halo would be shrinking, if He knew what I was thinking!!
But Gabriel, I can't find my sword anywhere.
I love an USA without terrorist attacks and gun violence.” “So do I.
Once I resisted the temptation to leave a comment.
It seems the Viagra Effect goes to your head up here.
I guess they went by the size of my hands.
I was a Democrat.
I opted for the "holier than thou" feature.
I never told a lie.
Heaven hath no joy like a woman scorned.
Ohhh . . . my . . . God!
I don't show this to just anybody.
I havn't done a lot since you dumped me in high school
It's a continuation of the gender pay gap.
It's been like this for over four hours. Do you think I should consult my doctor?
You can"t hula hoop with that size.
So now I know what happens when an erection lasts longer than four hours.
Hello, I'm Johnny Angel, and together we will see how lovely heaven can be.
Too bad Date Night is many moons away
But didn't you say size doesn't matter?

Sorry, sometimes I get excited too easily
Angie greets her Rodeo husband in Heaven
Why do you say that I think I'm holier than thou?
I do indeed find you quite attractive. What tipped you off?
I demanded the expanded version of humility.
Mine is an affect
You thought it would be different here?
Gender quality? That's for humans, not for us, sweet heart!
I don't think size really matters here.
I should not brag but the bigger the halo., the bigger the...what was it called again?
You are not the only one who thought that the cumulus cloud cover would represent a more level playing field.
Size doesn't matter up here, if you get my drift.
It turns out that size DOES matter.
Believe me, Angelica. Size really DOES matter.
Everything matches, believe me!
Heaven is just like earth but with better climate.
I guess you weren't being passive aggressive after all.
Yup, large halo means large....

Extra credit for rejecting campaign contributions from the gun lobby.
Where have you been all my life?
I got into a prank war with the apostles, and now I'm bumping halos with everyone.
I think it's because of my "holier than thou" attitude.
Yes, I am happy to see you, but the size of my halo has nothing to do with that.
Viagra? No. Why do you ask?
Small, yes, but with a great view.
Rub yours, it will get bigger, too.
Baby, you're no angel and neither am I

Hula-hoop accident giving a demo at an orphanage.
Equal halos!? Where do you think you are... Utopia?
Actually I bought it from His Holiness...
In heaven, you see, we get to keep our favorite girl, trade in our orange hair, forget all the stupid things we ever said, and still be on top.
I agree, equal halos for equal good deeds!
Yeah, rumors are swirling that it's to compensate for other things. Not true.
Actually, Janice, size *does* matter.
I know what you're thinking. Not bad for a guy with such tiny hands, huh?
I think because it helps balance out my extreme shoe size?
How did I do It? Simple. Stay out of politics, away from the stock market, and eat all my vegetables.
Did I mention there's a Hula competition up here?
It is just the right size to double as a hula hoop.
Do we need to take our halos off too?

Heavens yes, size does count.
That's the problem, you think bigger is always better.
I guess it means I'm holier than thou.
I knew I would get a greater reward than you...........
Your's is not even 71% as big as mine.
Yes I know. You're impressed. Lifelong virginity is quite the accomplishment.
well it is my birthday.
White male privilege has nothing to do with it. I am just holier than you, God says so.
I am NOT trying to over compensate.
You're right, from the 1%.
Just keep it low profile. It is difficult at first, but you'll get used to it.
Not to be halo-ey er than thou, but...
This is not what I meant when I prayed to become well endowed.
Since we live forever, it just keeps getting bigger. Kinda like our ears before we died.

When I behold your beauty , I can't control myself.
I received this for not watching Adam and Eve's escapades.

It's not an invisible ceiling that will prevent you from rising in the angelic ranks; it merely indicates that yours is a more focused spirituality.
I had a Groupon for it.
Wow I still feel it, the desire to touch, my halo is swelling.
You know, this halo is anatomically correct.
I thought it would be different in heaven, thanks be to God!
There's room for one more.
Good luck at ring toss, I'm off to hula hooping.

Sorry I'm late, I was having sudden misgivings on murder-suicide.
So, uh, do you come to this cloud often?
My twin brother was a huge jerk.
If this doesn't prove to you that size really matters, nothing will!
Curiously, size matters, even here.
Yeah, well you know how it is. Some girls just go a little overboard with the ratings.
Is it true what they say about Halo size?
For a few extra good deeds I was able to super size it.
It must have something to do with what we were doing when we did it.
You weren't offered the extended coverage option?
Well, yes, it's true what they say about men with big halos.
If it last longer than 4 hours, I'm supposed to contact my theologian right away.
