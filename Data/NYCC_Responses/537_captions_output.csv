He said the patent expired
He says the guy with the original idea never took out a patent!
He is making a life preserver for my Mother.
I hope he discovers fire soon. Dinner is at six.
He told me that the patent expired.
There, that's as close to a perfect square as I can get it.
I don't have the heart to tell him it's been done.
He 'fears' something might happen to me soon that will send him to prison; so he's learning to use a rock hammer.
It came today but we ordered it ages ago.
The hole in the middle was my idea.
Turns out it was never patented.
I don't want to break his heart.
I don't have the heart to tell him.
It's been in our family for 12,000 years.
Douglas just got his Mechanical Engineering Degree from Trump University!
It would break his heart if I told him it had been done already.
I'm letting the Patent Office tell him.
When he's done I'm going to reinvent the divorce.
Well, I laughed at him too, but turns out Bruce is the first to actually apply for a patent.
He's not reinventing it, he's making it great again.
His influences are Brancusi, Warhol, and Krispy Kreme.
Harry got some discouraging news from the Patent Office this morning.
Try to look surprised.
It was supposed to be a square, but he kept cutting corners.
He's rethinking his choice of font.
I've got an inkling I'm getting a big rock for our anniversary.
I hid the instructions.
For me, it's a lifesaver.
...but the worst of it is, in bed he calls me Wilma.
That's not the Big O I was thinking of.
Yes, he's been working on it for over three weeks now. I don't have the heart to tell him it's already been done.
Would you like to buy a Vowel?
He asks me, “What kind of ring?” I said, “Just buy the biggest rock you can find.”
Well he did ask what type of ring I wanted and I said "as long as it's a big stone"
My first husband invented fire.
Yeah, I know. But I don't have the heart to tell him.
We looked it up. Nobody has a patent on it.
I would prefer he had reinvented himself.
He said he's making me a flotation device.
I don't have the heart to tell him he's an idiot.
Care to buy a vowel?
Trust me, this one will gather moss.
No, I'm not surprised. He once wrote a poem called 'The Road Already Taken'.
He's practicing in case he has to restart civilization after a Trump presidency.
Keeping him busy has been a big lifesaver.
The other vowels are in the den.
I wish Bob would see a doctor about his enlarged vowels.
I wish he'd put as much energy into reinventing foreplay.
His ex got the X.
I thought "N" was his best work.
He makes them in peppermint, spearmint and wild cherry.
I don't have the heart to tell him it's already been done.
I'm actually looking forward to the start of football season.
At least yours is a functioning Neanderthal.
He also thinks he invented the internet
He's so proud. I haven't told him yet.
He studied creativity at Trump University.
He's got big ideas . . . apparently the guy who invented it never bothered to file a patent.
I'd rather he reinvented himself.
15 years with Bob and I have zero to show for it.
Jan, I swear it's like he'd rather reinvent the wheel than find my clitoris.
The rest of the alphabet is in the basement.
Sorry the coffee's cold—he hasn't discovered fire yet.
I asked him to make my mom a new toilet seat.
He's been promising me the "Big O" for years.
I haven’t had the heart to tell him.
When he gets to Z, I'm out of here.
I'll let the Patent Office provide the disappointment.
He finally made a hole in one.
He's got his nose to the grindstone, shoulder to the wheel, and head up his butt.
It's the fourth piece in Bob's "I'd Like to Buy a Vowel" series.
He conceptualized it as a number, but he's experiencing it as a letter.
He's literally 5,000 years behind on his to-do list.
Maybe he didn't invent it, but the Guggenheim is interested.
That wasn't the "Big O" I had in mind.
I don't have the heart to break it to him.
Big shoes to fill. His dad discovered fire.
Well, Marlene, "paleo" isn't just a diet; it's a way of life.
He's also making a square peg.
Oh, it's nothing.
It keeps him busy, but I have no idea where we're going to put the rest of the alphabet.

Assuming all goes well at the patent office, we'll be set for life.

I'm so excited! Bob said I was going to get the big "O" tonight!!
Yes, and I'm about to re-invent a divorce lawyer.
When he asked about a ring, I told him I wanted a big rock.
When he discovers fire, then I'll worry.
I had a different Big O in mind.
When his Tinder profile said 'early man,' I though it meant he was punctual.
Not exactly what I meant by the big O.
I haven't got the heart to tell him
In his personal ad he mentioned that he wanted to reinvent the wheel - my mistake was to think he had a sense of humor.
Only two F's to go and our neighbours should get the hint.
Who knew that it had never been patented?
When I ask what he's working on, he says "nothing".
Sometimes I wish he would just gather moss.
I just feel like evolution is something that happens to other women's husbands.
He says he's had it with cubism.
I'm sorry about dinner. He hasn't discovered fire yet.
I just tell myself, he could be attending a Trump rally.
I'd also like an R, G, A, S and M one of these days.
I asked him to give me a concrete example of good circular reasoning.
Whenever I ask him what he's making, he tells me, 'Nothing.'
The hardest part is making it minty
It all began when we started the Paleo Diet.
My mother predicted he would turn out to be a chiseler.
Last week it was fire, so I'm fine with this.
But does it gather moss?
Humor him. Just say: Wheel? What's a wheel?
He's always cutting corners.
His last work was entitled "Square Peg".
Wanna buy a vowel.
I told Stanley I've been waiting 23 years for the "Big O.
It's a millstone. Dan's making it for our anniversary.
I've grown. Frank is stuck in the past.
He works in the house now. Last week he invented fire and burned down the garage.
I would have preferred he reinvent himself.
It's the emptiness inside that defines his work.
It’s not the fact that he keeps reinventing the wheel that bothers me. It’s his literal interpretation of idioms. Last week he tried to kill our cat with curiosity.
He's a binary thinker.
He's three wheels short in a lot of ways.
I don't have the heart to tell him Obama can't serve a third term.
He says it's not about being the first, it's about being the best.
You should see the car.
I know, and he still uses a Blackberry!
He's voting for Trump and preparing for the stone age.
Just say no if he asks to play tic-tac-toe.
The Guggenheim said, They already have one.
He's combined his lack of imagination with sculpting now.
I'm so excited! He's been dropping hints about a ring for weeks!
It's not exactly the "big O" I asked him for.
The Met is interested. And Michelin.

For our anniversary he promised me a big ring.
It's the "O" in O.C.D

Needless to say, the patent lawyers are not returning his calls.
I've decided just to roll with it.
I'm hoping that next he'll reinvent foreplay.

It took him longer than he thought it would to carve "Obama for President."
It means nothing to me.

He says he's finally going to give me 'the big O'.
It looked different at Ikea.
I mentioned to him I wanted a big ring.
Oh, it's nothing really.
Thank God it's all downhill from here.
That man hasn't had an original idea in his life.
What he says is, "yes it's been invented, but never perfected"
He can find the time to reinvent the wheel, but ask him to take out the garbage...
Three more and we can go on vacation.
So I said to him, "Herb, what part of NO don't you understand." He's just been standing there ever since.
He calls it 'Cerealism'.
I think Frank misunderstood what I meant when I said that I was looking for 'the big O'.
Harry's actually quite talented; he's just not particularly original.
Frankly, when he said he was going to give me 'the big O' I had something else in mind.
His latest work is a reflection on how much money he makes as an artist.
It wasn't the 'big rock' I was hoping for, but yes, we're engaged.
The wifi has been out all week.
I wish he would reinvent an addition to our kitchen.

It was supposed to be a Q.
Herbert's art has come full circle.

His hobby is a lifesaver.
That's not the "Big O" I was hoping for.
It's part of the settlement with Volkswagen

He's been secretive but promised a ring with a sizable rock.
Tomorrow's our anniversary and I've been hinting for a ring with a big rock.
He thinks maybe it's never been patented.
It's competitive with him; his brother invented the axle.
Please don't tell him. I've never seen him so happy.
I think he misunderstood me when I told him I wanted the big 'O'.
... and then he said " I'll show you what a real millstone looks like", and he's been at it ever since.
It's the first "O" I've had in this house since we got married.
He is still trying to figure out which way to hang it.
Frankly I find his artwork derivative.
Don't be too impressed, it's sculpt-by-number.
I had him bronzed; he's part of the sculpture.
He's just worried about it gathering moss.
I'm sure next time you'll be able to spot our address.
He's convinced that no one ever filed the patent.
To be fair, I wasn't specific when I asked him for a Big O.
He obviously misunderstood me when I told him to give me the big "O".
He's convinced everyone's trying to steal his idea.
By the time he's finished, someone else will have thought of it.
It looked smaller on Amazon.
I keep telling him, 3.14, 3.15 - what's the difference!?

I know it's old-fashioned, but he decided to send a letter.
He's making an inner tube for my mother.
His previous project was a square peg.

I'm getting the big "O" for my birthday!

He loves his Rolling Stones.
My husband's an inventor, he's just not very good.
He won't let me see it yet, but he says it eloquently sums up his entire career.
I asked him to install the washer.
I think it's all for naught.
Oh, it's not unusual. All men are chiselers.
I prefer the term 'redundantly creative'.
Are you in the market for a vowel?
... and then he said 'Just because it's been done before doesn't mean it was done RIGHT!'
Last week it was sliced bread.
He's been trying to figure out how to make an X.
We're getting a head start for the post election world
This hobby has been a lifesaver for him.
Then one day, he had an epiphany: quit the donut business and pursue his art.
Maureen, just be happy he isn't reinventing fire.
Fire is next on his list.

Only 11 more letters to go!
I guess you could say he finally gave me one
His father only worked in consonants.
His new stuff is very retro.
Last week he rediscovered fire.
Another breakthrough from the man cave.
He calls it rock and roll.
He says the ones in the store are overpriced.
When he said he wanted a man cave, I imagined something a little different.
The first fourteen letters were no problem.
Last week he attached a string to two tin cans.
Personally, I think he's taking the 'man cave' thing a little too far.
I just wish he could reinvent our marriage.

You should see his cave paintings.
He was so square when I met him.
He said everyone talks about it but nobody does it.
Jim's an inventor, but he was born behind his time.
Seriously, Betty, it's like living with a neanderthal.

He's still stuck on "some assembly required."

I know, but this one is self-driving.
But then I thought, he's happy, don't spoil it. It could have been fire.
Lately I think he been taking me for granite.
When he finishes the second stone and the windmill, we'll be able to grind our own corn.
I keep waiting for him to reinvent himself.
He just woke up one morning and said, "Darn it, I'm going to build my first mobile app!"
I wanted a ring with a big stone!
Wait till you see the rest of the car…
He figured it would be easier than reinventing himself.
He loves his vintage car, but it's hard to get parts.
We reinvent things we don't need, with money we don't have, to impress people we don't like.
What a lifesaver
I had no idea your husband was such a huge fan of Classic Rock.

I think the real challenge for him will be the square pegs.
I wish he would reinvent himself instead.
Yes, Papa is a rolling stone.
He thinks he can beat me at tic tac toe but I've got a giant 'X' in the garage.
Too bad he never reinvents himself.
It's an interpretive work exploring his income as a sculptor.
Boredom is the mother of reinvention.
Why tell him it's been done already. It's kept him out of my way for weeks now.
Yes, there are some side effects to the Paleo diet.
The problem is, it's supposed to be jelly filled.

I told him the ring needs to be huge. I'm sure he got the idea.
You really need to tell him Obama's not running again.
The sprinkles keep falling off.
Well I like it. Don't be such a square, Peg.
It's been days and he still can't decide. Plain or frosted?
His next piece will be a square peg.
He's also working on something he calls 'fire'.
His start-up failed, so I guess it is back to the grindstone.
I told Frank I wanted a big "O".
I'm hoping he'll eventually move on to sliced bread.
For our anniversary he promised to give me the big "O".
It's an "o" and it's big, but it's not really what I had in mind.
As soon as he gets around to inventing fire, I'll put the roast in the oven.
I'm serious--we desperately need to sell a vowel!

It's not going well, Helen. I told Harry I am leaving if he can't give me the big "O".
Honey, have you seen the square peg?
Fred has never been very good with faces.
It's an homage to breakfast cereals of his boyhood.
I know. He says his is better.
He works for a startup.
He has a tech startup for Luddites.
Lately, I get the definite sense that he's coming toward the end of his vowel period.
In my opinion, his mousetrap was better.
It feels like he has been working on it for 5,000 years.
Cheerios…donuts… washers…Who knows how men think?
Well on the dating site he described himself as well chiseled.
Great," I said. "What's next, fire?
Just wait till you see the "BAMA."

No one’s had the heart to tell him.
Why couldn’t he just reinvent HIMSELF?
Where's Bob? I sent him out to pick up some milk.
He also invented the internet.
You're lucky. My husband has never given me a Big O.
Sorry for the cold tea- he hasn't discovered fire yet.
It's nice to see he's good with his hands, but have you told him that's not 'The Big O' you were talking about?
I just don't have the heart to tell him.
All that he has left is to decide which side is the front.
Someone else is going to have to tell him he's not the first.
All I asked him was for the latest "Rolling Stone."
You should see the size of the coffee cup.
Ed finally agreed to get me a bigger washer.
He has three more just like it.
He's worked so hard, I don't have the heart to tell him it's been done before.
It's a giant washer,and he's the nut.
I'm hoping he reinvents his career next.
He misunderstood when I asked for the big "o".
He's determined to make something out of nothing
Unfortunately, it's exactly what I asked for.
It's the first of a series.

You should see the size of the wheelbarrow.

It all started after he traced his family tree back to the Stone Age.
He says it represents the emptiness at the center of the modern world and our marriage surrounded by the constructivist retro oppressiveness of antiquity and our debts.
He has a degree in reverse engineering.
Hey, honey, do we have any cream cheese?
Paleo isn't just a diet. It's a lifestyle.
We figured we’d save some money with a super jumbo toilet paper roll from Costco. It’s supposed to last two years . . . if we can ever figure out how to get it into the bathroom.
The patent office has been giving him the run around.
His last hobby was politics. This seems more productive.
Our last one went flat.
Walter only has seventeen cliches left on his bucket list.
I told him, 'We needed new tires like 5,000 years ago.' He's so literal.
He's been on the paleo diet for 2 years now. There have been some side-effects.
After he invented fire there was no stopping him!
He Calls it-"Life Saver"
I don't have to cook dinner until he reinvents fire.
It's Edgar's homage to our savings account rate.
I think he misunderstood when I told him to work on giving me the big O.
It's his way of rebelling against Cubism.
That's not "The Big O" I meant...
If he starts making a square peg, I'm leaving him.
It’s not that bad. My husband is obsessed with winning a caption contest.
I wish Fred knew where to find the G.

I just wish he'd stop saying 'Cheerio' when he finishes one.
It's only rock 'n' roll but he likes it.
One day he just said "screw Times New Roman" and it's been Helvetica ever since.
It's my fault really; the other night in bed, I asked him to give me one.
He said it would be something that is neither negative nor positive.
You should see his coffee mug
It's a sculpture that sums up his life
Before applying for a patent I think he should at least google it.
I think he has a big axe to grind.
If only he could reinvent himself.
At least it's not fire, again.
I know, I know. I just don't have the heart to tell him.
He always wanted a standing O
Sometimes he can be such a neanderthal.
At least he's stopped trying to discover fire.
If you ask me he's taking the whole "man cave" thing a little too literally.
He says it's easier than reinventing himself.
So I say "Harold, you can't reinvent the wheel." He took it as a challenge.
Lisa. . . they are all cavemen at some level.
His Papa was a rolling stone.

I wish he'd spend more time trying to reinvent himself.
And tomorrow we get fire!
It's a self-portrait.
That's NOT what I meant when I said he'd never given me the big 'O'.
It's his move in tic-tac-toe.
Originally it was square, but he couldn't get it out of the house.
High percentage of neanderthal DNA.
The paleo diet has changed our whole lifestyle.
First, it was just the Paleo diet.
It was this, or couple's counseling. -He always takes the easier way out.
It's his first attempt at a square.
I wish he'd rediscover the romance instead.
You should see the extra large coffee he carved to go with it.
What’s worse, he still uses headphones with a wire.
It's been a while since I've had an "O" in the bedroom.
It's not so much a reinvention as a reinterpretation.
That's my husband; always trying to re-invent the wheel.
Who would have thought it'd be a lifesaver?
He can't stop cutting corners.
It all started when he gave up gluten.
His new hobby has been a real life saver.
I rue the day he started watching the History Channel.
He just can't decide what to call it.
I don't have the heart to tell him someone's already thought of it.
I call it the agony and the agony.
It's complicated.
We’re designing our own rings.
With the divorce finalized, I got it removed from my neck.
I say, 'You're just reinventing the wheel'. He says, 'Exactly'. We haven't spoken since.
I think he's about to transition into his 'p' period.
It started out a sculpture, now he's just trying to get it out of the house.
