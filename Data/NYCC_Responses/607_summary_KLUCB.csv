7762,3635,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,607,Is this considered deadpan or irony?
7708,3635,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,607,I warned him not to take on the IRS. The only thing more certain than Death is Taxes.
7412,3635,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,607,Does this mean we can cancel our supplemental insurance?
3633,3635,7,7,66,80,1.2625,0.06830624913495159,607,It’s grim alright.
7011,3635,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,607,My brother was always the life of the party.
6972,3635,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,607,It killed him that the A-15 was more efficient.
6971,3635,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,607,"Well, Dear, looks as though he went down reaping, at least."
6851,3635,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,607,It’s not really surprising...death becomes him.
6847,3635,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,607,He’s just getting a feel for it.
5700,3635,1,19,60,80,1.2625,0.05260237155937825,607,Can't wait to see HIS epitaph.
6831,3635,2,17,61,80,1.2625,0.05552895811982625,607,I told him he should have retired earlier.
6535,3635,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,607,Well he can't take that scythe with him.
6405,3635,5,11,64,80,1.2625,0.06350458470442125,607,Let's call the accountant make sure we need to file this year.
6384,3635,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,607,It looks grim
6360,3635,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,607,I really wish I didn’t buy that funeral home.
6331,3635,6,9,65,80,1.2625,0.06594913172046729,607,"""My worst nightmare has come true.We're going to outlive our money""."
6326,3635,2,17,61,80,1.2625,0.05552895811982625,607,Now that Death is dead I want a divorce.
6314,3635,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,607,"Well, he never did take a holiday."
6271,3635,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,607,He makes it look so easy.
6157,3635,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,607,It was the grimmest of funerals
6129,3635,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,607,"Uh-oh, how are we gonna stretch our nest-egg into forever?"
6739,3635,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,607,I guess it's our last one of these for a while.
3616,3635,2,17,61,80,1.2625,0.05552895811982625,607,I'm cancelling our burial plan.
6323,3635,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,607,we may have to rethink whether or not our retirement savings are still sufficient
3604,3635,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,607,This explains why we saw so little of Charlie on the weekends.
1473,3635,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,607,I'd know that face anywhere. It's the Grim Sleeper!
1363,3635,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,607,"After the tax bill, this was inevitable."
1180,3635,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,607,He always seemed depressed
1162,3635,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,607,"No, that is not the true definition of 'ironic.'"
1151,3635,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,607,"Sorry dear, but after this our funeral home is going kaput."
1143,3635,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,607,I didn't even know he was sickle.
1128,3635,6,9,65,80,1.2625,0.06594913172046729,607,That was Harry's favorite Halloween costume.
1062,3635,5,11,64,80,1.2625,0.06350458470442125,607,. . . only thing left now is taxes.
1032,3635,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,607,I wonder if he has to pay the death tax.
972,3635,7,7,66,80,1.2625,0.06830624913495159,607,I told him not to touch himself.
1582,3635,2,17,61,80,1.2625,0.05552895811982625,607,He took his own death.
911,3635,6,9,65,80,1.2625,0.06594913172046729,607,"Karma's a bitch, ain't it?"
771,3635,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,607,"What a tragedy, and just before tax day."
765,3635,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,607,He believed in his product.
720,3635,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,607,My Harold. He was such a people person.
701,3635,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,607,Don't ask. My brother always had a strange sense of humor.
586,3635,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,607,"His final words were ""I've been cheated for the last time!"""
531,3635,5,11,64,80,1.2625,0.06350458470442125,607,He looks so death-like lying there.
520,3635,2,17,61,80,1.2625,0.05552895811982625,607,He died doing his job. Just like I knew he would.
485,3635,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,607,I never thought he would be the first to go.
222,3635,6,9,65,80,1.2625,0.06594913172046729,607,It's been ruled a suicide.
156,3635,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,607,Death becomes her.
876,3635,5,11,64,80,1.2625,0.06350458470442125,607,"I know it's the most luxurious coffin ever built, but we cannot afford to keep the place if you don't get back to work!"
1829,3635,2,17,61,80,1.2625,0.05552895811982625,607,"To be honest, I really had my hopes on “till death do us part”..."
1676,3635,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,607,He didn't get his flu shot.
2812,3635,6,9,65,80,1.2625,0.06594913172046729,607,He's scared to death of Trump's presidency
3505,3635,5,11,64,80,1.2625,0.06350458470442125,607,"Hey Reaper, wake up! You got unfinished business here."
3355,3635,6,9,65,80,1.2625,0.06594913172046729,607,He forgot to ask for eternal life.
3337,3635,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,607,I guess I'll renew my subscription to the Times.
3326,3635,5,11,64,80,1.2625,0.06350458470442125,607,I heard he wasn't prepared for the repeal of death taxes.
3319,3635,2,17,61,80,1.2625,0.05552895811982625,607,"So does this mean we're definitely going to die, or that we'll never die?"
3264,3635,5,11,64,80,1.2625,0.06350458470442125,607,I wonder how Billy Graham would have explained this.
3239,3635,2,17,61,80,1.2625,0.05552895811982625,607,I thought he was already dead !
3200,3635,6,9,65,80,1.2625,0.06594913172046729,607,Apparently he was an Eagles fan.
1842,3635,1,19,60,80,1.2625,0.05260237155937825,607,He affected so many lives.
60,3635,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,607,I'm glad they went with the robe. It's all anyone ever saw him in.
2675,3635,2,17,61,80,1.2625,0.05552895811982625,607,I guess we should have bought that long-term health care policy.
2639,3635,2,17,61,80,1.2625,0.05552895811982625,607,We were friends on Facebook.
2509,3635,1,19,60,80,1.2625,0.05260237155937825,607,"The good news Martha, we can now live forever... the bad news? We have enough money for about five more years."
2457,3635,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,607,Does this mean I can stop taking my blood pressure pills?
2399,3635,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,607,I told you not to pre-pay for your funeral.
2131,3635,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,607,Is this the end of life as we know it?
2062,3635,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,607,"O death, where is thy sting?"
3607,3635,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,607,He was such a good guy
1984,3635,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,607,I was hoping not to live through this presidency.
1976,3635,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,607,Someone finally scared Death to death.
3509,3635,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,607,I see they went for the Classic Majesty model. Someone must have loved him.
3576,3635,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,607,Look at that! Even Death had a rendezvous.

615,3734,3,16,65,84,1.2619047619047619,0.05647680289606312,607,I knew his commitment to the role would mean the end.
354,3734,5,12,67,84,1.2619047619047619,0.06134617127947345,607,oh fuck yes

1760,3743,3,15,63,81,1.2592592592592593,0.057675598157027524,607,These open coffins will be the death of me.

606,3743,4,13,64,81,1.2592592592592593,0.0602919281337026,607,He looks so content. Usually he is pretty grim.
287,3743,4,13,64,81,1.2592592592592593,0.0602919281337026,607,Time to revisit our retirement planning assumptions.

6932,3950,3,13,60,76,1.25,0.05960395606792697,607,Maybe we should’ve seen it coming.
6798,3950,3,13,60,76,1.25,0.05960395606792697,607,"Well, that’s that!"
6675,3950,4,11,61,76,1.25,0.06247806632675042,607,He looks really grim.
6643,3950,3,13,60,76,1.25,0.05960395606792697,607,"I always told him, ""he who lives by the scythe, dies by the scythe"""
6639,3950,2,15,59,76,1.25,0.056584047097789955,607,"Well, I don't know what this means for the rest of us, but I certainly see the irony."
6617,3950,3,13,60,76,1.25,0.05960395606792697,607,I never thought he'd be the first to go.
6417,3950,4,11,61,76,1.25,0.06247806632675042,607,His accomplishments were breathtaking.
6266,3950,2,15,59,76,1.25,0.056584047097789955,607,"Turn about, fair play."
6139,3950,3,13,60,76,1.25,0.05960395606792697,607,Maybe a working vacation but I knew that he couldn't handle a holiday.
6130,3950,4,11,61,76,1.25,0.06247806632675042,607,I don't think most people really understood him.
6035,3950,2,16,62,80,1.25,0.05483000195079379,607,Our retirement fund does NOT account for this!
4569,3950,4,12,64,80,1.25,0.060326117945124845,607,Dang. That's pretty ironic isn't it?
3606,3950,2,15,59,76,1.25,0.056584047097789955,607,This isn't the first time we've cheated death.
4504,3950,4,11,61,76,1.25,0.06247806632675042,607,I didn’t think he would EVER die!
2318,3950,3,14,63,80,1.25,0.05764360164082899,607,"So grim, it's like he's still with us."
2179,3950,0,19,57,76,1.25,0.05,607,"Well, that’s about as dead dead can be."
2004,3950,4,11,61,76,1.25,0.06247806632675042,607,"I knew he was sick, but a SICKle in his coffin is overkill."
1981,3950,2,15,59,76,1.25,0.056584047097789955,607,I wonder if now we will live forever ?
1894,3950,2,15,59,76,1.25,0.056584047097789955,607,"I know he carried that scythe everywhere he went, but would it have killed them to put a suit and tie on him instead?"
1888,3950,3,13,60,76,1.25,0.05960395606792697,607,"Is it just me or does Fred look like ""death warmed over""?"
1827,3950,5,10,65,80,1.25,0.06289432567832845,607,"Well, on the bright side, at least we still have taxes."
1778,3950,4,12,64,80,1.25,0.060326117945124845,607,So does this mean we're immortal now?
1772,3950,3,13,60,76,1.25,0.05960395606792697,607,There goes your mother's insurance.
2506,3950,2,15,59,76,1.25,0.056584047097789955,607,Who knew
1752,3950,5,9,62,76,1.25,0.0652256541930572,607,They say he worked himself to death.
1452,3950,3,13,60,76,1.25,0.05960395606792697,607,I wondered why he was late to see us.
1071,3950,4,11,61,76,1.25,0.06247806632675042,607,I suppose taxes can't be avoided either.
1049,3950,2,15,59,76,1.25,0.056584047097789955,607,Gluten is the real killer here
974,3950,4,12,64,80,1.25,0.060326117945124845,607,"Another Casualty of ""Me Too""..."
793,3950,1,16,55,72,1.25,0.05506433852460047,607,I thought he was joking.
705,3950,4,11,61,76,1.25,0.06247806632675042,607,"Oh my, how are they going to close the casket?"
513,3950,4,11,61,76,1.25,0.06247806632675042,607,I guess his karma finally caught up with him.
458,3950,1,17,58,76,1.25,0.05339360629309896,607,"""You reap what you sow"" doesn't quite say it."
397,3950,5,9,62,76,1.25,0.0652256541930572,607,He looks so peaceful.
1561,3950,5,9,62,76,1.25,0.0652256541930572,607,I guess this is the last of the grim reaper cartoons in the New Yorker!
2617,3950,6,7,63,76,1.25,0.06786208925382961,607,Suicide! He couldn’t handle being out-grimmed by the Trump Administration.
2647,3950,2,15,59,76,1.25,0.056584047097789955,607,I can't choose between ironic or oxymoronic.
2727,3950,2,15,59,76,1.25,0.056584047097789955,607,It had to happen. The only thing certain and all that.
4462,3950,2,15,59,76,1.25,0.056584047097789955,607,Herb always had a good sense of humor.
4441,3950,1,17,58,76,1.25,0.05339360629309896,607,I guess we’ll never really know death
4419,3950,4,10,58,72,1.25,0.06485206471146153,607,He always was a little grim.
4393,3950,6,7,63,76,1.25,0.06786208925382961,607,I did NOT see that coming.
4289,3950,3,13,60,76,1.25,0.05960395606792697,607,HE WOULD LOOK BETTER WITH HIS HEAD ATTACHED.
4094,3950,1,17,58,76,1.25,0.05339360629309896,607,he looks a bit pale
4027,3950,4,11,61,76,1.25,0.06247806632675042,607,Turns out you CAN take it with you!
4015,3950,4,11,61,76,1.25,0.06247806632675042,607,Kind of ironic that a Jewish carpenter did him in with a nail.
4007,3950,2,15,59,76,1.25,0.056584047097789955,607,"Wake up, son! I know you're tired, but Congress has decided to ignore gun control issues until after the midterms."
3917,3950,4,11,61,76,1.25,0.06247806632675042,607,"Our poor, poor boy. Even in death he doesn't fit in."
3877,3950,4,11,61,76,1.25,0.06247806632675042,607,"Herb, did he ever look sickel to you?"
3642,3950,3,13,60,76,1.25,0.05960395606792697,607,You'd think he would have known he can't take it with him.
4538,3950,1,17,58,76,1.25,0.05339360629309896,607,- and yet he still looks so grim and reaper-like!
3584,3950,3,13,60,76,1.25,0.05960395606792697,607,He was dying to be here
3522,3950,4,11,61,76,1.25,0.06247806632675042,607,I knew we should have bought a bigger casket.
3413,3950,3,13,60,76,1.25,0.05960395606792697,607,Well.... happens to the best of us.
3290,3950,4,11,61,76,1.25,0.06247806632675042,607,There goes our Medicare.
3250,3950,4,11,61,76,1.25,0.06247806632675042,607,"John Donne said it would happen, but I never thought I'd actually see it."
3241,3950,1,17,58,76,1.25,0.05339360629309896,607,Maury always said he was knocking on deaths door.
3100,3950,3,13,60,76,1.25,0.05960395606792697,607,"Mortimer, this is fake news in three dimensions"

179,3950,4,11,61,76,1.25,0.06247806632675042,607,"Did he say ""I'll be back""?"

4470,4656,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,607,I guess it's true that no one lasts forever.

7217,4656,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,607,He should not have attempted to take the scythe of the Unmaker.

7386,4656,5,5,57,67,1.2238805970149254,0.0699579751164994,607,One too many funerals

7643,4656,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,607,I told him the bio-tech industry would be the death of him.
7711,4656,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,607,I 'm confused. Why are we here?
7719,4656,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,607,He wanted a closed casket because he was tired of alwways looking death in the face.
4580,4656,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,607,He lived such a good life.
3782,4656,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,607,Done.
7780,4656,1,13,53,67,1.2238805970149254,0.055542615574947524,607,I know you thought he was one of the immortals. But people change.
7759,4656,0,15,52,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05130982469793496,607,I guess you reap what you sow. Even if what you sow is that you reaped.
7734,4656,1,13,53,67,1.2238805970149254,0.055542615574947524,607,"Obviously, he's new at this."
7811,4656,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,607,RATS! I told you not to cancel our longterm-care coverage!
7082,4656,4,7,56,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06664708731840546,607,So this is what the end of death looks like.
7075,4656,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,607,He always took DIY too seriously.

5921,4656,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,607,I'm glad. He was worse than a plague.
5925,4656,4,7,56,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06664708731840546,607,We all knew that suicide would take him.

6075,4656,1,13,53,67,1.2238805970149254,0.055542615574947524,607,What kind of schmuck would dress like that for a funeral?
6109,4656,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,607,We reap what we sow...

6324,4656,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,607,"How many times have I told him, one scythe does not fit all?"
6387,4656,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,607,I understand that his son has now taken over the business.

6822,4656,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,607,I guess he just couldn’t compete with the App.
5838,4656,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,607,"Nice work, but this is going to hurt business...."

6545,4656,1,13,53,67,1.2238805970149254,0.055542615574947524,607,I told him to stay off the pale horse.

3743,4656,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,607,I tried to tell him he couldn't outlive Larry King.
6038,4656,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,607,"Soooo, does this mean we have to live forever?!?"

1252,4656,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,607,I told him it was a job with no future.
1296,4656,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,607,His last wish was for me to file his tax returns.

1342,4656,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,607,A bit morbid if you ask me.
1345,4656,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,607,I tried to warn him. Nobody puts Baby in the corner!

5660,5388,1,10,49,60,1.2,0.057243656051933725,607,He is so much better looking in person.
5788,5388,1,10,49,60,1.2,0.057243656051933725,607,Now can we take a vacation?
5840,5388,3,6,51,60,1.2,0.06638357975446148,607,Does this mean I have to stay alive?

5888,5388,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,607,So now we live forever?
5936,5388,0,12,48,60,1.2,0.052075564392329535,607,"Wow, the Grim Reaper's performance art has gotten pretty meta."
5957,5388,3,6,51,60,1.2,0.06638357975446148,607,It was a brutal ending but I had to do something about your escalating life insurance costs.
6031,5388,1,10,49,60,1.2,0.057243656051933725,607,He died doing what he loved. Death.
6224,5388,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,607,You just expect her to get up any minute.
6454,5388,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,607,I didn't think he took it so seriously.
6539,5388,0,12,48,60,1.2,0.052075564392329535,607,Told you those chess classes would be worth it.
6544,5388,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,607,What happened?” “Suicide.
6554,5388,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,607,He was always such an unpleasant fellow.
6646,5388,0,12,48,60,1.2,0.052075564392329535,607,This is the proof of our eternal life.
3322,5388,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,607,"He was always so depressing to be around, I think this is a blessing."
6478,5388,5,2,53,60,1.2,0.07440916048338272,607,He always was an open casket kind of guy...
3232,5388,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,607,I thought death was on a holiday.
1850,5388,3,6,51,60,1.2,0.06638357975446148,607,"His last words were, ""Who can compete with the NRA?"""

1498,5388,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,607,I guess we're safe now.
1369,5388,1,10,49,60,1.2,0.057243656051933725,607,I thought he seemed confused when he came to the door.
1300,5388,1,10,49,60,1.2,0.057243656051933725,607,He died doing what he loved. Killing himself.
1276,5388,1,10,49,60,1.2,0.057243656051933725,607,Looks like he finally met his match.
1025,5388,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,607,Somehow he looks different.
1004,5388,3,6,51,60,1.2,0.06638357975446148,607,Who says you can't take it with you!
952,5388,1,10,49,60,1.2,0.057243656051933725,607,The mortician did a good job on the embalming. He looks so death-like.
898,5388,1,10,49,60,1.2,0.057243656051933725,607,"Well Marge, looks like we're still stuck paying off our mortgage."
1873,5388,3,6,51,60,1.2,0.06638357975446148,607,Death always comes when you least expect it!
829,5388,1,10,49,60,1.2,0.057243656051933725,607,"Oh well, what goes around comes around."
727,5388,1,10,49,60,1.2,0.057243656051933725,607,Does he always sleep like that?
583,5388,1,10,49,60,1.2,0.057243656051933725,607,Wyd fathead
413,5388,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,607,I guess I will take death lying down
395,5388,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,607,He who lives by the sword perishes by the sword
359,5388,4,4,52,60,1.2,0.07051064751106302,607,All these years and I never even suspected.
305,5388,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,607,This explains the skeletons in his closet.
297,5388,1,10,49,60,1.2,0.057243656051933725,607,He said something about the client experience ... and then hopped in!
259,5388,1,10,49,60,1.2,0.057243656051933725,607,I hear Keith Richards is doing well.
237,5388,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,607,A suit would have been nice.
236,5388,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,607,They say it was fatigue.
176,5388,1,10,49,60,1.2,0.057243656051933725,607,"""I found the scythe but his hourglass ran out on him."
90,5388,1,10,49,60,1.2,0.057243656051933725,607,Sorry Charlie; better you than me.
30,5388,3,6,51,60,1.2,0.06638357975446148,607,Looks like your death wish is on hold.
3310,5388,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,607,Seeing the Reaper in repose added an uplifting feeling to an otherwise solemn occasion.
801,5388,0,12,48,60,1.2,0.052075564392329535,607,"Long story short, that's why he avoided mirrors."
1913,5388,3,5,47,55,1.2,0.0705915362006309,607,they did a marvelous job. He looks almost lifelike...
982,5388,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,607,I guess we really are old
2016,5388,3,6,51,60,1.2,0.06638357975446148,607,Never thought we'd out live him
2731,5388,1,10,49,60,1.2,0.057243656051933725,607,"I hate to say he got what he deserved, but ..."
2774,5388,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,607,Gross--he looks so lifelike.
2782,5388,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,607,So much for the ZPG movement.
2800,5388,3,6,51,60,1.2,0.06638357975446148,607,Oh crap. Does this mean we will live forever?
2802,5388,1,10,49,60,1.2,0.057243656051933725,607,Is it wrong that I’m kind of relieved? Am I a bad person?
2888,5388,3,6,51,60,1.2,0.06638357975446148,607,"He had it coming. And, again...with the black."
2689,5388,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,607,Wow! Father Time decided to go now rather than go through President Trump's term of office.
2959,5388,4,4,52,60,1.2,0.07051064751106302,607,He didn't pay his taxes.
3022,5388,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,607,Well... looks like he messed with the wrong mamajammas.
3080,5388,1,10,49,60,1.2,0.057243656051933725,607,He always said nobody's perfect.
3107,5388,1,10,49,60,1.2,0.057243656051933725,607,He always was a show-off.
1974,5388,4,4,52,60,1.2,0.07051064751106302,607,I THOUGHT he went to Yale.
2594,5388,0,12,48,60,1.2,0.052075564392329535,607,Ha! I told him I would outlive him.
3219,5388,0,12,48,60,1.2,0.052075564392329535,607,I told him that the General Tsao's chicken was extra spicy...

2515,5388,0,12,48,60,1.2,0.052075564392329535,607,Get those tickets to the Bahamas!
3181,5388,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,607,I always thought he was too mean to die.
2480,5388,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,607,Who knew it had been sick.
2488,5388,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,607,What do you think he meant that he felt redundant ?
2025,5388,4,4,52,60,1.2,0.07051064751106302,607,So this is what death warmed over looks like.
2122,5388,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,607,If he had only had a gun...
2156,5388,0,12,48,60,1.2,0.052075564392329535,607,It's like a New Yorker cartoon come to life…I mean death.

2091,5388,1,10,49,60,1.2,0.057243656051933725,607,I guess death really does come to us all.
2334,5388,1,10,49,60,1.2,0.057243656051933725,607,Yes...he always seemed a bit artificial to me too.
2356,5388,3,6,51,60,1.2,0.06638357975446148,607,"All those years, did he ever bother to visit? Not even a phone call."
2402,5388,3,6,51,60,1.2,0.06638357975446148,607,Suicide is painless
2460,5388,2,8,50,60,1.2,0.061982319330632654,607,That's our scythe.

6076,6281,2,5,49,56,1.1607142857142858,0.06124671056253539,607,I knew that shouldn’t have armed the first grade teacher.
7494,6281,2,5,49,56,1.1607142857142858,0.06124671056253539,607,"Over before we could say boo, hah. Our “boo” scared him to death."
7301,6290,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,607,I guess his time was finally up.
4560,6290,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,607,"Now, Mrs Jones don’t be alarmed, Some days even the devil sits back and admirers my work."
4589,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,"You put the scythe in please, dear"
4636,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,Go check if this means we can also stop paying our taxes
4690,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,Counterintuitive!
4717,6290,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,607,Is this something to do with that 'reap what you sow' stuff he was always talking about?
4780,6290,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,607,The Grim Reaper's final harvest.
4905,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,"Oy, so now we'll be married forever ??"
4918,6290,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,607,I wonder if he saw it coming.
4921,6290,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,607,He looks like death cooled down
4969,6290,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,607,I'm not sure. Maybe we could call an Uber.
5017,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,How can death die? And who's going to take over the grim reaping?
5051,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,"While he looks so peaceful, we can still cremate."
5170,6290,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,607,For the life of me I do not recognize the deceased
5174,6290,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,607,Satire's funeral.
5208,6290,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,607,Evidently Phil's act didn't fool everyone.
4205,6290,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,607,"I always forget. Is it ' you sow what you reap, or reap what you sow'? I'm confused."
5283,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,Is that a threat?
4154,6290,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,607,I don't think he looks grim.
4021,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,It’s at the request of the family. He’s being buried with his favorite scythe.
3057,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,I guess this really is the end.
3089,6290,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,607,"Henry, it looks like I'm going to have to take matters into my own hands . . ."
3125,6290,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,607,"Does "" 'til death do us part"" still apply?"
3148,6290,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,607,"He should have known better, I told him I would leave after girls night out."
3220,6290,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,607,Kind of like the shoemaker's children.
3268,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,They say he lost his job and then he lost his mind
3394,6290,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,607,All it took was being replaced by a robot.
3444,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,The hardest part of death is learning to live without them.
3581,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,"The Reaper's seemed like a nice family, but I'm not surprised that Grim met an early demise."
3627,6290,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,607,I think this explains why he incessantly played AC/DC's 'Highway to Hell.'
3645,6290,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,607,I guess he's off line.
3721,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,"He looks so natural, doesn't he?"
3767,6290,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,607,I told him he was working himself to death and ought to take a vacation.
3774,6290,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,607,"Well shoot, that only leaves us with taxes, huh?"
3943,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,I do admire Leonard Zelig's integrity.
4103,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,He was so alive before #Me too. 3
3034,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,Is this a gender-neutral funeral?
7807,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,That was definitely one of the more interesting eulogies I've heard.
5502,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,"Seriously Lynn, he doesn't look so good."
7221,6290,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,607,"Grim indeed, now what?"
7233,6290,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,607,Why is he in a coffin? I thought he would burn in hell?
7245,6290,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,607,"I did tell him Bobby not to go dressed like that to the Retirement Home, Ohh, he didn't have a chance."
7802,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,"Now this model is a little more than we talked about, but give it 5 minutes and tell me what you think."
7783,6290,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,607,"OK, the sincerest form of flattery but maybe not the most effective."
7663,6290,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,607,"Say what you will, he tried hard to make up for his day job with all his philanthropic endeavors."
7606,6290,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,607,"Serves you right, smarty pants!"
7581,6290,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,607,I told him to lose the scythe.
7535,6290,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,607,I imagine his untimely death could portend good news—for some couples.
7473,6290,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,607,He was made redundant.
7471,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,They said that he had the time of his death last night
7465,6290,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,607,He never looked nicer.
7442,6290,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,607,"I don't know if his hunger for attention is pathetic or funny, but he sure insists on always being in your face."
7433,6290,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,607,Looks like he reaped himself.
7352,6290,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,607,I always thought I would die before him.
7210,6290,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,607,Did you put the For Sale sign out front yet?
5336,6290,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,607,We're looking at Death's Dior
7057,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,He must not have paid his taxes.
6897,6290,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,607,Damn you Chuck Norris!
5510,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,I would have thought they would be a better sales person!
5545,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,If only he were as sharp as his scythe.
5995,6290,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,607,He was there for me when I went through my divorce.
6087,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,They say he looked in a mirror
6138,6290,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,607,he was always there when it mattered most
6155,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,"He sure liked to sow, then to reap and sow again - such a full life."
6316,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,... And he also killed as a landscaper
6372,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,Well. I told him about that mirror time and time again.
6392,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,"If I told him once, I've said another 100 times, 'No running in the house when you got sharp things in your hands!'"
6408,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,Let's call the accountant and make sure we need to file this year.
6462,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,She killed him with a vacuum cleaner. Apparently the only way to win was Dyson with Death.
6728,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,Good riddance. He always wanted us to keep the “th” silent.
6748,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,Who's going to take care of us now?
6833,6290,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,607,"Actually, I am feeling refreshed"
6858,6290,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,607,"Heaven Control directs us to runway J as in John, Three Sixteen-er."
7035,6290,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,607,I guess the next guy gets a new scythe
3016,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,I was thinking of killing myself. Now what am I going to do?
5314,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,"Gosh, I suppose this means it didn't avoid Taxes, either."
2891,6290,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,607,"Now who do we tell when it's ""our time?"""
1436,6290,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,607,He was depressed because he missed us!
1415,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,Now that’s what I call a meta Morpheus.
1372,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,I think that's what the kids call karma.
1318,6290,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,607,Applications are located to your left

1229,6290,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,607,He said he wasn't going down without a fight.
1134,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,His IRA invested in crypto and next day he fell on his scythe.
1013,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,Too bad I just invested in funeral homes.
1009,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,Serves him right - he got a taste of his own medicine.
955,6290,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,607,"Well, this one will not be coming back."
895,6290,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,607,"did you just hear death say ""til' death dies do we part.""?"
724,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,"I can still hear him saying, 'ABC...Always be closing.'"
698,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,"""You would think he would have wanted to be cremated""."
673,6290,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,607,Huh...apparently the AR-15 worked on him!
618,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,He seemed so alive just last week.
597,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,Serves him right! About time for a little payback.
566,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,Like we told you; you can never go home.
544,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,I hope he left a will. I've heard he did a lot of sowing with all that reaping.
537,6290,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,607,"""My guess is he'll give this one four stars""."
477,6290,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,607,I told him not to mess with Chuck Norris.
470,6290,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,607,Looks warmed over.
447,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,"Well, he was always a little different."
372,6290,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,607,"So I told him, 'I didn't ask for a scythe order of death.' And he collapsed."
296,6290,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,607,He looks so natural.
243,6290,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,607,It was a tragic case of physician heal thyself.
223,6290,3,2,45,50,1.16,0.0720544012166771,607,There goes our social life.
92,6290,2,4,44,50,1.16,0.06614763944451557,607,"...an AR-15, eh?"
58,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,I'll bet that Lake of Fire is a real bitch.
2984,6290,1,6,43,50,1.16,0.05965889433663171,607,It's what he wanted but I'll miss his stories.
1503,6290,3,2,45,50,1.16,0.0720544012166771,607,Does this mean it's the end of all of us - the end of all of us?

6605,6744,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,607,"It was his last wish. He thought he could have one on his brother in law, but then, we’ll never know."
4246,6744,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,607,I wonder if he filed his 1040.
6563,6744,2,3,45,50,1.14,0.06395151224456967,607,Looks like he's grasped his last sythe.
6549,6744,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,607,He does look rather grim.

6054,6744,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,607,A dyed-in-the-wool workaholic. I knew he'd never retire!
5696,6744,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,607,I can't believe how deathlike he looks.
5635,6744,2,3,45,50,1.14,0.06395151224456967,607,"I guess his reign ended with the new electric, driverless models."

6552,6744,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,607,"(voice from above): :This is Jesus. See?? Didn't I tell you I'd conquer death?"""
1579,6744,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,607,I told him that last double Margarita would be the death of him.
6284,6744,2,3,45,50,1.14,0.06395151224456967,607,He's trying to trick us.
1466,6744,2,3,45,50,1.14,0.06395151224456967,607,Are you sure he wanted to be buried in his Seventh Seal costume as it does mean a getting a bigger coffin?
1505,6744,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,607,"Not to speak ill of the dead, but cats got to his pride."

79,6744,2,3,45,50,1.14,0.06395151224456967,607,Just like my randy first husband – we couldn’t get the casket shut without a saw
161,6744,2,3,45,50,1.14,0.06395151224456967,607,He always wanted to know what it would be like to be in one.
585,6744,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,607,Now we can get that condo in Aruba.
4949,6744,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,607,This isn't quite how I remember Dave.
964,6744,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,607,"He worked so hard, and for what?"

1226,6744,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,607,Are we sure he's just not napping?
1265,6744,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,607,"Ha ha, Grim Reaper. You reap what you sow!"
949,6744,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,607,It was heart failure
1350,6744,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,607,"Of course, in life, he looked much more like himself."
