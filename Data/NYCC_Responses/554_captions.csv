You were with Ringling Brothers? I was with Lehman Brothers.
Well, it suits you better than the president costume.
Sure, it's all fun and games. Until one of you gets elected.
Hey, all I know is that they left in a very small car.
Would you like that straight up, on the rocks, or sprayed directly in your face?
Shouldn't you be at your confirmation hearing?
Don't let it get you down. There were only so many cabinet positions he could fill.
Well, whoever they hire to replace you is going to have some big shoes to fill.
It's not that kind of happy hour.
Here for the Inauguration?
OK, I'll serve you, but don't try anything funny.
No ID, no drink. I can't just serve every clown who walks in here.
Cheer up. In four years you can be the world's greatest clown again.
In town for the Inauguration?
Sorry, you're late. The rabbi and priest just left.
"Just Bailey's, no Barnum".
I knew Bozo. And you're no Bozo.
You want that shaken or squirted?
First they fired the elephants, and I said nothing.
No Barnums. Will Baileys do?
Maybe she just didn't take you seriously.
Who dressed you, Kellyanne Conway?
Tough day at the confirmation hearings?
You can't be serious.
Sorry -- none of our hours are happy anymore.
Neat, on the rocks, or squirted in your eye?
Do you want that in a glass or squirted directly in your face?
Must be tough, having your kid run off to join a law firm.
First they came for the elephants...
Your wife called. She wants you to pick up a cream pie on the way home.
One more before your confirmation hearing?
Maybe she met a guy with a bigger car.
Who's the jerk now, Bob?
Buddy, these days we're ALL crying on the inside.
Sounds like you're juggling too much
The ad clearly said "only serious applicants need apply."
You can't be serious.
Will the rest of Congress be joining you today?
That's how it ends, one day they just tell you their is no room in the car.
You want it in a glass or to the face?
This is 6100 Pennsylvania Avenue. I think you're looking for 1600.
… so 25 was one too many for the car?
I'm guessing you're in D.C. for a confirmation hearing.
I agree, he is going to make the rest of you look bad.
Orange mop hair, rainbow tutu, big blue grin? Yeah, she was here.
I'll check the lost & found. Can you describe the shoes?
You want that straight up or in the face?
Maybe they all sense you aren't ready for a serious relationship.
Maybe she didn't take you seriously.
They all got in the car and left.
Need me to call you a tiny car?
Just because you show up doesn't make it happy hour.
You should tell her if you're not ready to get serious.
Sorry, sir. No pants, no service.
It's not just you. He made a clown of all of us.
So how'd your confirmation hearing go?
Of course I have beer, do I look like a bozo? Sorry, that was insensitive.
Yes, we are balloon dog friendly
Your Mom and I begged you to go to a regular college.
Don't lose hope. There's still the Supreme Court vacancy.
He offered you Secretary of what?
Sounds like you've got some big shoes to fill.
Nope. Haven't seen that Bozo in here for years.
Girls say they want a guy who's funny and spontaneous, but they don't really mean it.
No more circus? Next you're gonna tell me Donald Trump is President.
I usually expect a priest and a rabbi this time of day, but you'll do.
They really said there was no room in the car?!
Must be pretty cool seeing one of your own make it to the highest office in the country.
These two lions are eating a clown and one says to the other, "Hey, does this taste funny to you?"
Have you considered joining the media circus?
Okay, one drink. But no funny business.
All right, you can stay. But no funny stuff.
What do you do?
Some bozo was just in here looking for you.
Welcome to D.C., I think you're going to fit in just fine.
I'm assuming you're the designated driver for the fourteen guys in the car outside?
Maybe she's not seeing the real you.
That's right, "Sad Hour" specials for the next four years
Hey, smile, pal, one of your guys just hit it big.
Nobody takes me seriously either.
Nobody takes me seriously either.
If you're looking for him, he just left. Orange hair, red face, and tiny hands.
Honestly? When you pulled up in your car, I expected more of you.
Let me explain "Happy Hour" again.
Being the only performer at the inauguration must be a lot of pressure.
Sorry, we don't serve mimers.
Howdy, there. On the rocks or in the face?
I don't want any funny business in here.
Let me explain "happy hour."
Don't take it personally. I call everyone in here "Bozo".
You're not the only clown with orange hair in this town.
The ad said, "Serious inquiries only."
Lemon wedge or banana peel?
I don't want any funny business.
No, you can't just order a banana peel.
The usual, Senator?
Are they sending in any more?
I'm sorry, we've already elected one.
Come on, everything tastes funny to you.
You can have the .357 Magnum right away, but for the cream pie there's a background check and a 3-day cooling off period.
Good morning, Mr. Secretary.
Look on the bright side: now you have representation in the White House.
You're right: You could be president.
Cheer up, pal. If there's one person who can bring back the circus, it's our new President.
It must be tough. Nobody is laughing since Nov 8.
So, what cabinet post are you in town for?
The cabbie says he can fit 23 of you, tops.
Sorry, it's not funny unless TWO clowns walk into a bar.
Straight up, or in your pants?
You must get this all the time, but you look exactly like the president
I'll need to see a picture ID.
The circus moved to Washington.
In a glass or should I just spray it in your face?
The next Happy Hour? January, 2021.
No room for you in the car?
So when is your confirmation hearing?
I feel for you buddy. He is giving clowns a bad name.
Sorry, you're too late, we just elected one, but if you have a billion dollars you might get a Cabinet position.
You're late-- the priest and the rabbi already left.
i gotta hand it to you Jimmy. You really stuck with it. 7th grade class clown and look at you now.
It's an extra $2 to throw it in your face.
Most of the unemployed clowns I know have moved to Washington.
Well, at least you have your dignity.
Surely you jest.
You should've been here last night. It was a three ring circus.
You're too late. They already sent in the clown.
Do you want the seltzer in a glass or down your pants?
The nearest circus? 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue....
Do you want that pie in your face or to go?
The Rabbi and the Priest called...they're running late.
There was a rabbi and a priest asking for you earlier.
Sorry, we don't serve mimers.
Nice try Bozo, but you blinked first.
Sidecar??
With or without the flower, I think your Tinder date will recognize you.
Listen mac, your not the only one with big shoes to fill.
Ringling Bros. is gone for good. But I hear the White House is hiring.
Do you want that in your face or a glass?
Would you like a drink now, or should we wait for the priest and the rabbi?
Surely you can't be serious
You've been here before - I never forget a face.
Would you like that in a glass or sprayed in your face?
When God closes one circus, He opens another.
Nobody likes the picture on their license. I still need to see your ID.
You'll be okay. When one tent closes, another opens.
The unusual?
Let me guess - you're my elected representative.
Sorry, they just all left in one car.
Oh, I get it - this is where I'm supposed to say 'Why the sad face?', right?
No. You being here does not automatically make it "Happy Hour."
Sorry pal -- we only serve seltzer in a glass.
You just missed the priest and the rabbi.
I didn't go to college for this, either.
Cheer up bub. Those elephants are unemployed now too.
Have you considered politics?
You're not a joke unless you walk into a bar with someone.
Smile buddy, you finally got one of your own in the white house
Look, not every bozo gets a cabinet position.
Congress on recess?
Sorry buddy, you are on the no-pie list.
You sure you can juggle two jobs?
You're unemployed because of elephants?
I guess the Greatest Show on Earth couldn't handle the competition in D.C.
Are you laughing on the inside?
The unusual?
Which Cabinet post are you up for?
So how did the confirmation hearing go?
Next happy hour starts in...one hour and four years.
I’ll be glad to call a cab for you, but you’ll probably have to share it with a dozen others.
He's giving you clowns a bad name.
I'm sorry, we don't have an unhappy hour
You're early. The priest and rabbi called and said they're on their way.
I hope that was a whoopie cushion
Unemployed?
Surely you jest.
Sorry, this is happy hour.
You just missed the priest and the rabbi.
So, you want to talk about the elephant NOT in the room?
This is the beer line. There's no punch line.
What should I say if Melania calls?
Long day Mr. Press secretary?
I have to step away for a moment. Don't try anything funny.
Really? You can't be serious.
So what if the circus closed. You can always be Secretary of Education.
Do you want that pie in a box, or in your face?
Shall I call you a very small car?
Oh, I'm a jerk? Well you're a clown.
Some Bozo was looking for you earlier today.
Cheer up, Chuckles. Orange hair is in.
Clowns are out. Buffoons are in.
Sorry about Ringling Brothers, but I hear there's a new circus opening in Washington.
I'm guessing you want the greatest drink on earth.
The duck and rabbi left you the tab.
She wanted me to tell you she found somebody who takes her seriously.
The clown show moved. Try 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
If you start any trouble, I will go straight for your juggler
The new administration is giving you people a bad name.
Something to turn that frown upside down?
Tough confirmation hearing?
So, how is the transition coming along?
I'm cutting you off Chuckles, you're driving seventeen people home.
Look at the bright side...you've got a great shot at a Cabinet position.
I can't offer you health insurance, but isn't laughter the best medicine?
Evening, Senator!
Shouldn't you be at the inauguration?
Let see if I've got this right - you want the whiskey in a glass and the seltzer down your pants?
The usual, Mankoff?
You could always try politics.
Next time come back with a priest and a rabbi.
Friends don't let friends drink and unicycle.
Why the long shoes?
So how'd your confirmation hearing go?
You have big shoes to fill.
I apologize. I was wrong to use the phrase "you people."
I know a place that’s hiring guys with your qualifications…but you have to appear before a Senate Confirmation Committee.
I'm guessing it wasn't the Greatest Show on Earth?
I'll need to see a photo ID.
When you told me you were coming out I thought you were gay.
One sidecar, coming up!
Why the long shoes?
Funny seeing you here.
Let me guess--something with an umbrella?
I need you to work all your shifts until the full Senate approves your nomination.
Seltzer, no ice, straight to the face?
A quick one before your confirmation hearing?
Are you serious?
Any funny business and you’re out.
The orange hair gave you away...
Congratulations on the cabinet appointment.
That's funny: A priest and a rabbi were just in here looking for you.
Have you thought about politics?
Funny seeing you here.
You should have seen it coming when they got rid of the elephants.
We don't want any funny business here.
It would've been funnier if you walked in with priest and a rabbi.
The rabbi and the priest haven't arrived yet.
Sorry, I'll pour it into a glass and you'll have to throw it in your own face,
Let me guess--you want a Sidecar
All of them piled into a tiny car and sped off while you were in the bathroom. They said you'd get the bill.
You can have a drink, but I don't want any funny business.
You can start tomorrow, but no funny business.
We don't want any funny business here.
Will it be Barnum or Bailey's?
I didn't think that they really would send in the clowns.
So, how was your first day as president?
Barnum and Baileys?
You have some big shoes to fill.
The ad was meant to read "must be able to juggle shifts .... "
Well it certainly sounds like you should have won the caption contest by now
Look on the bright side. You won't feel alone in Washington.
Why are you hiding out here? Aren't you supposed to be making America great again?
Going by the color of your nose, I'd say you've had enough
I think that making clowning great again has already be taken care of.
Looks like you missed happy hour.
How did your Senate confirmation hearing go?
Look, I don't want no funny business.
We're not hiring any clowns right now. Try the White House.
I'd be careful...the new administration is sensitive about people inpersonating the president.
On the rocks, pal, or squirted it in your face when you least expect it?
No, I can't put it down your pants.
You're the only clown left, the others got jobs in Washington.
It's not really "Undercover Boss" if I know it's you, Sam.
Just be out of here before Happy Hour.
Here in Washington for the swearing in ?
Sorry about Ringling Bros. closing. Have you thought about running for Congress?
Look, I don't want no funny business.
This is happy hour; silly hour starts at 5pm.
'A clown walks into a bar?' That's all you've got?
You can have anything you want. Remember, you're the President now.
Sorry to hear about Ringling Bros., have you tried The White House?
Sorry, not hiring. Have you tried the White House?
Sorry we're not hiring. I hear the government has a few openings!
No more Ringling Brothers? Cheer up. I hear there's a big clown show starting in Washington.
Seriously?
Let me stop you right there. I have, in fact, heard this one before.
Did you hear the one where "A pervert, a con-artist, and a Fascist walk into a bar. The bartender says, "What'll you have, Mr. President?""
Sorry, I can't take you seriously.
You just missed them. All twenty of them got in a cab.
Sorry, you just missed happy hour.
What will you have, Congressman?
How about a sidecar?
Dressed for the times, I see.
Cheer up. You're guy won.
On the bright side, you won't have to juggle work and family.
So, it says on your resume you went to Trump University?
Ditched the Secret Service again sir?
OK, I’ll bite. A clown walks into a bar. Then what?
Why so glum? You won!
'You wouldn't be the guy who left a VW parked out back last night with 16 people in it?'
You've got some big shoes to fill.
Don't call me a soda jerk, you clown.
Don't worry, the media circus will still be around
Its not literally a happy hour.
I wasn't laughing with you, I was laughing at you.
What happen?... no room in the car.
Try the White House. It will be the next "greatest show on earth."
Happy Hour just ended.
No, I don't want to see how many Sidecars will fit into a clown.
Where's the priest and the rabbi?
I hear you have big shoes to fill.
Best I can do is pour the seltzer in a glass. What you do with it after that is your business.
I can't serve you anymore but I can call you a very small taxi.
You just missed happy hour.
Of course I take you seriously.
You can have a drink but you better not try anything funny.
Sorry - no pants, no seltzer.
You one of those clowns from Washington?
I know it's tough getting rejected to perform at the Inauguration. But I hear there's going to be an opening for press secretary real soon.
This would be funnier if you walked in with a priest, a rabbi, and a horse.
Mid-laugh crisis?
Play what again?
What do you mean, a "clownsgendered" bathroom?
Sorry, we only serve serious drinkers here!
You won't be the first to go into politics.
That flower makes you look stupid.
Don't bother. They're already here.
Congratulations on your confirmation.
no, we're not hiring. Have you tried the White House?
Here for the Inauguration?
So, what kind of work are you looking for?
Why aren't you at the Inauguration?
10 of your friends just left....in a Volkswagen.
Sorry fella, but you might try the White House. They're still hiring.
Tough break. You leave big shoes to fill.
I always get nervous when one of you guys orders seltzer.
I hear Washington is hiring.
You just missed the Rabbi and the Priest, they left with the punchline.
Expecting any other Cabinet members to join you?
Happy Hour? Now? Try again in 2020.
No, I do not have Clown Royal.
Would you like the seltzer in a glass or sprayed in your face?
Maybe they walked into a different bar.
You should get going, sir--you'll be late for your confirmation hearing.
It's a classic story-- clown meets girl, clown falls for girl, girl gets eaten by a lion.
So what cabinet position did Trump pick you for?
I know. Your life's a joke.
I don't mind the clown costume, but you still need to wear pants.
You think maybe she walked in, saw you, and left?
I hear they're hiring in Washington.
Could you tell me the one where the clown walks out of my bar?
Sad ain't it; the only circus left is in DC.
She just left with some other clown, had a poof of blond hair, bright orange face, tiny hands and a big wad of cash.
I'm sorry, I can't serve you, it's happy hour.
Your usual? You think I remember every customer who comes in here, bud?
Closing time. Want me to call you a comically small taxi?
Congratulations on your confirmation, Mr. Secretary,
Pie, I presume.
Sorry, pal. We serve seltzer in a glass here.
Everything tastes funny to you.
Everyone expects me to make them happy too
Sorry, the Priest and the Rabbi just left.
So, a rough day in your confirmation hearing, eh?
Wrong joint, pal. It's strictly ducks, priests and rabbis here.
The previous bartender? Oh, he was nominated to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
Any funny stuff and you're outta here.
Put your horn on the bar, nice and easy.
It's life's illusions I recall, I really don't know clowns at all.
You want it half full or half empty?
Cheer up. You can always run away and join the cabinet.
I've called you a very small car, sir.
The Rabbi and Priest called to say they couldn't make it.
Do you want that half full or half empty?
Let me guess...Seltzer?
Your usual--seltzer in my face?
Yeah, a priest and a rabbi were in here looking for you.
But, seriously...
Let me guess...the rabbi and the priest are parking the car.
I'm pretty sure I can discriminate against you.
Glass, bottle or straight in the kisser?
I've called you a tiny Uber.
Sorry, happy hour's over.
I take it you're part of the new administration.
What'll it be, Mr. President?
We're closed, Mr. President.
We don't serve clowns. Try Capitol Hill.
Congress is back in session, I see.
Shouldn't you be at the White House?
Don't you have an inauguration to be at?
I don't know. Maybe lose the tie.
Maybe you should try politics.
I can still tell it's you, Mr. Trump.
Sorry about the circus shutting down. But, hey, I hear they're hiring at the White House.
I warned you when they got rid of the elephants.
Sorry, Happy Hour just ended.
I'm sorry, I can't serve you. This is Happy Hour.
Tough break on the circus gig, but I hear the White House is hiring.
You really shouldn't be drinking before your inauguration.
Sorry buddy, the Presidents Day free drink promo requires customers to be dressed up as former presidents not the current one.
Sorry, but not just any clown can get elected President.
Tough about Ringling Brothers; I think they're still hiring at the Cabinet.
Let me guess. You're here for happy hour.
That's what I've been trying to tell you pal, the clown convention has been moved to Washington.
Happy hour doesn't start till 6:00.
You didn't get a call for a Cabinet post? Maybe you're just overqualified.
Wrong bar -- we only serve priests, ministers, and rabbis.
Sorry buddy, the Health Dept. requires us to serve seltzer in a glass.
Well, since Ringling Brothers is shutting down, I'd go with the Cabinet post.
You might like the pale ale on tap. It's got a robust nose, floral notes, and a hint of bitterness.
Really? The Cabinet? Which Department?
Relax -- everything considered, I expect you'll be confirmed with flying colors.
Shouldn't you be at your inauguration?
Don't bother. They're already here.
You're joking.
Don’t you have a cabinet meeting to attend?
Long day at the confirmation hearing?
What are you drinking, Senator?
Sorry sir, your invisible dog has to leave.
I'm surprised you didn't make his cabinet too.
The Priest and the Rabbi just left
I don't think this will work without the Rabbi and the midget.
I used to be a clown. Now I'm a jerk.
Ever consider running for office?
Sorry, I guess "Bailey's on the rocks" does hit a bit close to home.
Shouldn't you be at your inauguration?
Honestly, our happy hour is fine just as it is.
Didn't you see the sign, "Big shoes, ugly shirt, no service"?
I'm sorry, but it's happy hour.
Glad to see you back from recess, congressman.
I'll tell you the same thing I told those other 23 clowns: No, I did not find a tiny set of car keys.
I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted to be the first clown elected president.
So you found work in D.C.?"
Banana daiquiri, extra peel.
Clown Royal on the rocks?
Heck, take the offer. A year or two on this White House communication team would look good on your resume.
I see you scared away the priest and the rabbi.
Do you think you'll be able to juggle 2 jobs?
One circus closes and another opens up
Move along, sad bar's down the street buddy, this is a gay bar.
The others have all gone to Washington.
What part of Happy Hour didn't you understand?
You want the usual soda water in the face?
It's nice to see a new face.
About a dozen of them hung around for a while, then they all left in a tiny car.
Usually, this place is a circus.
Sorry, we stopped doing happy hours last November.
They all just piled into a car and left. I guess they forgot about you.
The last clown that was in here just got elected President.
You can't worry about that bozo she left you for.
Happy Hour doesn't work for everyone.
The circus has closed down. I think it moved to Washington.
Well, I heard the new administration is hiring.
Congratulations on your cabinet appointment.
In town for the Inauguration?
Have you considered running for Congress?
Strictly in your professional opinion, how's the new guy doing?
I think you're putting too much emphasis on the "Anonymous", and too little on the "Alcoholics".
The other twelve guys said you were the designated driver.
Cheer up. We need you now more than ever.
Can I start you off with a drink or would you like to wait for the rest of Congress to arrive?
Ringling on the rocks?
Sorry. Uncle Sam already hired a clown.
Bailys, splash of Barnum?
Sorry, your eighteen friends over there said you were the designated driver.
Sorry, we only sell seltzer by the glass.
All your friends just left in a little red car.
Don't be so down on yourself, the last clown I served here is president now
Don't bother, he's here.
In your face or in a glass, same price.
Drinks are half price for men in uniform.
Sorry, we only serve serious drinkers.
Yes, the picture on the I.D. has to look like you.
Don't worry - he wouldn't deport a fellow clown - undocumented or not.
Looks like you've had the last laugh.
That's Right--the Senate just voted to send them in!
Let me guess, Seltzer down the Pants!
Where were you at happy hour?
It's clowns like you who are ruining my business.
This is Happy Hour. Get happy or get lost.
I'm just surprised you didn't enter here with a priest and a rabbi.
Hey, her loss.
"I'm just waiting for the priest and rabbi".
I heard you lost your job. Cheer up ! There's a new circus in D.C. and they're hiring.
So, where's your Secret Service detail?
It was never really about the elephants.
I like your resume, but we're looking for someone a little more upbeat.
Truth be told, I recognized you right away, Mr. President.
I'm really sorry... I thought you'd get Secretary of Defense.
Welcome to Washington. What's your role in the administration?
Maximum occupancy is 85. Why?
Despite all appearances, you have a serious drinking problem.
I'm really sorry, but the priest, the rabbi, and the minister just left.
I don't think having him in office is going to hurt your profession.
Which cabinet position are you up for?
Nonsense, I bet you're qualified for lots of jobs.
Sorry, we only sell seltzer by the glass.
Don't you usually come in with a rabbi and a priest?
You want it in a mug or should I just squirt it in your face?
Plan A was "Bernie or Bust." Plan B was to run away to the circus. This is Plan C.
The 20 guys down there say you're the designated driver.
How did your Senate confirmation hearing go?
Look, I can still tell it’s you. Either pay your tab or get out.
Sir, I'll have to ask you to remove your hat and nose in here.
I don't want any funny business.
Stephen Sondheim sent me.
This is a joke, right?
Seltzer in the face, coming up.
Are you one of those "Make America Great Again" clowns?
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right.
I've got a funny feeling about you.
I'd love to serve you, but the twenty guys at the end of the bar say you're their designated driver.
Emmett Kelly was a friend of mine...you're no Emmett Kelly!
The rabbi and priest just called and to say they're running late.
Of course we have Happy Hour.
I want no funny business here, understand?
Bozo is it? I'm going to need to see some ID.
Tell me if this tastes funny to you.
No shirt, no shoes, no circus.
Trick cup or regular?
They all just left in a Volkswagen.
Good luck with the new job. You've got big shoes to fill.
Come back during happy hour.
Tough crowd at your confirmation hearing?
Why not run for president?
You know, "happy hour" is just an expression.
Forget about the circus. You have a bright future in politics.
So, tell me what it was like being the only entertainer at the Trump inauguration.
If I send them in will you play it again?
So, you think you can juggle two jobs?
I don't care how tiny your car is. You're not good to drive
For people to know how big a clown you are, you have to be on Twitter.
I don't care if there is a clown in The White House. I'm not serving you.
You're close. Go three more blocks, turn left, and the White House will be on your right.
The priest and the Rabbi left about an hour ago.
Actually, he is your president.
Sorry to hear that Ringling Brothers closed. Have you thought about running for Congress?
Don't you usually carpool?
Trump transition team ? Two blocks down
So, I hear you were the headliner at the inaugural ball.
How was the first cabinet meeting, Mr. Secretary?
Cheer up! I hear they are hiring in Washington these days.
One door closes, another opens: Circus is shutting down but Trump is hiring.
I agree. With one of your own leading the country, you should get more respect.
Seltzer?
Wow, Mr. President, I've never seen you without makeup.
I have a funny feeling about you.
You show up here with a nose that red and think I'm gonna serve you?
I completely understand...you should see the clowns I have to work with!
And now you can run away and join the new Administration.
Senator, maybe I should call you a cab.
The priest and rabbi left. They said you're paying the tab.
Sorry, pal. Happy hour's over.
You shoulda been here Saturday night, it was a real circus.
So, if your ringmaster calls, you're not here?
Sorry, but we hire jerks, not clowns.
Did Sondheim send you in ?
Sorry--happy hour just means cheaper drinks.
Big shoes, no service.
Greatest show on Earth, huh? So why'd it close?
And I don't want any funny business.
I hear the White House is hiring.
No, no. This is 1700 Pennsylvania Avenue.
Tough confirmation hearing?
I hear the White House is hiring.
The inauguration? That's next door.
I know the big top is closing but I hear they are hiring at the White House.
Cheer up. The circus may be closing, but the Administration is looking for people like you.
Glass, bottle or silly straw?
Sorry, this bar is for serious drinking only.
I'm gonna need a picture ID.
Cabinet nominees report next door.
Fancy a drink, Mr. President?
Cheer up! Not many can say they were a finalist for a Cabinet position.
The fake hair...orange skin...kind of makes all of you look bad.
Sure, go ahead, send in the clowns.
Do you want that seltzer in a glass?
Don't be silly.
How'd the Cabinet interview go?
Well, we have a merlot that tastes a little funny.
Sir, this is not that kind of happy hour.
It's on the house, Mr. President.
No funny business, okay?
Barnum & Bailey's gone, but I hear a bunch of clowns are being hired at the White House.
No clown shoes, no service.
Happy Hour hasn't started.
You look like you could use a bottle of seltzer.
I think you're looking for Sam's bar mitzvah
If that flower squirts, you're out of here.
So you're in town for a Cabinet post?
Shouldn't you be at the inauguration?
You should have come out last night. It's usually a circus in here.
"As you can see in the picture, several hundred people are having a drink at a bar after attending Trump's inauguration speech." said White House Press Secretary Spicer
Wrong address. You want 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.
I'm sorry about Ringling Brothers, but, hey, there are some great new openings in Washington.
Senate confirmation hearing didn't go too well for you today?
Much better. The smile was definitely scarier.
Now, now buddy...you shouldn't take it personal when they call the new President a clown.
Looking Presidential gets you no special treatment here Buddy.
Sorry, we only serve priests and rabbis.
Sure, the circus may be gone, but at least you can still scare the crap out of small children
Why so serious?
I just heard. Have you thought about going into politics?
The unusual, sir?
I'll give you one more, but I don't want any funny stuff.
Ringling Brothers may be shutting down, but the Trump cabinet is hiring clowns.
Just finished your confirmation hearing?
Cheer up. The circus may be gone, but the Greatest Show on Earth has just opened for a four-year run in Washington, D.C. and it's gonna be Yuge.
Yeah, when he won I knew it was pretty much over for you guys.
Why the drawn face?
I can call you a cab. But you'll have to share it with 25 other clowns.
The elephants were already here – watch your step.
The unusual, sir?
Why do I get the feeling you're setting me up for a joke?
No, I don't think bartending is a dead end job, and I know it's you mother.
Cheer up, you didn't need to win the popular vote.
Congratulations on your cabinet appointment.
Congrats on being the first in our family to graduate from a college.
I'm going to need the keys to the clown car
Sorry pal, but we don't serve Mimers.
We've been seeing a lot of your crowd recently
Making your entrance again with your usual flair?
Screw Ringling, you're a shoo-in with Trump.
Would you like me to call a tiny cab for you and your budddies?
Sorry pal, but you don't look anything like your photo ID.
Sorry, we're all out of seltzer.
Is this some kind of joke?
So no more Ringling Bros....have you tried the new administration?
Sorry, Bozo--but if I serve you, the next thing you know it's a freakin' circus in here!
Some guys know how to walk into a joke and some don't.
They all ran off in the small car and said you'd pick up the tab.
Okay, I'm sorry. When I called the president a clown, I didn't know you'd take it so personally.
Sorry about the circus closing, but they're hiring clowns in D.C. this month.
I have a hard time believing you're going to drink the seltzer.
Let me guess--you want a Sidecar
As long as you're out by happy hour.
No, but if I see the rabbi, the priest, the Buddhist monk, the duck, the horse, or the nymphomaniac I'll tell them you were here.
Well there's a new circus in DC and it's run by one of your guys.
Our 3 new flavors are Anger, Alienation and Fear. Sorry we have run out of Hope.
I can give you a glass of seltzer but you'll have to put it down your pants yourself.
Well, yes, we're hiring. But serious inquiries only.
Look on the bright side. The circus is gone but now you're the President.
I hear some clowns in D.C. are saying that now they're the greatest show on earth.
So... Which bathroom do you identify with?
Now that Barnum and Bailey closed, why not try politics?
So how'd you ditch the Secret Service detail?
Do you happen to know Kellyanne Conway?
We pour local, organic, small batch, craft, artisan, artesian seltzers.
Tough break. There's not much call for clowns, what with the surplus in D.C.
Do you want the dribble glass again?
Twenty-two of you guys in that car and you couldn't find one designated driver?
What sort of business did you say you were in, again?
Here for Happy Hour?
Shouldn't you be at your inauguration ceremony?
What can I getcha? A little song, a little dance, a little seltzer down your pants?
She told me that she needed someone more serious.
What'll you have while you wait for the priest and the rabbi?
Do you want your pie à la mode or in the face?
Sorry about Ringling Brothers. But I hear they're recruiting in Washington.
Sorry, we're not hiring. Have you tried the White House?
Where is the rabbi and the priest?
Sorry, we don't have "to go" seltzer bottles.
I'd suggest the Trump: it's vodka, orange peel, and then we spray seltzer in your face and yell "Sad!"
That must be tough, you not liking kids and all.
What if I told you we don't have a happy hour...
I'm sorry, Mr. President, we don't serve White Russians here.
Don't worry! There are a lot of openings in Washington right now.
Surely you didn't drive here all by yourself.
Cheer up, they are hiring at the White House.
If you can find 14 friends, I'll call you an Uber.
Sure - we serve buses. Send in the clowns.
I hate to ask you this,but would you leave and walk back in again?I'm working on a joke
I can call one, but I'm not sure all 20 of you will fit in one cab.
You're killing Happy Hour.
"Why do you guys always walk into MY bar?!
You're the headliner at the Inauguration?
It's a seltzer down your pants, right?
I'm sorry, I'll need IDs from the other 21 people in the car, too.
Will you be having the unusual?
Sorry, we don't serve Cabinet Members here.
No, I haven't seen a priest and a rabbi.
I beg your pardon. I shouldn't have made any assumptions about who you voted for.
A little seltzer down your pants?
Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, this clown walks into mine.
Don't bother, they're here.
So, where are the priest and the rabbi?
We have closed for the evening, sir. I don't want any funny business.
Let me guess -- you lost your I.D. when your pants fell down?
I didn't send for you.
I don't want to know why you're crying on the inside.
Will you be speaking at the inauguration?
Just seltzer?
Tough day at the nomination hearing, huh?
"The transition from clown to politician should be seamless.
At least you could be happy for the elephants.
Let me guess--a shot of seltzer?
The Inauguration is down the street.
Alright, but I don't want any funny business
Okay, I'll serve you. But this time no funny business.
Don't you know it's happy hour?
I'm sorry. We're not hiring any Trump Cabinet appointees at the moment.
The usual, seltzer leave the bottle?
Usually the walk-ins are priests, rabbis and horses.
Just so you know, I keep a loaded seltzer bottle behind the bar.
Yeah, sorry. It's a whole different kind of circus now.
You're sure you want to have a drink before your confirmation hearing?
Sorry we don't have any openings here. Try the White House.
Is the pie in your face for here or to go?
Sorry, you're too late. I already voted for the other clown.
Your wife called. I told her you just left with 27 other clowns in a very small car.
Have you ever considered running for office?
Seriously, I'm laughing at you not with you.
Welcome to the District of Columbia. Any relation to the new guy?
Sorry, big shoes, loud shirt - no service.
Silly hour doesn't start until five.
Our happy hour’s really more about cheaper drink prices.
Are you waiting for a Rabbi and a Priest?
So, Ringling Bros. is closing? Well...I hear the White House is hiring.
This is Happy Hour. Sad Hour doesn't start until midnight.
Did Ringling Brothers fire you, or have you just been hired for a Cabinet position?
Sorry, pal. Happy hour's over.
You don't have to go back to the circus, but you can't stay here.
I am going to need some identification before I serve you a whole cream pie
Bubbles always wanted to be a lawyer but could never pass the bar.
A clown walks into a bar; stop me if you've heard this one.
Look, come back with a priest and a rabbi and then we'll see if it's funny.
No contest. ‘The Greatest Show on Earth’ is now at 1700 Pennsylvania Avenue.
Are you one of the clowns in town for the inauguration?
Another rough birthday party?
One more bottle of seltzer, then I'm cutting you off.
Know what, bub? Everyone feels misunderstood.
Please stop crying, I can't take the tears of a clown, when no one's around.
I hear the head clown is hiring on Pennsylvania Avenue.
What, no media circus today?
What can I get you to put a smile on that face?
A rabbi, a priest, and a minister? Just missed them.
Just kidding. We ONLY serve clowns here.
Mr. President, what can I get you?
The priest, the rabbi and the nun left fifteen minutes ago.
This one's on me, Mr. President.
Yeah, they all just piled into a VW bug and left without you.
Well, here we are... great again.
Sorry, I can't serve you. You're acting funny.
Seltzer?
I assume the other 37 are parking the car.
You really need to be at your Senate confirmation hearing.
Didn't fit in the car again? Have a beer on me.
I knew Emmet Kelly and you, sir, are no Emmet Kellt
The rabbi and priest will be here shortly.
Well, I'm a 'listening on the outside, laughing at you on the inside' kind of bartender.
Cheer up. The job market for clowns is wide open right now.
Another long day on the Hill?
And Ringling Brothers also cancelled your tab.
Your ID looks a little funny.
Sure I can call you a ride... for how many?
This is supposed to be happy hour.
Aren't you supposed to be in Washington?
Nothing's funny any more.
We no longer serve lawyers without a picture I.D.
Listen, the Inauguration's over, so go back out there and just be the best President you can be. And tweet me now and then, wouldya?
A white house consultant, you say?
The new administration still has job openings.
Listen Bozo, I'm still gonna need to check your I.D.
You'll find work. It's all a circus now.
Sorry, but Trump had the last laugh.
You can't blame it all on the elephants.
Grad school was a long time ago, Jim.
Your Uber driver just called. He wanted to know if you’re willing to share a ride.
Cheer up, pal. He promised to make clowns great again ,too.
I feel for you, buddy, but the Big Top has folded and moved to the White House.
What can I get you, Mr. President?
Let me guess...you want a squirt of water.
We've had clowns like you in here before.
Seltzer? Really??
Why are you so sad? There's a clown in the White House.
Don't be silly.
Many sad tales at 'Happy Hour', but 'the circus is closing' is a first.
Don't be so glum. Refusing to perform at an inauguration is an honor unto itself.
I called you a clown because you called me a jerk.
I hear they're hiring in Washington.
Sorry. It's happy hour.
Drinks are double during Unhappy Hour.
Listen Bozo, I don't want any funny business here.
Big shoes, bright shirt, no service.
The usual Mr President?
You just missed happy hour.
Sorry, we don't serve just any clown who walks in here.
Nuts?
Yeah, they were all here. So, you just couldn't fit in the car, huh?
Hard day at work, Mr. President?
Tough first day in office, huh?
Don't bother, they're here.
I assume you brought your own seltzer?
You're late. The inauguration was last week.
Sorry about your job loss, but the circus just can't compete with today's politics.
Clown Royal on the rocks?
Long day creeping people out?
Sorry about the circus gig, but they're hiring in Washington, D.C.
You should have been in here earlier, it was a real circus.
When one door closes, another opens. Have you tried Washington DC?
I know it's you, Steve. Just pay your tab.
I can't believe you didn't get the cabinet post.
Why the drawn face?
And which cabinet position have you been nominated for?
Aren't you missing your own Inauguration?
Feeling out of step with society today? Don't give up hope...Bozo himself used to sit on that very stool, and now he's President!
I don't care if you ARE the President.
You're right. You might be President right now if you had only run.
Hey, aren't you supposed to be running our country?
The boss says I have to stop giving you free seltzer water.
I guess you didn't see it coming either.
'Make Ringling Great Again,' huh?
I'm sorry about the circus closing. Have you thought about running for office?
Seltzer's a dime a spritz, five bucks a pantsful.
How'd I know your name was Bozo? I took a guess.
What is it about happy hour you don't get?
A little seltzer in you pants?
I'll serve you seltzer, but this time I'm not leaving the bottle.
No priest, no rabbi, no service.
How have you been settling into the White House?
I don't care how your confirmation hearing is going. No pants, no service.
You here for the Inauguration?
I'm also surprised no one else does unhappy hour.
Yes, Mr. President, right away.
That's not really what happy hour is about
Where's Melania?
The first drink is on me, the second on you.
Let me guess, you just discovered that not quite everyone loves a clown
39 guys, red noses, big shoes? Same little yellow car? Sorry, they just left.
Sorry, I think your 14 friends drove off 15 min. ago in a yellow volkswagen.
Happy Hour's over, no thanks to you.
For which cabinet department are you nominated?
Let me guess...Seltzer?
Must be lonely with your friends back in Congress.
Shouldn't you be getting ready for your inauguration?
What'll it be, the usual seltzer to the face?
Just so you know, we're out of cream pies.
"Isn't what rich?
One white wine spritzer, no ice, no wine, no glass ... got it.
If it's any consolation, I think you would have made a great Secretary of Agriculture.
You don't look anything like your ID.
Too bad about the circus closing. I hear they're hiring in Washington D.C.
The pinot has a well-rounded nose.
What can I get for you, Mr. President?
Clown Royal?
You've had enough, pal. Let me call you a tiny, little Uber.
Are you in town for the inauguration?
How would I know when you've had enough.
Elections have consequences.
A rabbi, a priest and minister just left, you should of been here.
You're not familiar with the part of the joke where the rabbi and the priest stick the clown with the bar tab?
I'm sure you'll make clowning great again.
So what if it closed, you still have your dignity.
"You want me to call you a teeny-tiny Uber?
Moving to Washington?
I'm gonna have to start charging for the seltzer.
The joke might be on me, but the beer's not.
Sorry. ‘Clown walks into a bar' won’t cut it anymore. Try 'clown walks into the White House.’
I thought the car was big enough too.
There’s a corkage fee if you bring your own seltzer.
You're overdressed for Happy Hour.
Medical or recreational?
Big shoes, no service.
You expect me to believe that you have seventeen designated drivers?
May I see proof of your date of mirth?
Tough day at the confirmation hearings?
One circus closes; another opens!
All right you can come in, but no funny business.
It seems like you've been juggling a lot lately.
You might as well come in. No joke ever began: "A clown stood outside a bar."
It may impair your ability to drive a tiny car with ten others inside.
Do you want the pie in your face -- or a la mode?
Listen Harry. I serve beer - not fashion advice.
No, we don't have anything that 'tastes funny'.
Seriously. He was sworn in this past week.
Now that the circus is closed you might consider running for president.
OK look, there are some things you can't tell your bartender.
Sorry, it's much funnier when a rabbi and a priest walk in here.
So a clown walks into a bar... wait, have you heard this one before?
That VW really couldn't hold everyone
Welcome to DC. Are you here for the inauguration or the protest march?
How about a Happy Meal?
Looks like you need a happy hour.
Fine. You can have a drink. But no funny business, understand?
Barnum & Bailey's Irish Cream with a splash of bitters?
I think you're going to like working here. Between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. the place is a circus.
I take you're here for happy hour.
Hey, don't look so glum, the circus is in town for at least four years.
Sorry buddy, Uber has rules about how many they will take in one car.
The Rabbi, Priest and Minister just left.
You're early... During happy hour it's a circus in here.
You'd like a Happy Meal?
Yes, I'm aware I don't look like the picture on my license. Now, please, a beer.
Beat it. The little umbrellas are for paying customers.
Ok, cab's on the way, but he has 11 other pick-ups to make.
Honk once for lager, twice for IPA
No, this is 1598 Pennsylvania Avenue. You need to go two doors down.
You're funny-looking, you can get away with anything, and you don't know a damn thing about national security; I'd say you've got a pretty good shot in 2020!
The others are being sworn in Washington.
I still need ID, it's a clown college town.
Can't serve you, Fred. You're driving the clown car tonight.
I hear the show is moving to D.C.
So that's one cream pie, a bucket of confetti, and a bottle of seltzer?"
We don't serve colored folks.
Don't fret, there must be a cabinet position in the new administration for your talent.
So far, only one other clown that I know will be at the inauguration.
Bar policy: red nose, we cut you off.
Sorry, did you ask for a Clown Royal?
Go home, you're piefaced.
Buddy, if you're looking for a happy meal, you're in the wrong place.
Sam isn't here. He says you scare him.
While Trump can't bring back your job, you have the perfect qualifications to be his advisor.
So all 12 of them are gone--and the VW?
I would have noticed if a priest and a unicorn walked in here.
Don't worry about losing your job. You have big shoes to fill.
No, the confirmation hearings are two blocks south.
I'll give you a shot, but you've got some big shoes to fill.
You were the best entertainer at the Inauguration.
Sorry, but we don't take any funny business here.
I wanted to be Secretary of Education but they said I'm overqualified.
Clown walks into a bar.
Shouldn't you be getting sworn in right now?
Don't make me laugh!
I warned you those senators would be tough at your confirmation hearing.
There’s a corkage fee if you bring your own seltzer bottle.
My confirmation hearing didn't go well.
Six cream pies to go. Anything else?
You drove here by yourself?
Can't you take a joke?
None of our beer tastes funny
I'm glad I'm not in your shoes.
Funny you should stop by.
Incumbent presidents are hard to defeat, but given your qualifications, I say go for it!
Your usual little song, little dance, and a little seltzer down your pants?
I should be able to think of something witty to say by the time the priest and rabbi arrive.
Sure, your confirmation hearings were tough. But hey -- now you're a member of the cabinet.
sorry sir, happy hour is over
Hang in here, Happy Hour begins in 30 minutes.
It's extra if you want that to the face.
Welcome to "the greatest bar on earth".
This is no time for levity.
I had no idea Chief Twitter Strategist required Senate confirmation.
Rough 1st day Mr. President?
You want seltzer on the side or right in the kisser?
You'll need to come back with a rabbi and a priest.
You went to grade school with him and now you are Secretary of the Treasury? Cool.
You want that seltzer water in a glass or sprayed in your face?
Always good to see you, Mr. President.
The rabbi and the mathematician? They're already here. Last table to your left.
Ok, what will it take to put a smile on your face?
That cop outside just ticketed your tricycle.
Where's the priest and rabbi?
Soooo, how's the presidency going?
Stop honking your horn-I will be right with you.
We can make the circus great again.
That's right,$250. Your 15 friends just packed into an impossibly small car and drove off while you were in the bathroom.
I dispense the seltzer. Got that?
Irrational fears hour is from 5 to 7.
I'd suggest Washington D.C., but they're over their quota of clowns right now.
We've had too many complaints. No more cream pies to go for you.
Did that last drink taste funny to you?
So, how'd you hear about our Not Happy Hour?
Who needs a clown when Trump's in the White House.
Have you considered politics?
One circus replaces another. Sad!
1600 Pennsylvania Ave is just up the street. You can't miss it!
I thought you'd be at the inauguration.
Charlie, I don't see why you find it necessary to act out these 'A clown walks into a bar' jokes.
Nice try but it's still not happy hour.
You going to clown around or order a drink?
Will that seltzer be to go or just sprayed in your face?
A job ? Don't make me laugh.
Come back at Happy Hour.
Yes, we have seltzer.
Bailey's I can do, but no more Barnum & Bailey's.
What can I get you, Mr. President?
So, you're happy on the INSIDE?
No jobs here. Try the White House
You're in the wrong joke...it's "two cannibals are eating a clown, one says--this taste funny to you?"
Why not run for president?
Yeah, the Trump administration's poaching hit Ringling Brothers pretty hard.
First, I'll need to see a photo ID.
For eight people in a single car, I would recommend cups, not cones.
We don't serve bozos.
I saw you had a rough confirmation hearing.
What's up? You look like the circus just died.
Don't worry... A brand new one just opened at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.
This is a respectable joint, so don't try anything funny in here!
We don't serve multicolored people.
Sorry sir. No smile, no service.
My wife doesn't understand me either.
I'm sorry, but we don't take funny money.
Cheer up. You may be sad and drunk, but you're still a clown.
Seltzer water it is. Do you want the whole bottle?
Um. Sorry. This picture doesn't look anything like you. Got another form of ID?
How'd your inauguration go?
Sorry, the other 30 guys said you were the DD
If birthday parties don't work out, I heard they're hiring for the Cabinet.
No kidding.
Is it still Happy Hour?
Too bad about the circus, but I hear Trump still has some openings.
Are you here for the inauguration or a Trump appointee?
I hear those confirmation hearings are rough
I think that you have an EXCELLENT chance of winning the election.
I'm sorry-we're out of seltzer.
Sorry. We filled that position in November.
Laid off, eh? Well, you could always run for President.
Not everyone could get a cabinet post.
You could always try for a Cabinet position
One UNHAPPY MEAL coming up!
You're not the only clown to come in here thinking you can drown your sorrows.
I think you're looking for the White House next door.
Usual, Joe, with a bucket of confetti water on the side?
No funny business here, Buddy!
I can't serve you unless you have eleven designated drivers.
We only sell pie by the slice.
Sorry. You can't drink and drive 32 people in one car.
I told you Bill, if you get clown-faced in my bar I gotta shut you off.
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm a crying on the inside bartender. What'll you have?
What makes you think you're qualified to run for office?
I suspect you won't appreciate the irony but "happy hour" is over.
That was the Inauguration team. They want to send you in.
Sorry, no seltzer.
If you can't find a way to juggle a career and family, what hope is there for the rest of us?
I have no son.
Hello, Mr. President!
Ever consider running for office?
The usual Mr President?
I know you're the only one performing but the inauguration is still a pretty big deal.
We don't serve clowns here ... we just elect them to the highest office in the land.
Now before you start, I don't want any funny business
I suppose you're looking for a punchline.
Squirt me with that flower again and Sam is going to kick your ass!
No funny business
Clown shirt, clown shoes, no service.
No Shtick, no service.
All our seltzer bottles have gone missing. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
Sam suddenly realizes the country is being run by clowns.
Better give me your order fast. A little car just pulled up outside.
Cheer up buddy,he won't buy up all the orange wigs.
We want to keep Portland weird, not creepy.
I hear the new administration is looking for help.
Sorry, the juggler had better bartending skills, and the fire eater got the job on the grill.
Want your eggs funny side up?
I'm not letting you drive, no matter how small that car is.
Sure you can get elected, it's been done before ..
Sorry. It's happy hour.
Sorry, but some bozo just ran off with our last bottle of seltzer.
You look like you could use something serious.
What'll it be, Mr. Secretary?
Sorry, we're all out of the rubber chicken
Nice try, Senator, but I think you've had enough.
Don't care if you're a 'happy' drunk. You've had enough.
I hear you're the main act at Trump's inauguration.
No more seltzer, pal. I am cutting you off.
Why the clown face, Mac?
Happy Hour is just a euphemism.
I see one of your associates made to the White House.
I'll validate if the rest of them get out of the car.
Hey pal, why don't you just go home and take the Greatest Shower on Earth.
We don't do Happy Hour.
Well, you got my vote.
I thought that happy hour would draw a different type of crowd.
Don't worry, Mr. Weiner. I won't blow your cover.
Just consider the breakup with the bearded lady a blessing in disguise.
Didn't I see you at the Inauguration?
I'm sorry, with a splash of seltzer where?
You from Ringling Bros.? This one's on me.
What'll it be, Mr. President?
Sam I am
Yeah, I miss the elephants too. What can I get you?
Tough day working in the new Trump cabinet?
"Who sent you in?
You the designated driver? Two dozen guys looking for you back there.
We've served so many clowns, it's not even funny.
It must be an oversight; other than not being a billionaire, you were perfectly qualified to get a spot in the new Cabinet.
You say Trump stole your act?
You just missed our happy hour.
This one's on me. I know those Senate confirmation hearings can be rough.
Seltzer I assume?
She said that I'm no fun anymore.
This better be a good one.
Mr. President.
New job at the White House got you down?
One minute I'm in the 'Greatest Show on Earth,' and the next, I'm in the Cabinet 'Making America Great Again.'
Sorry, all the other clowns left for Washington.
Your senate confirmation hearing has be rescheduled for Tuesday.
How now frown clown?
We're out of Clown Royal.
Actually, I have heard that one before.
The clown convention moved to Washington, D.C. this year.
It sounds like you've been juggling too much for too long.
You could always get a job with Cirque Du Trump.
So your boss gets inaugurated, and whammo, you're out of your tweeting job.
I guess we're both therapists in our own way.
Let me guess - the wife caught you foolin' around again?
C'mon cheer up, 146 years was a great run.
So this is what Trump meant when he said he was bringing jobs back.
Have you considered running for President.
This is the wrong address. Your interview is at the circus in the Tower a few blocks up.
Sorry, we don't have unhappy hour here.
Don't expect sympathy from me. I got two rescue elephants at home.
Say, weren't you in here yesterday with the Rabbi and the Priest.
Tough luck, but I guess why go to the circus when you can watch CNN.
I'm funny how?
No, it's not automatically happy hour when you come in.
Stop me if you've heard this one.
You think all your friends will fit in one cab?
I take it that you're not looking for a serious position.
Sorry, no funny business allowed.
Eighteen beers...my buddies are parking the car.
I see you are here for happy hour.
So what you've been laid off, have you given any thought to Politics?
Hey, why the drawn face?
How about a Barnum and Baileys Irish Cream?
Sorry pal, I don't talk politics, religion, or the circus
Sorry, no happy meals here. Try down the block.
Sorry buddy, we only serve serious drinkers here.
Well, you're probably right Sam, Ringling can't complete with the big clown in the White House.
You're ruining happy hour.
Maybe the car just wasn't big enough for one more......
I used to think life was a circus too
Wait, let me guess! A little seltzer down your pants?
I thought you were on the wagon.
...Make it double. Today has been a circus!
Just come back from the inauguration?
The White House is next door.
Sorry, we've already sent in a clown.
So you've got thirteen designated drivers, huh?
Sorry, Bub. Happy Hour just ended. It's Schadenfreude Time.
No oversized shoes, no rainbow hair, no service.
What are you clowns drinking these days?
Welcome to Sam's. Where childhood dreams come to die.
Don't cry--I think a few Cabinet spots are still available.
Sorry, we have to let you go. Customers complained that everything you served tasted funny.
Would you like me to call a clown car?
You want it in a squirting flower?
We're all out of seltzer water.
Sorry, we only serve mimes.
Yes, I do get a lot of clowns in here.
Hey, Donald.
I used to be a clown, now I just do standup.
So, which country are you President of?
A little seltzer down your pants?
Sorry, no ID, no drink - but I'd be happy to shoot some seltzer water in your face.
Sorry, we're outta seltzer
Happy Hour starts in ten minutes. We don't have a Funny Hour.
I know it's not as funny, but tonic water's all we got.
Your odds are pretty good for 2020 if 2016 proved anything.
You walked into a bar, I get it but you still need the punch line.
Sorry, no happy meals here.
ID?
I hope you're a better tipper than the clown who came in yesterday.
They already have one in the White House !
Cabinet huh?, well as one door closes another open I guess...
Would you like the seltzer water in a glass or sprayed directly in your face?
No, I'm dead serious: We're out of seltzer.
Sometimes the show must not go on
You drove alone?
Today's your lucky day. We actually DO serve clowns like you in here.
Paris. Go to Paris. They love clowns, they love the circus and they don't give a damn about the elephants.
Pretty sure I've heard this one before, but OK, go ahead
Rough kids' party?
I didn't know you could break your funny bone.
Yuengling or Ringling?
What are you, some kind of clown?
I'm just saying... not sure Blotto is the best name for a clown.
What are you running for?
Where do you want the seltzer?
So, Bozo, what's this I hear about you getting a place in Trump's cabinet?
Sorry, I've discontinued happy hour.
I'm sorry; we only serve clowns that make laughter great again.
Stay creepy, my friend.
Sorry, we don't serve sad clowns during happy hour.
Sorry, I promised my boss no funny business.
You looking for the White House?
Do you want that seltzer water shot in your face or do you want to drink it here?
I thought you'd be at the senate confirmation hearings being grilled with the other clowns.
"Who sent you in?
Happy Hour just ended.
He just put you all out of work, right ?
No, I don't want a little song, a little dance, or a little seltzer in my pants.
35 years with Ringling Brothers, and all you got was a whoopee cushion, a rubber chicken, and a gold watch that squirts water?
Gallon of seltzer water it is.
Lemme guess. Another seltzer?
Beer yes. Cream pie no.
I'm assuming you don't mind that it tastes a little funny.
Are you the clown who was in here last week?
I heard about the elephants but you too?
You're not alone.
The Inauguration was last week.
I'm guessing this is your first "Happy Hour"
I juggle three jobs.
Sorry, we're all out of seltzer.
Your usual seltzer?
Unhappy hour doesn't start till midnight.
Won't this make you late for your inauguration?
Sorry, pal – I gotta cut off anyone with a red nose.
So I get it...he stole your act.
Hey, man, you look like you just lost your best elephant.
I'm sorry Barnum and Bailey closed. On the positive side, I hear there are job openings in Washington DC.
Sorry, we don't entertain clowns here. You are looking for Uncle Sam's.
Sorry, we're out of pie.
Great disguise, Gov. Christie.
'Sam, I know it's you and your wife still says to call her immediately.'
Actually, we don't have a 'happy hour'.
I know how you feel. I used to work for Blockbuster.
Sorry, Supreme Court justice candidates actually have to pass a different bar exam
You must be a member of the incoming administration.
Hold the seltzer?
They all left in a sidecar
If we start serving pie, I've got your resume on file.
Would a Baileys be too soon?
It's our 'Unhappy Hour' - zero drinks for the price of one.
Sorry, we're out of creme pies.
More seltzer?
Don't worry, the whole country's a circus.
The priest and the rabbi will be right in--they're looking for a parking space
I'm cutting you off. No more seltzer.
Yes, I 'm sad, tomorrow I'm having a clownoscopy.
Just liberal press bias. You'll do fine at your confirmation hearing.
I'm sorry, we're all out of Clown Royal.
No, no, no. I told my wife I deserved a "CROWN" for putting up with her...
Designated driver or not, you’re too late. They all left in a tiny little car a while ago.
Soda fountain in the face as usual?
Want your seltzer water in a glass, or should I just squirt you down today?
If they'd called themselves the Ringling Sisters this never would have happened.
Why so serious?
I'm out of seltzer too.
I know, I know... Everybody hates you. What are you drinking?
Inauguration jitters?
What can I get for you, Mr. President?
How was the inauguration?
Mr. President.
How was the inauguration?
Good evening, Mr. President. What would you like to drink?
Your inauguration is down at the Capitol, Sir
I'll get your seltzer, but no funny business.
How about a White House cabinet job?
So, you're with the Inauguration?"
What'll it be bozo?
OK, one draft. But no funny stuff.
Why the sad face paint?
I'm sorry, sir. All orders for over a hundred custard pies must be placed three days in advance.
You're scarier sober.
A door closes, a door opens. Try running for President.
We're all out of mirth. How about some cheerful dread?
I don't want no funny business here.
Well I can see you don't enjoy doing the job as much as you liked campaigning for it.
Sorry about your confirmation hearing.
Hey, why the wide face?
Yes, we have whipped cream. Why do you ask?
So they inaugurated you, and you're still not happy?
The usual? Seltzer with a shot in the eye, right?
I understand that the circus is gone. We get our laughs from politics.
No carpool today?
So, where are the rabbi and the priest?
Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, you walk into mine.
I'm sorry, sir. It's not that kind of bar anymore.
You want that beer served in a dribble glass or straight from the flower on my lapel
Sorry to hear about your gig at Ringling Bros., but I hear Trump still has some cabinet openings.
I don't know how to make a 'Banana-Peel Daiquiri'
I'm looking for somebody who can tell me whether or not something tastes funny.
We are not hiring but I heard Trump still had some cabinet positions to fill.
So, just a seltzer, then?
How about something to turn that frown upside-down?
In all the gin joints in all the towns in the world he walks into mine.
Just the usual: vodka with a twist of balloon?
I will order in a minute. Just waiting on the priest and the rabbi.
I don’t want no funny business in my place.
Forget the circus -- I hear the White House needs a court jester.
Have you considered running for office?
What kind of clown comes to a bar and asks for ice on the rocks.
Sorry - we stopped giving clown discounts when Trump was elected.
Happy Hour starts when you leave.
They're hiring at the White House.
This job is not your calling. I suggest you run for political office.
How was the inaugural parade?
Could be Sad Clown Disease.
Have you considered taking your act to Twitter?
You should have run. You'd do a better job than that other clown.
You'll have to leave your balloon animal outside.
I would be happy to support your presidential campaign in 2020. There's no way you could lose.
Something to make you feel sadder?
I think it's a little early to campaign for 2020.
Sorry to hear the Greatest Show on Earth is shutting down, might check out the circus in Washington
cheer up Bozo...there are still a few cabinet positions available.
Nice try, Tommy, but you are still 17.
Don't worry, I know they are big shoes to fill but you will do fine.
Sorry, we don't have a Happy Hour.
Nice try, but Happy Hour is over.
Sorry, but we don't really need a bar clown. Try D.C.
You want anything with the seltzer?
I assume you brought your own seltzer?
Sorry Chuckles, but we're fresh out of Clown Royal.
Just some seltzer?
What'll you have, Mr. President?
It's not happy hour.
Since the election, we've decided we don't have to serve your kind here.
We don't have a happy hour.
sorry but this is happy hour
Don't tell me...seltzer and pie, right?
Something to wash down the tears?
One giant spray bottle of seltzer, coming up.
Don't worry, Bozo, I'm sure another cabinet post will open up soon.
You'll land on your feet Chuckles, there are plenty of opportunities to frighten children. Have you considered dental school?
So, anyone ever mistake you for the president?
Just the unusual today, Sam.
This is Sam's Pub. You're looking for Sam's birthday party.
Oh it's happy hour. Just not for you.
You just missed our happy hour.
I guess you're here for happy hour.
Yeah, so how do you think the elephants are feelin' right now?
You've had enough Bud - I'll call you a clown car
Anybody ever told you that you look like a clown?
I hear there are openings down at the Congress.
I can see by your nose you've had enough.
Are you here for happy hour?
Clown walks into a bar. Now that's funny.
Are you with the circus, rodeo, or SCOTUS nominees?
You missed Happy Hour
Sorry, we're out of seltzer water.
Where's the duck and the priest?
I'm out of seltzer.
Sorry, this is 1601 Pennsylvania Ave.
I'm sorry. We're fresh out of cream pies.
Health Department won't allow a little song, a little dance, a little seltzer down your pants.
I'll call you an Uber that seats 35.
Sorry, we don't have a Happy Hour.
You just missed a traveling salesman, a horse and a rabbi.
We need to re-think Happy Hour.
Sorry, I just hired the bearded lady.
Let me guess another club soda?
You're here to raise our spirits?
Yeah, your friends just left. The Uber guy said he could only take fifteen in the Prius.
Now, there's no sense in being depressed about it. Just accept the fact that your job is to terrify small children.
I'm sorry, but we don't have a Happy Hour.
Another cream pie?
Your wife called, she needs her hat back.
Sorry, you just missed happy hour.
What'll you have Governor Christie?
I get it. A clown walks into a bar. Now what's the rest of the joke?
Sorry, no big floppy shoes, no service.
Sorry--we're all out of pie.
...well it's mostly gin, creme de mint a little song, a little dance ,a little seltzer down your pants.
alright, but no funny business!
Yeah, I'll miss the elephants too.
Why the long face? No more room left in the Trump cabinet?
Well, have you considered working in politics?
You look like you could use a drink.
Sure you are...so where's your Secret Service detail?
Have you considered maybe running for office?
We've got nothing, but I hear they're hiring at Goldman Sachs.
I don't know who jacked your orange wig. You need a better description than 'chubby guy, tiny hands.'
Is this a joke?
Have you thought about going into politics?
Hey! Shouldn't you be in the Oval Office?
Too bad about Ringling Brothers. Maybe you can catch on with the new administration.
I tried to get into the inauguration ceremony, but they told me they already had a clown.
Come on in. Everyone in here already has a big red nose.
No kidding.
Sorry pal we don't have happy hour .
No contest. ‘The Greatest Show on Earth’ is at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
Congratulations on your selection as the new POTUS emoji.
Nope..this is S'MAS...SAM'S is down the street
They moved the clown party to the White House.
You'll be fine. We've elected clowns president before.
Circus ran away on you?
Don't feel so bad. You're not the only Cabinet nominee not to be confirmed.
You heard me. No. More. Seltzer.
You say it all started to unravel when they got rid of the elephants.
I don't think there are any cabinet positions still available.
You'll have to come back after Happy Hour.
We're all out of spritzer.
First shake is on us, Mr. President
A little song, a little dance, a little seltzer down your pants?
Well, you can always run for president.
Usually the Washington elite drink at Joe's.
When is this fucking acid going to wear off?
I hear ya, the confirmation process is a nightmare.
It's ironic. With one of your colleagues now in the White House, I guess the Greatest Show actually will live on.
Circus experience should get you elected to Congress.
You have some nerve showing your face around here.
I thought I heard congress was back in town.
I once killed a clown, just to watch him die.
Sorry, I'm still going to need to see a photo ID....
Aren't you late for the inauguration?
Yeah, Cirque du Soleil's killing us all.
Sorry, bud, happy hour just ended.
Yeah sure, you're the first clown who ever said, play it again, Sam.
Cup of water or cup of shredded paper?
I'm not hiring, but Trump Tower is just down the street.
Who would have guessed the President would take your job?
I'd like you to leave. It's time for happy hour.
We really miss the elephants too.
There's always one clown sitting around waiting for Happy Hour to start.
Can I see your id?
I wasn't laughing at you, I was laughing with you.
So your agent booked you for the inauguration?
Sorry, it's not that kind of happy hour.
Cheer up, it will be over in 4 years
No I don't want to buy a circus.
Happy hours not till 5:00 o'clock.
I'm going to need some sort of ID.
I'm sure you'll land back on your big red feet.
Well, I heard Donald Trump is hiring
This isn't a good humor bar.
Everybody loves a clown. Every clown loves a double bourbon and soda.
Don't take it from me, but I heard there is still an opening at State.
Why would I know your name? You're just some Bozo.
You'd better be a clown. We don't serve mimes.
I know you're the president, but we don't serve clowns.
Sorry, but my religious beliefs prohibit me from serving anyone who makes animals out of balloons.
Listen pal, for the last time I ain't servin' you beer in a dribble glass.
You actually lost by 3 million votes.
You have to pay your seltzer tab, Harry.
The elephants. I heard.
Well,Your Honor, if it was me, I wouldn't wear it for the swearing in ceremony, but I might wear it to the parties.
Sir, we have a dress code. Are you wearing shoes?
Day after day, you come in here just to laugh in your beer.
So, you wanted to be a real estate developer but turned out to be a clown....interesting.
Me, scary? Check out the White House clown.
Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, you had to walk into mine.
Your wife left you? That's rough. At least you have your job at Ringling Bros. Circus.
You want to see a real circus, stick around for happy hour.
I haven't seen that bozo in weeks
Did you want that seltzer with a lime or squirted in your face?
The end of humor must be rough. But have you considered a career in politics?
What? Not all the clowns can be president.
Sorry, pal, you look nothing like your ID.
You guys should consider a few more designated drivers rather than all piling into one vehicle.
No, there are no free drinks for new cabinet members.
Three bottles of seltzer is the limit.
You’re too late for happy hour.”
We don't serve gin and comic here.
You're just in time for Unhappy Hour.
On the plus side, after May you can become an advisor to the President.
Don't look so sad...One of you is our new leader.
That's not what we mean by "Happy Hour."
I'm sorry, but I need to see ID ...whether your wallet fits in your car or not.
I thought you were all sent to the inauguration.
I will serve you a tonic water, but if I see anything coming out of that flower...
He's just lonely because there was no room for him in the Volkswagon.
I suppose you want to talk about the elephant in the room!
We got happy, sad or psycho.
No stilts, no service.
We don't serve bozos.
Well Sir, Hoover liked dressing in women's clothing.
Squirting seltzer down your pants is a buck extra.
We get a lot of clowns in here.
Sorry, we don't serve minorities.
It's your party, you can cry if you want to.
No, you are not the first clown to say "Play it again."
I just don't see you as a bouncer, but thanks for your interest.
Cheer up Bozo. I hear Mr. Trump is still looking for people to join his circus.
Come back after 5, it's a 3-ring circus
.UOY ta 'nikool s'ereH
So you're the inauguration entertainment?
So, that was one whipped cream pie and a coffee, black?
Your twenty-seven designated drivers are waiting for you.
Business is bad enough without clowns like you hanging around.
I was never sent in either. Look at me now.
God, another Trump voter?
Don't look so glum. There's a new circus starting down in DC. You could be Secretary of State!
No, Man. I feel compassion. You did everything in your power to not get elected.
Let me guess, you brought your own seltzer.
Did you say " hit me " ?
No, we don't need a political consultant.
What can I get you? You seem down at the mouth.
'Ringling brothers closed and I didn't get a cabinet appointment."
I can imagine it sucks being the 11th one in a 10 person VW.
I'm sure it has been a rough first week. What'll you have, Mr. President?
Don't just sit there, make me laugh.
How long have you been in politics?
Yuengling or Ringling?
I couldn't pass the bar...
So are you a real clown or just a guy in a clown outfit?
Laid off? At least they gave the elephants notice.
Will it be the usual, Donald?
Let me get this straight...you returned from the bathroom only find that your 19 friends already left in their car and stuck you with the bill. Looks like the jokes on you.
Nothing sadder than the beers of a clown...and there's no one around.
Did your inauguration act go well?
? k n i r D
If they let you keep your little car, I hear Uber's hiring.
Yes, I do believe you are a banker but balloon payments are not accepted here.
One "Barnum & Bailey" on the rocks, comin up.
Remember my sixth birthday party? The balloon dog you made me died the next day.
Sorry, ten little umbrellas is the limit
Don't bother, he's here.
First Happy Hour?
Haven't you heard? Happy hour's been repealed.
She said thanks, but she's looking for more than a few laughs.
.srekoj evres t'nod eW
Rough day at the big top?
Can I see some ID.
What makes you think you'd be a good soda jerk?
What'd mean Trump wouldn't hire ya? Your perfect!
Sorry, but we do not serve the current White House incumbent or anyone who looks like him!
Whiskey Sour, hold the whiskey?
Yes, I am Sam but I don't serve green eggs and ham.
Nope, I can't play it again.
Sorry, no funny business.
Having the unusual?
No priest, no rabbi, no service.
I hate ta ask ya this, but can ya show me yer hands?
I hear ya buddy...I used to be a mime.
Then you should wear a disguise, Mr. Trump.
I'm not sure that counts as "profiling."
No, I don't think it tastes funny.
Sorry...but they are taking applications up at The Tower!"
Apropos disguise Mr. President.
They're saying the circus elephants have moved into the West Wing.
They still recognize you, Norm.
Oh I'm sorry, I thought they were only retiring the animals.
We have a strict policy against serving Bozos.
So, only one of you in that Uber ?
Huh. This place is usually packed after your car pulls up.
Boston Cream.... sure. Would you like that in your face?
Ever consider working in the White House?
Seltzer water? Why do you ask?
No, I'm not surprised. The last clown I had in here was up for a cabinet position as well.
#Sad!
You just missed him. He's in Washington, D.C. now.
No funny business please
Seriously..... I thought you were a shoo-in for the cabinet job!
It took toll on all of us, I had a mullet before the election.
We don't serve your type. Try the White House.
The Donald Trump rally is 6 blocks South of here.
What'll you have, Mr. Trump?
Sorry, it's only a circus in here on weekends.
The hard part about being a bartender is figuring out who is drunk and who is just stupid
You're outta luck buddy. We don't do pro Bozo work here.
For just once, could you put on a happy face?
Look, I've told you a hundred times! We don't serve clowns like you!
Happy hour doesn't start until 4 PM.
Funny you should say that.
I'll get an Uber for you and 20 of your friends.
No need to show ID, Mr. Trump.
Let me guess.....Nobody Laughed?
Now that the circus has moved to DC, which cabinet post are you up for?
Are you one of the Deplorables?
It's not funny any more.
What's your pleasure, Mr. President?
Hey Buddy, why the wide face?
Sure, a guy can drink a cosmopolitan without looking silly.
Sorry, no discounts for Trump's staff.
The White House is two blocks down. What position did you say he appointed you too?
Another seltzer?
Give me your keys, and the keys of the other ten guys in your car.
Sorry, I'm all out of laughs.
Straight, on the rocks, or to the face from a bucket that may or may not contain confetti?
Got a photo ID?
My boss says I can't serve anyone with a red nose.
I am more sorry than you could possibly know about Ringling Brothers, but the beer is still $3!
If it starts with a Rabbi, a Priest, or a Lawyer then I've already heard it.
Hey Bud! Why look so glum? I bet you have a great future with the new administration!!!
You've had enough; you're starting to look a little goofy.
Usually, it's a three ring circus in here.
Oh, don't worry, Mr. President. Your secret's safe with me.
What do you want with that banana peel?
I'll get you the drink, but I'm going to have to hold the seltzer.
The alternative fact is that the circus has still closed.
How about a stiff one? Your job just got a lot harder.
You just missed your friends. They all jumped into a Mini Cooper and left not ten minutes ago.
Seltzer refills? I'm not falling for that one again.
I'll need to see some proof of age.
That shirt, those shoes -- no service.
Oh, sorry sir, I don't know what made me think you were a clown.
Aw, whatsa matter, your guy hasn't made America great yet?
Some clown painted my name backwards.
Sorry, we're all out of dignity.
Yeah, I'm a jerk, you're a clown--yadda, yadda....
Sorry, Happy Hour ended at 6:00.
Once Barnum and Bailey's closes, you can cash on your degree from Trump University.
She just left. She said the guy she was dating was a real clown and she couldn't take it anymore.
Of all the gin joints and all the clowns in all the world, he walks into mine.
Your drinking buddies are all cabinet members now
I guess you didn't see the sign that says: HAPPY HOUR?
Silly shirt, giant shoes, no service.
Sorry, super-happy hour is over.
First they got rid of the elephants, now the clowns.
Reality is the new funny.
A philosophy major? Sure, I have an opening for you.
I'm all out of seltzer, too.
Sam, play Send In The Clowns again
You look like Sparky, but I need to see some ID, sir.
Sorry, ten minutes until Crying On The Inside Hour.
I need a jerk, not a clown.
Have you tried Yuengling Brothers?
...and then they all left, and got into a car. A real little car.
I'm sorry we can't acommadate a party of twenty. But you can park your car and send them in ten at a time.
Sorry, we don't accept Master Clown.
I'm afraid I have to tell you the Ringling Brothers tab has been closed...
Don't worry, if the inauguration committee calls, I'll tell them you're not here.
What can I serve you, Mr President?
Can I get a Clown Royal on the rocks?
The Rabbi and the Priest are running late, so the joke is delayed.
For the last time, we're out of seltzer.
Last call for seltzer.
Beat it, clown, and don't come back without a priest and a rabbi. Nothing frustrates the customers more than an incomplete premise.
Stop clowning around. It isn't very Presidential.
You want a beer that tastes funny?
Uh...this is happy hour.
I'm sorry,. happy hour is over...
Wait, I've heard this one before.
I hear it's no circus for you.
You left the White House after just three weeks?
Nine for lunch, the others are just parking the car.
No, they walked into the bar yesterday
No, we do not carry the brand 'Clown Royal'.
Yes, somedays I do feel a little creepy. How about you?
You want whipped cream with that?
Barnum on the rocks?
I know you wanted to be secretary of housing and urban development. Sadly, Mr. Trump was able to find a less qualified candidate.
So a clown walks into a bar...
I had to call the cops on some bozo just last week.
I'm sorry sir, we do not stock Clown Royal.
There's always birthday parties.
You're scaring my customers.
Hard week on Twitter?
I don't care if you know Judy Collins, you can't come in.
Ever feel like your life is just a joke?
No, I think you're right—you can't compete with him.
The usual - a shot of whiskey with a cream pie chaser?
Did you expect the president to save the circus?
And what about the 17 still in the car?
I know you're in over your head, Mr. Trump. But they're going to find you eventually.
Yes this would be a dress code violation.
There's a very, very huge opportunity in the political circus.
We don't have a happy hour.
You've got something on your nose.
Happy Hour is not automatic just because you're here.
What's your pleasure?
Tell me if you've heard this one.
Sorry, we don't need any help. But with your qualifications, you could always run for office.
Sorry, we don't have happy meals.
Did you mean that funny-peculiar or funny-ha-ha?
Sorry. Bring in the clowns is just a song.
Can I see some i.d. please?
We stopped doing happy hours ago
You know they can't ask everyone to perform at the inauguration.
So you ran away and joined the circus. What happened after that?
My life is a joke.
Rough day at the circus?
Are you new to the D.C. area?
I'm sorry, but the management has decided that New York City can only serve one clown at a time.
No need to dress up. We get it, Mr. President.
Did that last drink taste funny to you?
We're all going to miss the elephants.
Like I said — yes, we can host private events, but our limit is 70 guests and I don’t care how many you think might fit.
The fat lady has sung.
You're just in time for Unhappy Hour.
Guess none of you guys ever ran before.
You wouldn't believe how many of your kind we can fit in here.
Congratulations on being nominated for Secretary of Education—first round's on the house!
A priest and a rabbi, you say? Nope. Doesn't ring a bell.
You can order a tiny Sidecar, but no sharing!
Those shoes,no service.
Mrs. Twinkles just called, she said the car's making funny noises again.
We're hiring a soda jerk, not a soda clown.
Thought you'd be in D.C.?
What can I get for you, Mr. Trump?
Have you heard the one about the circus leaving town?
You look like you could use two scoops!
Yeah, I did come across a little umbrella, but I put it in a Mai Tai a couple of hours ago.
Maybe it was the joke about "tiny hands and tiny crowds" that got you fired from Trump's birthday party?
Laughter is not always the best medicine.
Do you have experience with any beverages besides seltzer?
Let me remind you the Constitution says there can be only one clown at a time.
This one's on the tent.
Congratulations on your Cabinet confirmation! Drinks are on the House.
The other thirty parking the car?
Well, I hear they're hiring down in Washington.
These days people have short attention spans. We only have happy minute now.
Really? I'd have thought job fairs in your field would be hilarious.
Been to the inauguration?
Orange with white eye rings, wild comb-over, long tie, disproportionate extremity size? Been a rash of clown sightings lately, Patches, but you're still my favorite.
Promoted! Big shoes to fill!
Yea, I remember the good old days when clowns were funny.
You just missed happy hour, pal.
Just when I start opening doors, they send YOU in.
Joking or non-joking?
Quit clowning around and show me some ID
So this clown walks into a bar . . .
Hey don't worry, it's in good hands. Congress is working on the Affordable Clown Act.
A glass of seltzer water? You must think I was born yesterday.
Sorry but we don't hire clowns -- why don't you run for president?
Sorry, Buttons. You're cut off until your seltzer tab is paid.
So how is your Confermation Hearing going?
A clown walks into a bar? I thought that was only a myth.
It's been kind of a circus in here too.
I don't take funny money.
Happy Hour has been repealed.
Of all people to ruin happy hour!
Who are you calling a jerk, clown?
Why do you think you are not qualified to become president?
No Happy Hour for you until you turn that frown upside down.
One for the road, Mr President
He's Giving Clowns a Bad Name.
Do you want that with seltzer?
Well, until you walked in, my friend, it WAS Happy Hour.
Do you want a Ringling, a Barnum, or a Bailey?
The 32 other clowns got into the car and left ten minutes ago.
Do you like Green eggs and ham?
'Post-irony hour' does have a certain ring to it.
"Where are your buddies, the priest and the rabbi?
I'm not sure if that's what they mean by "anonymous" at those meetings.
You want a Trump wine? How about, "The media doesn't like me, wah, wah, wah.
So, any idea why the mortuary let you go ?
23 burgers for one car?
We're out of seltzer
Sorry. Your photo ID looks faked.
I told you absinthe doesn't make it grow fonder.
I am gonna have to see some ID
Bozo just left, but the President is still here.
If Ringling Bros. doesn't work out there may be an opening in the Trump administration.
I wasn't picked for the President's cabinet either.
Wait, I thought the clown was in the White House.
Listen clown, I'm no jerk.
I think you should run for office.
So how did they export the clown jobs?
Missed the Inaugural Parade, eh?
'Boozo The Clown'
Take out for how many in the car?
yeah, we serve clowns, just not your kind of clown.
You know, if it weren't for the flower, you would look just like the President of the United States.
No. Trump Tower is three blocks over.
You've had too much to drink to drive your thirty friends home in that tiny car.
Sorry, You just missed Sad Hour!
Sorry, bud, things just aren't funny anymore
I know who you are. You're one of the new Cabinet members.
For the last time, we're out of seltzer.
I hear you buddy, but remember, only fools fall in love.
Before I can serve you I need to ask if you're crying on the inside
I don't care if you're old enough to drink, this photo ID looks nothing like you.
Don't be glum. Whenever a circus closes down, a cubicle opens up.
Congratulations,on your position in the new Administration.
Hold the seltzer?
ID?
He adopted your clown act, maybe you should adopt his president act?
Happy hour? Never heard of it.
Don't blame the elephants, you weren't that funny anyway.
Look, I believe you could do it. I'm just telling you the fire marshal says we can't have more than 40 people in here.
Your kidding, they outsourced your job!
A Bailey's on the rocks?
You MIGHT get confirmed, but those senators can be tough.
You're a bit late, I 86'd the priest and the rabbi about an hour ago.
Sam I am. And I do not like clowns in a pub or in a club.
Something light and hoppy with a rounded nose?
Tough day, Senator?
New clown in town getting you down?
So a clown walks into a bar...
What is your pleasure now that the circus has moved to Washington?
You've been upstaged.
So, seltzer in a bottle.
Happy hour doesn't start until 5.
For the last time, no, we don't serve pie.
You don't really understand the point of "happy hour", do you?
I understand, my wife tells me I'm a clown too.
Dour Hour starts in five minutes.
I haven't laughed since the election
All out of seltzer, but I do have the less funny Perrier.
Just to warn you in advance, I run a serious business.
All my customers are nothing but clowns and none of them get free drinks either.
DC's gonna be a circus.
Set me up with your best bottle of seltzer and keep them coming.
Sorry I'm all out of seltzer. Would you care for some confetti in a bucket?
You're okay but I'm not serving your imaginary friend.
We don't carry any imported seltzer
So you lost your job to a congressman?
You think I'm funny how?
So when did you first suspect Mrs. Bozo had eyes for the Human Cannon Ball?
So when do you start at the DNC?
So you're telling me the Fat Lady got up and really belted one out.
Another circus on the rocks?
Decided not to sit out the inauguration, Congressman?
Sorry, we don't serve politicians here.
I played it again already.
Sorry, but happy hour doesn't start until five.
This job is easy; you won't have to jump through any hoops.
Let me guess. You want a wine with a big red nose.
I think you're dressed perfect for your new job at the White House.
"It's OK to cry in your beer, everyone else does".
All I'm sayin' is, look on the gloomy side now and then.
You must be joking!
OK, I'll pour you one, but don't blame me if it tastes funny.
I hear there's a gig at the White House.
Normally, I'd say no. But if it's just you and a few of your friends in that VW parked outside...
Ever get the feeling you've become a cliche'?
Sorry, I can't guarantee an hour of happiness.
Hey, bozo, you gonna order something?
Your buddies out in that tiny car?
Let's get this straight. I'm not Sam and you're not Bozo!
Happy hour doesn't start until 4 PM.
Sit a spell. Tell me about the time when kids thought clowns were funny.
What do you mean my protection money's late?
Quit clowning around and order.
You're funny how?
First, promise, no seltzer down my pants.
B&B on the rocks?
Sorry, pal. You just missed Sad Hour.
I meant I need a "soda jerk."
Sir. I knew Chuck Schumer, and you are no Chuck Schumer.
What'll it be? A pie in the face or a kick in the butt?
Of all the gin joints in Coney Island you had to walk into mine?!
Finally, a customer that dresses his part.
Look, if you're going to sit at the counter, you gotta order something besides seltzer.
My customers aren't really interested in balloon animals. Unless those balloon animals were to start buying rounds.
Yea, I heard the Greatest Show on Earth is closing. Have you thought of politics?
I'm all out of banana cream pie.
Has anyone every told you that you have "resting disillusioned" face?
Sorry, we're all out of seltzer water.
I was going to be able to collect unemployment, but now I have to be President
No, I don't have Royal Clown Cola.
Oh no--Existentialism is back.
As the clown continued to the stare at him, Sam couldn't help but wonder if he was staring into the face of the future leader of the free world. #Clown2020
Have you thought of running for political office?
Sorry...Happy Hour is already over.
That would depend on the size of the balloon.
So how'd he take it when you dropped out of the Inauguration Ball?
So which fake media outlet did you come from?
I can pour the seltzer in a glass and hand it to you, but I can't put it in a bottle and spray you in the face with it.
Happy Meal? Not here, buddy.
Sorry, I turned down two Ringling Bros. clowns just last week. I hear there are plenty of opportunities in Washington.
Actually, I think you have a GREAT shot at becoming commander-in-chief!
You were not what I had in mind when I advertised for help at happy hour.
Not another one of those unemployed clowns!
Welcome to happy hour
You're depressing our happy hour crowd.
I'm going to have to start charging you for club soda.
Squirt me again and just see what happens. Clown.
We don't need a Trump impersonator.
'Send in the clowns'? Really?
Ten bucks to park the elephant and you clean up afterwards.
No, I can't just spray you with the seltzer bottle.
So you're a clown who's afraid of clowns?
Happy hour is no joke around here.
It's nice to have you with us, Mr. President.
Yes, we do have the beers of a clown.
You're the fifth guy from Trump Clown University in this week.
Do you have a designated driver for the little car?
You've got that "I made a school go on lockdown today" face again.
Even without a glass, we still charge for seltzer water.
The last time I hired a clown he ended up at the White House!
The hat and orange hair should be fine, but if you want to run for President you should cut back a little on the makeup.
Is this some kind of joke?
The good news? Every other show on earth moves up one spot in the rankings.
Couldn't compete with the real thing. Sad!
No, we can't accept balloon animals as payment!
Yep, the circus is going on down the street in front of the capitol building. If you hurry, you can be part of it.
No, I don't need any help here. However, maybe you could run for president.
I served with Barnum and Bailey; you're no Barnum or Bailey
Sorry, we don't serve political parodies.
No more seltzer.
Are you here for our Happy Hour
"A clown walks into a bar?" Is that the joke or the punchline?
Sorry, we closed Ringling's tab.
Vodka Soda hold the seltzer?
No joke, no money, no service
I see you are here for happy hour.
What do you mean, it tastes funny.
You're lucky, nothing grows on mine.
You brought your own seltzer?
I don't care who you are, it's not happy hour.
Beat it. My Happy Hour's happy enough.
One bottle of seltzer, coming up.
Yeah, It's Happy Hour. We don't need to make it "Great Again."
I feel like Sam would have said something about a son.
Clowns to the left, Jokers to the right; where do your politics lie?
Sorry. No shoes or big shoes, no service.
I hear rodeos are hiring.
Why so glum? The circus just started.
A Bailey's on the rocks?
Too bad about Ringling Brothers! Have you considered a career in politics? America loves scary clowns!
I always thought it was a big waste of seltzer.
It was the elephants, don't take it personally.
Laid off after 146 years - that's rough.
I'm juggling my options.
Ethel, your brother is here to see you again.
Sorry, happy hour's over.
Sorry to hear that Barnum and Bsiley is closing down, but cheer up. I hear that Trump is hiring clowns.
Nope; I can still tell it's you, Mr. Cosby.
So what if your father thinks you're a clown?
Happy hour doesn't start for another 45 minutes.
Too bad the Senate didn't confirm you. How about a beer?
There's no discount for bringing your own seltzer bottle, Claribel.
This has to be a joke.
You want to go where everyone knows your name, Bozo.
The usual Senator Schumer?
Remind me again what you do for a living?
Lucille, we can't go on meeting like this.
Turn around. You're double-parked, and all twenty of your buddies are getting tickets.
Stop me if you've heard this one, "A clown walks into a bar...."
Looks like you decided to make the red nose work for you.
Remember you promised me - no funny stuff.
Sorry. We no longer have Barnum and Baileys on tap.
No, I've never heard every time you hear a bell, you're supposed to give a clown a shot of 18-year Glenfiddich
You look like I feel.
Sorry buddy, but the disher washer job has already been filled by the elephant.
I think you'll fit right in at the White House
I just checked, and no one from last night found a giant squirting bow tie.
You're a little early for happy-hour...
I told you to be here during Sad Hour at 3 pm.
No shirts, no shoes, no squeakers, no service.
The blonde, priest, rabbi and dog just left by Uber.
Sorry you didn't get the gig, buddy. The powers-that-be must of decided that one Bozo is enough for the inauguration ceremony.
Little early for Happy Hour, aren't you Buddy?
I'm all outta seltzer, but I do have a 1984 Pellegrino.
Better hurry. The Volkswagen is leaving.
I'm sorry, we're out of seltzer water. Can I interest you in a creme pie?
I can't serve Trump voters.
Sorry. We're no longer offering the sad clown discount.
There's always the rodeo.
You might not like to hear this. But if the shoe fits, wear it.
OK, OK, Arvin, the circus closed, but you can always go back into Politics.
Times change. The circus is now on Twitter.
Today's Special: Banana Cream Pie.
Now that Ringling Bros. is shutting dowm, you'll just have to find a job in Washington.
Donald, I see you're still in the same line of work!
Got it, anything but seltzer.
no, I will not smell your flower
Welcome to the Cabinet.
It has been a tough year for clowns, except for that one who got into the White House.
Stop me if you've heard this one.
I'll serve you a beer, I'll serve you a shot, but you're never getting another seltzer.
Sorry, we don't serve your archetype.
So you walked into a bar and . . .
The inauguration's next week.
Sorry; this happy hour.
I hear the State Department is hiring...
Desert specials today are pie-in-the-face and banana-peel. What'll it be?
So how'd you break your funny bone?
I heard about Ringling Bros. First one's on me!
How do I know this is your ID?
Out of twenty clowns, you're the designated driver again?
Hey, no political statements allowed in here!
Pagliacci want a cracker?
Look, pal ... it's like I told you, I ain't seen no priest or rabbi.
Preparing for the inauguration?
We don't serve Clown Royal.
There is no drink called a Clowney McClowface
What is this, 'Undercover Boss'?
I can't hire you- clowns are trending creepy.
Yes, we're out of seltzer water. Why?
Squeaky horn or something stronger?
Congratulations on your cabinet appointment! This beer is on the house!
I don't like this political circus either
...so take your mom's advice bud, don't do what I did. Don't run off and join a diner.
Sorry, we don't accept funny money.
You might consider rebranding.
Happy Hour?
I'm only allowed to serve the seltzer in a glass, not down your pants.
I already told you--we only have seltzer on draft.
It's happy hour, not crying on the inside hour.
What can I get you, Deputy Secretary? On tap, I have Cabinet Conundrums, Megalomaniac, and Four-Year Inferno.
Like I said before, no more seltzer for you.
Cheer up. You got 10% of the vote in the battleground states.
I don't care if you're a cabinet nominee, we're closed.
When she told me she was screwing a clown I thought she was joking.
You’re too late for happy hour.”
I will let you back in this time, but no more clowning around
Just give me your order and stop clowning around
They told me I had pretty big shoes to fill.
Nothing sadder than a sober clown.
A seltzer water and one whole creme pie ...
You could always tell Donald "no." And even if the Senate does confirm you, you can still make people laugh. Scalia did all the time.
I'm sorry, we're all out of Clown Royal.
I see you're upset. I think.
Yep, long time. So how's mom?
I need to see more than a clown car license.
A clown walks into a bar and the bartender says, 'So why the long face?'
Sam? So you really did join the circus.
I've seen you're type before. You can start part time, but any funny business and you're out.
Sorry, I need to hire a soda jerk , a soda clown isn't what I need .
Only if you can drink it out of your hat.
Seltzer, sure. How about a glass this time, okay, buddy?
Well now that Ringling Brothers is out of business, you could always get a job with the Trump administration!
Sorry. No absurdly oversized shoes, no squirting boutonniere, no service.
You can't come in here all seltzered up and acting like a clown and ask for a job.
Bubble gum, vodka and cotton candy on the rocks, you got it.
'I'll have a whiskey and a glass of water for my hat."
Sometimes the only thing you can do is laugh about it.
If it makes you feel better, a few people have started calling last night 'The Greatest Show on Earth'
Sorry Mr. Trump. We don't serve clowns here.
So being shot from a cannon was the high point of the week eh?
You'll have the unusual?
You know, if it weren't for your drinking problem, you could become president.
Oh man, not this clown again.
You might as well have another beer pal...I just heard on the news all His Cabinet posts are filled.
Sorry, not all cabinet nominees get confirmed.
O.K., deal. You settle your tab and I don't show at your confirmation hearings.
Another one? One of those 14 guys in that car of yours better be the designated driver.
Can I see an ID?
No, you're not the President of the United States, you're a clown.
We don't serve clowns - ex-circus, creepy or otherwise. Try the Capitol.
You think you're funny, don't ya?
So you want fifteen beers as soon as the rest of the clowns get out of the car.
The Crazy Clown Club has moved to DC.
Bad day to join the circus?
Seriously? You are running away from the circus to live on a Midwest farm?
You can't miss it. It has a big white doom. And there will others like yourself there.
You some kind of comedian?
I think you've had a few too many, Bozo...let me call you a clown car.
You won't get served here until you turn that frown upside down.
Sorry, happy hour doesn't start until 5 o'clock.
Things will be looking up for you after January 20th.
I could use a soda jerk.
It used to be a circus in here.
If I see you pulling out a seltzer bottle, you better be freshening your drink, hear me?
Pie and seltzer, in the face -- anything else I can do ya?
Happiness here, buddy, comes at a price.
Are you being serious?
I can't serve you, you make the other customers feel funny.
Later tonight, this place will be a real circus!
I'll give you the seltzer, you can do what you want with it.
The usual, Boozo?
With your skills why not try Washington D.C.?
Give me a song, give me a dance then I'll put seltzer down your pants.
Sorry, Bob. You just missed happy hour.
No, Stephen Sondheim certainly did _not_ send you.
Hi, Chuck, on your way to the inauguration?
Welcome to S'MAS. I am S'mas.
Happy hour isn't 'til 5 o'clock.
Squirt me with that daisy and I'll hose you with seltzer.
No, you can't take your vote back.
Closed after 146 years. Tough break. How about a squirt of seltzer, on the house?
Now that the circus closed, maybe I'll apply at the White House.
No more circus no more credit.
Sorry, we reserve the right to refuse funny business.
My life is a joke.
All the good circuses are moving over seas
Sorry, we don't serve your type of humor.
Well - we do pay more than peanuts.
Sorry, we don't serve sad-faced clowns during happy hour!
It's Happy Hour, Beppo! Sad Hour isn't til midnight!
What ale's you?
I've already heard this one.
If that flower squirts me you are outta here.
There's no way you can compete with the scary clown in the White House.
Well Donald, how's the president gig working out?
Just because you're the president now doesn't mean you get a free soda.
We don't serve politicians here.
Many other voters feel the same
What, you're the only one Trump didn't offer a cabinet position?
Orange sherbet, as usual, Mr. President?"
Sorry! No discounts for members of the presidential inaugural committee.
I'm serious: No funny business in this bar.
The Trump victory party is tonight at 8 o'clock, Mr. Roberts.
Don't worry, Mr. Trump. Your secret is safe with me.
Face it. It is your circus. Those are your monkeys.
Oh well 146 years that's a pretty good run.
I'm afraid I can't seat you until your entire party arrives.
Yes, Mr. President?
The circus closed, and I'm sad, but I'm going to make America laugh again.
The White House?, just take a right down the street, go five blocks and turn left on Pennsylvania Ave, Mr. President.
You doing the innaugaration?
I really don't think 'creepy hour' would be an effective promotion, but thanks anyway.
Now who's the jerk?
Last one to blink drinks.
Another seltzer, Mr. President?
Oh, sorry, I thought you knew the circus was closing.
I'm sorry, there has to be at least three of you walking into my bar.
I guess I don't have to ask where you've been all these years.
I'm sorry to hear the new guy in the White House has already filled the position.
Isn't it rich? who sent you in?
No balloon animals, no beer!
Tough night, lurking in the woods?
If you can juggle, it's on the house.
Wait, I think I've heard this one before.
You'll learn. It's basically sweep, lights out, close.
And where do you want that seltzer?
We're out of seltzer
There's no work here, my customers prefer feeling embittered.
Last call before Happy Hour.
That shirt, big shoes....no service.
So, the circus is really closing for good? Cheer up! Many new opportunities are opening up for clowns these days.
No, I didn't know that circus performers were being displaced by self-driving clown cars. Tough break!
So, let me get this straight. You were at an inauguration with your hand on a stack of Bibles, you bolted, and now you want bourbon and a beer.
Putting on more make-up will not make you look 21.
I was just joking. Some of my best friends are clowns.
Cathy's been looking for you.
You heading the the Clown Lives Matter rally?
You are the fifth guy today that's ordered a pie in the face.
So she's been seeing the elephant trainer again, eh Rusty?
Er...so where's the priest and the rabbi?
MILDRED; off with that silly costume!!! I don’t have a girlfriend, I just work nights.
One Bar-rum and Bailey's, coming up.
Sorry, fella. We don't serve new leaders of the free world in here.
Pop, you know those are some big shoes to fill.
We don't have "Clown Royale". How about a Ringling Lager?
Too bad Bozo, you're act's no match for the one at the White House.
Is this a political statement?
I know how this works, I comp one drink and pretty soon there's five dozen more of you.
Come back to work, Sam.
Is it Casual Friday already?
So you're here for Fashion Week.
They're craft. They all kinda have a funny taste.
I heard they closed you guys down, try Washington, DC.
Sorry buddy, we don't serve presidents here.
Ringling Bros. may not need you anymore, but we'll always need new politicians.
I got the whiskey if you got the seltzer.
The World Economic Forum is that way.
The other 12 clowns in the car got mad at you!
Wrong place. The DNC is next door.
Hey Joe, looks who's back, the guy who always complains his drink tastes funny.
Look, why don't you hand me your keys, and I'll call a comically tiny cab for you and your 27 buddies.
I'm sorry, we don't hire Bozos like you.
Our Inauguration Special is on the bitter side. I think you'll like it.
Sorry, no carry outs. You'll just have to invite the other 27 guys in the car to join you.
That's not funny
Not my circus, not my clowns
I think it's time to get serious about your drinking problem.
Nice hat, Mr. President.
Besides dispensing seltzer, do you have any other experience?
No, the drinks aren't cheaper if you want to use your own seltzer water.
Alone or are your other ten colleagues still in the car looking for parking?
You want peanuts with that?
The last clown I hired ran me out of seltzer.
If I were the only act to show up to the Trump Inauguration-I'd want to go on a bender too.
I suppose you think this is funny.
Why the glum face? One of your people is president.
The last clown I served here ran off with my first first wife! Can I buy you a beer?
We don't accept funny money.
So this clown walks into a bar . . .
Come on, you know I can't serve you knowing you gotta drive ten other guys to work later
You want a free beer? Is this some kind of a joke?
Love to turn that frown upside down but it's not in my job description.
What's a clown like you doing here?
No, Happy Hour is 6-7pm only
You want it with creepy fries or a sad salad?
So, are you another Trump Impersonator?
We're The Greatest Show on 5th and Maple
Sorry I took so long, it's just been a circus in here, all day!
I beg your pardon. I assumed you people always brought your own seltzer.
Happy Hour's over!
It'll take more than a hat with a flower it to fool people Mr President
This used to be a clown bar but it's under new management.
Don't worry, I'm sure the new administration will make your show the great again.
Say, ain't you that clown that got impeached?
Hillary, how's your new career going?
one tears of a clown coming up
Come back for a job application request in four years, please, the position has been filled.
Just you?
Sad, happy, or the usual?
Sorry to hear you weren't confirmed as Secretary of the Interior.
This is the gay clown bar.
Sorry, we don't serve members of President Trump's cabinet.
Time to put on your Happy Face!
You're not the type of soda jerk I had in mind when I wrote the ad.
You know you have a problem when your flower shoots sparkling wine.
I've seen creepier, so what'll you have?
First you'll have to fill out the Pie Transaction Form, then wait until the background check is completed.
What are you, some kind of clown?
Look, you can only make a first impression once
Look, I'll serve you seltzer but I ain't sprayin' it in your face.
Welcome to S'MAS.
No funny business
Looks as though the circus left without you.
Shirley Temple? Really? No wonder they call you Bozo.
Happy hour's come and gone I'm afraid.
Well, that's it for 'Happy Hour'.
Okay, I'll bite. Who's there?
Is that with or without the whipped cream?
You want one of those little umbrellas? Order a Mai Tai.
Seltzer? Sure, we have seltzer.
It's okay pal, I won't laugh.
No Bozo, we don't have any clown Royal.
What'll it be bozo?
Tell the rest of the gang waiting in that little car that I’m not coming back.
We're closing too. It's the big elephant in the room.
I didn't leave the circus. The circus left me.
Let me guess, you're a member of the new Presidents' cabinet.
I know you're juggling a lot these days, but would it kill you to text me back?
We tell all our customers, no smile no service.
I'm sorry, Mr. Trump. This is not "Uncle Sam's".
I know a setup when I see one.
Sorry, we don't take funny money.
Don't feel bad. They're sending all sorts of jobs to Mexico and China these days.
There's nothing funny about alcoholism, Jim.
No, the ad said, "We'll give a free drink to the best gown."
I'll have a large coke to go and forty straws!
So they made you perform at the inauguration?
Don't worry. When your wife called, I told her the place was full of clowns tonight.
Hi, Mom.
I'm sorry to hear about the car crash...did any of the other 57 passengers survive?
If you're trying to scare me you really should put your pants back on.
Yeah, I heard...ok, this one's on me.
I'm not going to trust you with a seltzer bottle again!
I'd like to hire you but the clown in the back said no.
Of course we do Happy Hour .
Are you kidding me?
I need a drink, Sam. America's turning out to be not so Great Again.
Happy hour's over, sorry.
Mr. President, how good to meet you!
I'm afraid. I can't serve you.
A clown walk into a bar...yeah, I've heard it.
Where is the rabbi and the priest?
Why the red nose?
No, you don't qualify for 24/7 Happy Hour
Would you like your drink circus-sized?
Would starting Happy Hour early help?
Sam, as an undercover boss, the outfit doesn't work.
Another round of boos?
Yeah, maybe you could be President.
Hate to break it to ya, chum, but we're all out of seltzer.
I don't give a damn about Ringling Brothers, a beer is still two dollars.
Sorry about your recent layoff from Ringling Bros. I'm not hiring, but Congress would be perfect for someone like you.
Nope, never heard of a drink called "Seltzer in the Face." Can you show me?
Make it a double, Sam. I work with a bunch of clowns.
You don't scare me.
I'm going to need a large tray, there's 16 of us double parked in the VW across the street.
I think you've had enough, Mac. That's three bottles of seltzer today.
You missed happy hour by five minutes.
I'm sorry sir, but happy hour's over
That's it -- I'm cutting you off. No more seltzer!
Buddy , I don't need you to tell me that the circus has come to town .
Happy hour's at four.
Is that the Priest and the Rabbi coming in you're supposed to meet?
who are you calling a jerk you clown
No, I can't rig it to squirt vodka.
Sam, I overreacted and went for the juggler.
Clown walks in? That won't cut it, pal. We've raised the bar.
Not funny.
How many times do I have to tell you that we're out of seltzer?
I understand. Now there's nothing funny.
We no longer host happy hour.
Any matches on tinder yet?
Go ahead. Squirt me again with that flower.
Can I get you anything Mr.Trump?
I don't have anything against clowns, it's just concerning when they're being elected president.
One bottle of seltzer, neat.
I'd suggest the Creepy IPA.
No sir , dressing up is not required for Happy Hour.
Come back when it's Presidents' Day.
We only serve beer to those who are 21, and act like 21, and dress like 21.
I heard the layoffs may not be over with the elephants.
Hey buddy - why so down in the mouth?
So which one are you? The Jewish clown, the Catholic clown, or the Muslim clown?
What happened to this place? It used to be a circus.
Do you know how many clowns, like you, I've had to turn away this month?
No, we don't have a set price for a carload.
We don't serve Ringling here.
What's with the stupid flower?
What happened that caused you to get into politics?
The inaugural performance could really catapult your career.
Are you the designated driver of the clown car?
They've sent in a scarier clown.
Can you be trusted with seltzer?
No seltzer for you!
Nobody does seltzer water in bottles anymore pal, it's all on tap.
Just because a clown walks into a bar doesn't mean I can solve your existential problems.
Sorry, we don't accept funny money.
I told you no funny business!
Sorry, no seltzer, just beer.
Sorry, but we're all out of the sidecar.
Sorry, our "Send in the Clowns" special was last week.
I see that Ringling Brothers is "Sending in the unemployable Clowns"
Stop me if you've heard this: "a clown walks into a bar..."
Sorry to hear it pal, but if you didn't really want the job, you shouldn't have run in the first place.
Sorry your blind date didn't work out again!
I wish I had a nickel for every time some sad clown came in here and tried to sell me that line of malarkey.
Read the sign, pal. No oversize shoes, no squirting flower, no service.
The soda jerk position has been filled.
Seltzer with mime, coming up.
It's not just you. It's your 37 passengers I'm worried about.
"Sorry pal. You're scary when you drink".
No, I'm not sure where the Electoral College is.
Sorry, we're the "psycho taxi driver" bar. The "creepy clown" bar is at Lex and 83rd.
How about a post-election scoop to turn that frown upside down?
Mother, I told you to stop checking up on me...
You won--what?
Don't worry. There might be another chance for you in 4 years.
Have you tried, 'Able to squeeze into very small cars.'?
One Clown Loyal on the rocks, please.
People no longer take me at face value.
Have you any experience in seltzer?
Why don't you apply for a job with the new administration.
Small car, 21 clowns, where'd you think your nose would go?
Easy on the seltzer.
You shouldn't take everything the president says so literally, Senator Schumer.
Didn't send in the clowns, huh?
The usual Senator Schumer?
Fear of bartenders?
Strange thirsty or funny thirsty?
No, you don't look gay. In fact, you don't even look the least bit happy.
Lemme guess, it's the politicians are taking our jobs?
Happy hour is over, Mr. Barnum
A little song, a little dance, a little seltzer down your… no, I couldn’t do that.
Buddy, I still need to see your id.
But your customers only cry with you in the beginning. Mine cry here all night long.
So, this is your alternative face?
Sorry. We serve clowns only on Inauguration Day.
Sorry President Trump, we don't serve clowns.
You just missed Sam--he left to join the circus.
We don't serve Trump supporters here.
Whatta ya want, the unusual?
Chuckles only works Happy Hour.
We call it The Scary Clown - all gin and no seltzer.
Are you a scary clown, a funny clown, or just one of the usual clowns who comes in?
Actually, I have to see your drivers license with your clown picture on it.
Your seltzer or mine?
Have you considered career counseling?
I might be able to use someone who knows how to clean up the peanut shells...
OK, NOW tell me why you don't think you could be elected president.
If you say "Play it again" I'll punch you in your red, bulbous nose.
You're hired. Now get busy goofing around.
Ringling Brother casualty, huh?
You have big shoes to fill. Our last clown was funny and had no pre-existing conditions.
What drinks do you know besides seltzer?
I'm so tired of you bozos coming in here, looking for a handout.
No, I don't think a clown would make for an even happier hour.
Right. You want me to make a drink that tastes funny.
Fifteen of your passengers told me not to serve you
No, I don't want to hear the one that got you kicked out of clown school.
Trump's America ain't so funny, is it?
A new circus is in town. You can apply in DC
No, sorry we don't accept animal balloons.
I know it's you Donald, it's still no.
When my father passed away I considered 'Son of Sam's'
I've no work for you here, but there may be a place for you in the current administration.
Two more and we'd really have a joke.
Have you thought of running away and joining the Cirque du Trump?
Hey, I just saw you on CNN at the Senate cabinet confirmation hearings. Are you HHS or EPA?
Nope, Bearded Ladies' Night was yesterday.
I hear there's an opening at the inauguration
What'll it be, Pagliacci?
Sorry, this is the 12" pianist joke. Try the bar down the street.
You just missed your friends. All 99 of them hopped a cab Uptown.
Honk once for ale, and twice for lager.
Pull my finger.
I can't give you a song, a dance, or seltzer down your pants. How 'bout a beer?
It's an honor to have you come in Mr. President.
I'm sorry, but we don't serve political impersonators here.
So I guess you don't want to hear the Happy Hour specials.
Ten cream pies and a diet soda, please.
Uh, no...that says 'lager on tap', not 'laughter'.
Which one of you bozos said the seltzer tastes funny?
That flower is a Forget-me-not? Believe me. No one who sees you will ever forget you.
Let me guess...you're hiding from your wife.
I do own the place, but I'm not exactly what you'd call a ringleader.
OK! I'M A JERK, YOU'RE A CLOWN, NOW WHAT DO YOU WANT?
Sorry, we're not hiring, but I hear City Hall is a real circus.
No, there's not one goddamn thing that's funny about it.
Would you mind not sitting in front of the window?
One Barnum and Baily Irish Cream coming up.
Little early for Happy Hour
So, just to be clear, then I throw it at you face?
Sorry, but we don't serve clowns anymore. People say they taste funny.
Look, pal, happy hour was two hours ago.
The ad said BOGO free drinks not BOZO drinks free.
I knew Sam. You're no Sam.
Sorry Barnum. We're closed too.
Would you like it in a glass or in your flower?
Well, maybe, next year.
Nice Trump imitation, but you still have to pay.
Why so grim?
If I serve you, I'll have to serve everyone in your clown car.
You keep this up, there will be one less clown in that car!
Very funny. Don't you usually work with a priest and a rabbi on this sort of thing?
Lose the flower, pal. He's president.
I'll have to charge you extra to spray the drink in your face.
Last month the elephants were here.
Why the red nose?
Sarsaparilla! Are you trying to be funny?
Your 50 friends tell me you're their designated driver.
Sorry about the circus closing, though I hear the new administration in D.C. is looking for folks like you.
Just remember, people will continue to laugh at you long after the Circus is gone.
Happy Hour?
You're not the only circus member to move into the White House
You look familiar, have you been here before?
Seltzer. Sorry. we're out.
How are your seltzer bottle skills?
I am Sam. Sam I am. I do not like giving drinks to clowns.
Sorry buddy, your work experience just sounds a little funny.
Where are the priest and Trump?
You didn't know 'clown car' was a metaphor?
The priest and the rabbit couldn't make it.
I have to cut you off, your ten friends in the VW parked outside told me you are the designated driver.
One pie with whipped cream and hold the pie?
After what happened last time, I can't give you the whole seltzer bottle.
I'm afraid you still haven't quite captured that happy hour spirit.
One Barnum and Bailey, in the rocks!
I'd chalk it up to bad career choice.....
You're shut off. I don't care if you really do have 22 designated drivers...
I know. It sucks being the designated clown car driver.
I'm cutting you off, Bozo. Your nose is all flushed.
Nope. This wouldn't be a Rockwell moment.
The sign says "Happy Hour."
Vodka seltzer, I presume?
Of all the beer joints in all the towns, in all the world you walk into mine.
Who are you calling a jerk, clown?
It was not a personal invitation from our patio speakers. It was Judy Collins's "Send in the clowns"
This is the happiest I've seen you since Election Day!
Where's Melania?
It's not my fault. I always took the kids to the circus.
Who's tab this time...Barnum's or Bailey's?
That disguise will not work Mr. Trump. No ethics, No drink.
It was worth a try but can we go back to normal Happy Hour now?
you know that really isn't much of a disguise Mr.President
One Soda Water In The Face coming up. Pretzels?
We're all sold out of inauguration pies.
Truth, you don't look like a happy drunk to me.
Sorry, we don't serve "seltzer water to the face."
I'm not afraid of you.
Cheer up, Dufus. We can't all be Bozos.
I'm sorry, we need an ID with a current photo.
Sorry bub, but you can't have a rubber chicken on your pizza.
The beer tastes funny. Are you kidding me?
I'm not surprised work has been slow for you since the election.
Please leave. You're scaring the customers.
Yup, you and me both. The last time I laughed at a New Yorker cartoon was the chicken that crossed the road to get a martini.
I'll get you the bourbon, buy you can supply your own seltzer.
You're going to have to stop drowning your sorrows in Helium.
What traumatic childhood experience led you to this?
Happy Hour starts at 4.
"Sorry, can't serve you. No clowns allowed in 'walks into a bar' jokes.
Yes, all of our beer tastes funny.
Sorry Jo-Jo, rules are rules. Happy Hour ended 10 minutes ago.
Why so glum, bud? Circus leave town or something?
Sorry, it may be Happy Hour out there all day for you clowns, but in here it's 4 to 6.
I don't care if you're the new Supreme Court Justice. No free beer!
Sorry. Happy hour isn't until 3:00 p.m.
What do you mean, 'yesterday's lunch tasted funny?'
You're funnier when you're sober.
Well, if you only have weekends off, chances are you won't run into the priest or the rabbi.
You should have been here last night, pal. It was a real circus!
No, I asked you to scare UP some customers.
Your usual?
Yep, Bozo used to come here all the time for cream pie.
Congratulations. You just killed Happy Hour!
I'm tired of you bozos asking if microbrews are the same size as regular beers.
Did you hear the one, "a clown walks into a bar..?"
You want a shot of seltzer down your pants ?
Why the sad face Bozo, is the new guy in the White House stealing your show?
Well, Ballantine has a nice three ring logo that might bring you some comfort.
I'm sorry but that's our policy. We can't serve seltzer to clowns.
Petite Shiraz? The others just wanted Seltzer to the face.
Whadda' mean you only want a seltzer bottle?
Sorry, S'ma sold the place about twenty years ago.
Have you thought of joining a circus and becoming a clown.
You just made my decision to end open mic night a lot easier.
I am not going to play it again.
No, I do not want to hear "Vesti la Giubba" from Pagliacci. It's cash only.
Yup, still creepy at age 54.
Well, this is the first time an actual clown has walked in here.
Of all the ginger ale joints in the world, you walked into mine
No, no. I ordered Crown!
did you hear about the clown who died and 14 of his friends went to the funeral in the same car
sorry sir, happy hour is over
You guys have it figured out. There could be twenty of you here, and you'd only need one designated driver.
Looks like you lost the bet.
Let me guess, 'Ringling Brothers'?
What exactly is a "Clownachino"
Boss man says no more seltzer refills until you buy something.
You couldn't take better care of the elephants?
There's always kids birthday parties
Bill, I still know you'll be an angry drunk
Is that you, Norm?
Are your seven buddies still in the V W bug?
Please tell me that was a whoopie cushion full of air and wet jello.
Custard pie? Plumb out.
I told you before, you're too early for the Happy Hour.
YOU WANNA TRY OUR NEW BEER? IT TASTES FUNNY.
My professional advice? Your problems cannot be cured by drinking.
Your job was offshored? What a joke.
Post-comedy era you say?
No, I don't want a spritz of water. I'm asking what you want.
The clown discount is only good while the Circus is in town!
No I am sorry, we don't have seltzer water in a bottle, only on tap, and no I won't pour it down your pants, sorry
I don't have anything that tastes funny
Sorry pal, three-ring minimum.
So, a refill of the sunflower, then?
Not sure where is the circus...but it you are looking for the Inaugeration...it is on the next block.
We're fresh outta seltzer!
You guys should have kept the elephants.
Nice disguise Bob. I still can't serve you.
Out of all seventeen friends I'm sorry you got stuck being the designated driver.
Yeah...gotta be hard to compete with the new Administration coming in...
Clown, I've got something that will turn that frown, upside down.
Tell your friend outside to quit walking on the power line.
Who's Cathy?
You'll need to hand over the bell and horn until you're ready to leave.
Sorry Buddy, the Inaugural Ball is down the street.
Yes, I know. A clown comes into a bar with a flower in his hat.
Man, get over it. You aren't clownish enough to be the new Secretary of Energy.
John, your perception of reality inspires all of us here.
Free drinks for clowns was last week...
Sorry, Happy Hour doesn't start for another 30 minutes.
I'd heard it was last call for clowns.
Happy Hour, there's no stinking happy hour
Hey bud, you trying to be funny?
Sorry, none of my stuff tastes funny. What else do you want?
We don't serve shaving cream pies.
A little seltzer in you pants?
Don't worry about the Dems . . . you'll still get the appointment.
Don't be down, you too could be the next president!
A spritz of seltzer down your pants is two bits.
Sorry, we're all out of seltzer. ... And cream pie.
This is the bar. You're the joke. I don't know what you're supposed to do next.
trust me, we can make sam's great again
Sure, they're all in an animal sanctuary now. But an elephant never forgets.
We don't serve drinks to sad clowns during happy hour.
I expected you later for happy hour.
Wait, you didn't know it was going to be a tragedy?
Well, I guess it's still Happy Hour.
...and one cannibal says to the other, "does this taste funny?"
Don't let it get you down, Sprinkles. The new President is hiring.
It's the show that won't go on, not your life.
You know they are looking for people just like you in Washington D.C.!
Sorry, we don't take any funny business here.
Pathos is dead.
I'm sorry. Clown jobs are not coming back, and the circus will not be made Great Again.
I am not serving the other 15 clowns in your car until see their IDs.
Sorry, we're outta seltzer
Why the wide face!
I see you've got a new look since your inauguration.
Can I get you something that tastes funny?
Are you guys hiring? My last gig just folded its tent
Sorry, no Happy Hour for sad clowns...
I'm sorry, this is a post-humor bar.
Buyer's remorse?
Maybe the world was not ready for a clown mortician.
Tough break. But, since the election, our clown residency is filled.
Do you know the one about why cannibals don't like clowns?
I get it, pal. Its just like when Austin Powers ruined the Bond franchise. It was inevitable Trump would ruin the circus. Shall I make it double?
No country for old clowns.
Scotch with a wine chaser? You can't be serious.
What do you mean? You are dressed perfectly for your new job in Washington.
I don't care that you're not wearing pants.
Another refill for the flower -- coming up. Nice to know that old gag still works.
It's like Bear Sterns all over again.
I sorry President Trump, I didn't recognize you without the orange hair.
What is this some kind of joke?
Bill, when I said we need to increase spirits, this is not what I had in mind.
I'm sorry-we're out of seltzer.
If that's as funny as you can be, we're going to have to ask you to leave.
Pastrami on white with mayo? That's not funny.
Heard you are in the on-deck circle for a cabinet appointment. You sure you want to put up with that circus?
'OK, one drink and back to the bank"
Your the third clown from Ringling's in here this week!
No, he won't play it again.
Not going to the inauguration,Senator Schumer?
Sorry, I didn't mean to step on your shoes.
It's a soda, jerk.
Sorry, we don't have Happy Hour on Mondays.
Well Chuckles, it looks like you finally had the last laugh.
Sorry pal, creepy clowns are just so 2016.
Stop clowning around Sam. I know it's you
Looks like now that the circus is closing, we'll be getting a bunch of real clowns in here.
It is pronounced "Smas".
Sorry--inauguration party's over.
Green eggs and beer? Not here! Not there!
Good God, no wonder people run from you.
No, I'm not joking...
A little Dutch courage for your confirmation hearing?
What do you mean: "You're having doubts about the election?"
Good luck with your inauguration.
You should apply for a Cabinet position.
No worries, everyone is a clown these days
So glad you dropped the orange mask, Mr. President. This is definitely the real you.
Hey, what's goin on, you're the third clown we interviewed today!
What's up, Boozo?
Did Mr. Trump send you?
I knew Sam. Sam was a friend of mine. You are no Sam.
You're too sensitive... I wasn't referring to you when I said some clown was terrorizing my patrons.
Sorry, but I don't think it's going to work out. That's not what I would call business casual.
My previous employer? Well, after a 146-year run, they came to the conclusion we wouldn't be able to compete with this new administration.
Sorry about the closing, maybe a cabinet position in the new administration.
Son, I knew you'd be back.
You want to return a milkshake because it tastes funny? What are you, some sort of clown?
So, you're a friend of Bozo. Who the hell is Bozo?
''Let me guess, a shot of depression and leave the bottle''.
You might try a Twitter account.
Let me guess. Seltzer on the rocks?
Do you have any experience other than throwing pies in people's faces?
Sorry...What exactly WAS your last tweet?
Can you at least paint a smile on your face?
Congratulations, operative. You successfully brought down the Ringling Bros. from the inside.
Sorry, but I just can't let you sit here for the next four years.
Tears won't get you a pint, I still need ID.
The police say the suspect is a giant, he has size 30 shoes!
Well for one, whoopie cushions don't smell.
Nice hat.
Before I can sell you some pie, I need to see some identification.
Where's the punch line?
Outta Send in the Clowns Ale but we got Transition Lager, it's very similar!
You'll have to leave, you're scaring the customers.
It must have been a real tough night cause the bottom half of your costume is missing.
Can't serve you any more drinks; you're starting to act like a clown.
Cheery coke?
NORM!!!
Sorry, seltzer refills start at 5:00 P.M.
Okay, so the tent folded. If I were you I'd send my vita to the White House.
I'm guessing you want the Ringlingtini?
Your clown problems are actually quite a respite from the other crap I've been getting.
Sure I'll vote for you next time.
You must be the designated clown.
We are all out of Seltzer, but can I smell your flower?
What do you mean our seltzer makes you feel funny?
Excuse me, I'm lost. Directions to the White House please.
I've got a seltzer bottle, too, y'know.
No. More. Cream. Pies. Period.
Nope....nothing on the menu that tastes funny.
Would you, could you with a grump? Would you, could you with a Trump?
It is not very often that a clown can put a damper on Happy Hour.
Hey, there's always Cirque Du Soleil.
You're still barred and I still don't think you're funny
Sorry, no sad clowns allowed at Happy Hour.
Aw, sorry, Sad Clown Happy Hour is from 2 to 3.
You miss the elephants, don't you?
I like the daisy.
Weren’t you in here last week at the drive-thru with like a dozen other guys?
Cheer up, Barnum. You can still perform at kids' parties.
You can't compete with the President? That's sad.
How 'bout a cream pie with that seltzer bottle?
Look, for the last time. We don't serve our beer with silly straws.
The election sure has sent in the frowns.
Read the sign, buddy. "CASH ONLY. NO BALLOON DOGS."
You didn't vote, did you?
I'm tellin' ya, to make it as a clown in the 21st Century you gotta think big.
Wait a second, I think I've heard this one before.
Uber driver? Maybe. But think about capacity.
No, funny guy, I'm not going to play it again.
Sorry pal, but we're all out of seltzer water
Yeah, I thought the name 'clown bar' would pack 'em in too
We're out of cream pies and seltzer.
I didn't think the end of days would have a sense of humor.
Why the long face, Senator Schumer?
So, hows the funny business treating ya?
We know the real best medicine.
I'm sorry that you lost your job with Barnum and Bailey and all, but I'm afraid this is 1600 Massachusetts Avenue.
Can I see your id?
What in Heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
They have 'Clown Light' on tap down the street.
You must be coming from doing that Parker kid's party. His parents were here all afternoon.
I know this is my moment, but what will you have Mr. President?
Have you tried calling a head hunter?
Don't look so glum, Grumpo. There's a new circus just came to town.
No, you may not have a seltzer.
Sure, now you're sorry for being so creepy
Hey, Donnie, what's this I hear about you changing your name to POTUS?
Sorry, I'm all out of the funny stuff.
I don't think you understood the concept of "get dressed up and go out for a drink."
Your friend-what does he look like?
Did you think the Circus would last forever?
It must be tough to be a cable news anchor.
Joe's not here but I can send in the clowns.
No normal shirt, no normal shoes, no service.
Listen Bozo, no funny business this time!
I think you'll do well in your new White House job
"...and I say, a President does pay his bar tab".
Do you see me laughing?
You didn't leave it here, I haven't seen a seltzer bottle in 25 years.
No Mr president we don't have Russian prostitute pee-pee on tap. Try Vladimir's down the street.
Sorry! We only serve happy clowns.
Don't worry -- there's still the possiblity of being the first respectable clown in the White House.
Trump's bus left 15 minutes ago.
Yes, I heard about Ringling Brothers closing...you didn't run into three drunk elephants on your way in?
I know the circus closed, but you look like a guy with a lot of possibilities.
I really mean it. I think there's plenty of room in the history books for a second clown president.
Where were you clowns before the elections....
Seltzer -- bottle or tap?
I had a funny feeling I would see you.
Good yuck with your job search.
No, I don't need any seltzer.
Your wife just called. She said not to forget to pick up the pies and seltzer water on your way home.
No, but I know the one about a horse that walked into a bar.
I know it's tough when an elephant sits on your best friend. Was he also a Democrat?
Please don't cry. We just don't have your flavor.
Personally, I don't think any of them taste funny.
Sorry, no discount if you provide your own seltzer.
And a cream pie at my face, please
Where nobody knows your name
No. I don't think anyone recognized you, Mr. President.
Would two more clowns in that little car have saved the circus?
Democrat ??
"Wanna hear something funny?".................
No, I don't think you're deplorable; I voted for him too.
I have the right to refuse circus to anyone.
It's 8:00 am. Happy Hour is from 3:00 to 6:00 pm.
The SIXTYS are over, Bud...They're NOT wearing Flowers in their Hair anymore!
I take it you're ready for Trump's inauguration.
Times have really changed, Norm.
Have you thought about looking in DC?
Yes, I believe you're Cathy's Clown.
I know, I did not vote either.
I hear ya, reality is my competition too.
I'm cutting you off. There are already enough clowns in your car.
I don't think I can go on without the elephants.
Yeah, life can be funny sometimes...
Sorry, we won't be serving presidential candidates for another 2 years...
... and there's always some bozo yelling, "Tastes great! Less filling!" Oh, sorry.
fake clown.
Scary hour seemed worth a shot.
When you heard "Send in the Clowns", just where were you?
So you say you have experience with soda bottles and your schedule is wide open?
It ain't Happy Hour
I know Trump is still hiring in DC.
Hey pal, I think you've had enough. Let me call you a clown car.
Would you like to try our hoppiest I.P.A?
Sorry, he just left for Washington.
No clowning around here, sir.
No. I can't serve everyone in your car.
Which of our three draughts would you prefer to cry in?
You've got another Hamptons kids' party, don't you?
I have to agree with you that hemorrhoids are no laughing matter.
I can tell you're only laughing on the outside
I'm sorry, sir, we only have pints or schooners - no 'spray into my face'.
Sure, you come back here with your fancy show-business ways, lording it over us, but you've forgotten who gave you your first seltzer bottle.
But ain't too much sadder than the beers of a clown when there's no one around.
You have a permit for that concealed selzer bottle?
I don't care if your best friend from college is the President, we're still closed.
Do clowns speak or tweet?
No snickers, no smiles, no service.
Look Bozo, we don't serve your kind.
You're sad because you broke your humerus? I don't get it, pal.
Sorry, we have no job openings here. But I heard they’re looking for people like you in Washington.
Confetti? Sure thing. Up? On the rocks? Or out of a cannon?
beers of a clown
You're cutoff. No more cream pies for you!
Before I serve you I must say...in lieu of the Inauguration...you seem more ironic than funny.
I like your disguise Mr. President.
How about I mix you everything into a creepy smoothie?
The ice cream shop was much closer than the circus when I ran away.
The service industry needs people with your skills, Bob.
You'd wouldn't believe how many fake IDs we see
Tell you what, you make me a balloon hat and the first one's on me.
I, too, am in the funny business.
So then she says that inside I'm really just a sad clown.
Do you want the seltzer mixed with your drink, or do you want me to spray it in your face?
It's a circus here in 2 hours.
Sorry, fake news,no free drinks for clowns
What'll it be, Senator Schumer?
Stop honking your horn-I will be right with you.
It's no use. Time to move into the White House.
How will I know if you need to be cut off?
Let me guess....a double seltzer on the rocks.
Sorry, happy hour doesn't start until 4:00.
Don't bother, I've heard them all before.
We don't serve politicians masquerading as clowns.
Responding to Send in the Clowns? Don't worry, Donald Trump is here.
NORM!!!
Cheer up, it's two minutes to Happy Hour
I heard that one before, but never from an actual clown.
The Senate Confirmation Hearings are up on Capitol Hill, Mr. Tillerson.
I heard Trump's hiring now that your Ringling Brothers gig is over
Seventeen people in he car and you're deaignated driver? That's tough luck.
From the Big Top to the Big Tap?
Still no call back on the Innaguration audition then?
I'm going to need to see some I.D.
I still don't think you caused the Greatest Show on Earth to close.
Money first.
Sing and dance all you want, but we're out of seltzer.
Sorry pal. You can't pay with your funny money.
You should have known there'd be performance issues when you began studying existential nihilism.
Drinking won't turn that frown upside down
What is this some kind of joke?
He looks qualified.
I have bad-hair-days too.
Yep. Smokey Robinson and the Miracles. C-9 on the Jukebox.
Are you one of the Deplorables?
After 146 years... What can I get you ?
Thanks for remembering to leave the elephant outside...
Sorry Bub, happy hour starts at 5pm.
I'm sorry sir, but the circus was just in town and I'm all out of Bailey's.
I was sorry to hear about the circus, but this place is for serious drinkers only.
I need to see an I.D. before I can serve a clown.
Forgive me, Sam, but it'd be better for business if you stayed upstairs in your office.
Wait, don't tell me, I've heard this one before.
Do you want me to play it again?
You run off and join the circus, and now, Sam, you want your old job back?
Whats a Balloon Teenie???
I read on Twitter you are headlining the inaugural ball.
Sorry but your funny is no good here anymore.
Sure, we serve clowns here. They're $7.95 a dozen.
I know. 146 years. The first one's on the house.
Well there's the id, the ego and the super ego...
Nice try Joe, you are still cut off.
We have a happy hour for the clinically depressed. Half-price drinks if you show a current prescription for a major depressive disorder
Sam?! Sam?! I thought you ran away to join the circus!
Listen Clown, I don't want any trouble, ya' hear?
We don't have the punch & judy anymore. May I suggest a harlequintini.
It's been a lot emptier since the joking ban.
I'm sorry we don't have anything that tastes funny...
I think the clown pant suit will give you away Mrs. Clinton.
So, you've come back, Sam.
I hate to tell you this but the fat lady has herpes.
Yeah, it used to be a circus in here too.
Ok Sam, I'm ready. . . send in the clown.
Nope, I'm out of seltzer...
I'm assuming you'd like the presidential special?
I'm sorry, we no longer have Happy, but I can swirl together Anger and Certainty.
No, happy hour doesn't begin until four.
Hey! Why the long face?
we don't serve your kind in here, you piece of shit. you motherfucker.
Try painting on a smile and see how that works.
What'll you have, Trumpo?
Bozo? I haven't heard that name in years.
On you or in you?
No, I won't give you a drink in exchange for a balloon animal.
A Clown Car on the rocks, Sam. And keep 'em coming!
I'm sorry but 'clown-con' is just not a thing.
You want soda with that, or did you bring your own?
We don't do seltzer bottles to go.
Why, George, don't you remember? 115th U.S. Congress, House Ethics Committee? You and me?
I'd hire you but I'm not sure if you have the right makeup for this job
No, I can't cram twenty scoops into one cone.
stop clowning around and order a drink.
I will still need to see your ID, there are plenty of underage clowns trying to get beer.
Stop clowning around.
Hey Donald, I didn't recognize you
No stilts, no service.
I told ya, pal - we don't serve seltzer here!
You look familiar . . .
Seltzer with a splash of seltzer?
No, I said that specific microbrew is a bit hoppy, not happy.
Go ahead...ask for something that tastes "funny" and see what happens.
I can't hide this bald spot with a hat anymore.
Happy hour doesn't start until 5.
Stiff one, Sam. I'm working the flower show.
Turn that frown upside down and maybe you can get happy hour prices.
We don't serve mocktails.
You're a clown, man! Forget the whiskey sour!
If you squirt me with that flower one more time I'm cutting you off. Stop it!
Yes, it does taste funny.
We don't serve whisky from lapel carnations.
Sorry about the circus gig. How about going into government?
Time to wet your whistle?
Ok, so the rabbi, the priest, the Mexican , the guy with the really small head , the lesbian and the horse are out in the car . Right ?
I'm sorry, we just don't serve the liberal media in here anymore.
Enough with the seltzer buddy. I'm cutting you off.
Well at least you had a job for 100 years.
All the money...and make it quick. I have 10 getaway drivers waiting for me outside.
How may I turn that frown upside down?
Let me guess -- you need a pick-me-up.
fake clown.
Maybe Trump will force Ringling Brothers to stay in business.
Gee, Bozo. You've had a rough week...First the circus closes, then the clown car arrives in Washington without you. Lemme get you a bottle of our best seltzer...
Why so sad?
Yes, the "kiddie" party is upstairs but no, I can't give you a Scotch to-go cup.
Seriously? You're Sam?
"I'm sorry about Barnum and Bailey, but I just don't need any help right now".
Why the wide face!
The Inaugeration was two weeks ago.
What does THIS clown want?
Need a job?
Now that the circus is closing,you need to think outside the big top.
So...out of one job and straight into another.
Not hiring here, but you might consider a career in politics.
Yeah.... I heard about it.... Maybe you could go into politics - it's worked for countless other clowns!
You have got to be kidding!
I don't get it.
I'm not giving you that seltzer bottle again.
What party are you looking for? Republican or Democrat.
Shut down? You're joking! I just saw a bunch of you parading down Pennsylvania Avenue.
Sorry, since the inauguration we no longer tolerate humor here.
" If we do happen to need a pie server I'll keep you in mind".
Yeah, Sam I am, Bozo.
The clown who came before you took all the seltzer.
Table for 52?
Beer only. No seltzer.
.......but first, give us a BIG smile !
A clown walks into a bar . . .
Don't take this personally, but you forgot to put on lipstick.
No, not your clown ID.
You'll still have to pay, even if it tastes funny
Funny thing...we're out of soda...
Look Donnie, there's no question - you're entertaining. It's just that my Uncle fears that you're scaring the adults.
It's okay. With Ringling shutting down, you're free to clown around here.
Have you tried Cirque du Soleil?
Don't bother, Harry...they're here.
...and what do you think we can expect for the SECOND week of the new administration?
I'm sorry, but clowns are not a protected class and you're scaring away all my customers.
At least give us a painted-on smile.
Yes, there is more than one Sam's Club in this town.
Would you like that drink in a dribble gkass?
No, no Pagliacci; how about a gelato?
I thought you didn't drink.
It's starting to wear a little thin, Carl.
I definitely know who you are and I will NOT SERVE YOU A "WHITE RUSSIAN".
You have any humor on tap?
I know. I didn't vote for him either.
Alright, send in the clown.
Oh spare me. Let me tell you, bartenders have tears too.
The new Norm
So the circus called it quits, and the birthday business is on the skids; do you know how to write code?
There's two more due to arrive, right?
It's like I always say...you need a good fall back plan.
Do you have anything that will give me my life back?
Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, you walk into mine.
The usual, Sam: Confetti on the rocks.
And where would I get a spritzer?
Sorry but I am all out of Soda Water
Maybe they should've kept the elephants.
I'm not like those other Bozos who come in here every afternoon.
I don't know; have you tried Cirque du Soliel?
I would have gone with a carnation.
You want seltzer with that?
Angry calls from your constituents got you down again?
Barnum & Bailey's Irish Cream, huh? Very funny.
I thought he was in Washington this week.
Yes, I understand you want to go where everybody knows your name, but they're just not always glad you came.
A shot of whiskey costs 7 balloon animals.
We don't serve Bozos like you here.
We're getting more complaints about Happy Hour
Tell me again about your position in the new Administration.
I need you to cheer up my customers because they drank all the liquor before the inauguration.
Make me laugh and I'll take your order.
I'm going to say it for the last time, pal - Smile, it's Happy Hour.
Luke, I am your father.
Don't blame my food because you feel funny.
Sure...you're only going to DRINK a bottle of seltzer.
You want a cup of clown chowder?
Did the gumbo taste funny to you?
Chocolate on a hamburger? What you trying to be funny?
If you squirt me with that flower, you'll get a golden shower.
Yeah, being a happy clown is my alternative fact.
Sorry, we don't serve multi-coloreds.
One gluten free creampie and organic seltzer, coming up.
We are not hiring right now, but good yuk with your job search.
Stop clowning around and " Order"
Just, you know, you’re funny.
Yeah, I want to see your I.D. I'm just curious - that's all...
"A little seltzer coming up.
Sorry, no whipped cream
Sorry, but happy hour doesn't start until five.
'Yea...I heard that song, "Send In The Clowns", but ya still gotta pay.
So, this is your fallback career? I got bad news for you...
Lighten up! Maybe there's life after the elephants.
My seltzers are for drinking, not spraying.
"We're not hiring right now, and I think the market for clowns is already saturated".
Ringling Brothers closed? Too bad! Maybe you could segue into politics. America loves scary clowns!
This is a hold-up.....I'm not clowning around.
beers of a clown
Sorry - we're not a cartoon bar
I have the right to refuse service to anyone. Sorry to be a soda jerk about it.
We can't have outside seltzer in here.
I'm afraid the seltzer shortage has hit us all hard, Chuckles.
Who you calling a soda jerk, "Bozo?"
Heck, even the elephants got a pension.
Sorry, I can't give free drinks to every clown named Sam who comes in here
No matter which flavor you pick, he'll still be president.
I need a double Sam, the circus is dead.
Let me guess - party of 20 and you're the designated driver?
I think it's a simple matter of supply and demand, and it's so hard to compete with the White House these days! Can I cheer you up with a nice club soda down your pants?
Only on the condition you won't spray me with it.
Don't give me that sad face!
I saw in some weekly mag that you were featured in Talk of the Clown.
Yes, sir, we have seltzer water, but I’m afraid I’ll have to serve it to you in a glass.
It's complimentary if you can truly scare me.
I saw what you did with that seltzer last time.
Sorry, I think you're looking for "Ham's"
No, we don't serve big bottles of seltzer
A '3 Ring Circus' is just an expression I use for the lunch hour. We're not hiring just now.
I'm sorry, we just hired the elephant trainer.
The way I see it, life's just a circus.
Another cabinet nominee looking for a handout!
First the circus closes then you tell me you're an English major? Wow! Drinks are on the house, buddy.
Sorry pal, I'm cutting you off the seltzer.
Joke's on you buddy, we're closed.
No dice. Not till you pay for the damage you guys did last time when you tried to fit 15 into one restroom stall.
Exactly! Happy hour should be one single hour, if that.
We'll have clown hour after Trump is sworn in. Not before.
So, now that you've walked into the bar, am I gonna' be the first to hear the punch line?
So you're the guy everyone wants too have a beer with
Sorry, Sam's Big Tap is closing too.
Drink, clown, drink.
Tell them there were 250,000.
Sorry, but we're out of seltzer.
The Greatest Show on Earth couldn’t compete with Trump?
No - only American beers. Or vodka
Yeah genius, I'm Sam...you must be Bozo.
You voted for Trump?
Sometimes I think you're only here for the free peanuts.
Moving our political discussions off Twitter really has helped me to better understand your perspective.
Another seltzer water in the face?
It is you, Ghost of Happy Hour Future, that I fear the most.
When I was asked to take over the family business, I said I don't know those are awfully big shoes to fill.
You tell one more woman that it's true what they say about men with big feet and you're barred!
No, I cannot hire the elephants too.
I guess we all have an upside smile now.
That's too bad about your Ringling Bros gig. Maybe you should look up Stephen King.
Happy Inauguration[
I can tell you need something stronger than seltzer today.
Maybe they weren't laughing at you, but rather laughing *with* you.
Turn your frown upside down. It's Happy Hour.
You going to go back to College?
I'm sorry, we don't have a little clowns room.
Yeah, I hear ya, the employment office is two blocks north of here.
alright Pagliacci lets hear your story.
Sorry, no funny business.
My dad lost his job to a guy who looked just like you.
Buddy, this is a neighborhood bar. No reason to get dressed up.
Hey Bob! Nice to see you again. The Ringling party's in back. By the way, what's with the elephant in the room?
It's because you come in here funny but you leave scary.
Go 6 blocks north on Sixth Ave, take a right on 56th. When you get to Fifth Ave, it's right across the street.
Now that America is great again, the elephants are running the circus, and I hear there are opportunities for clowns at the White House.
Stop clowning around and order something!
Sorry about Ringling Bros.
There's no more beer to cry in. We just served it to a trapeze guy and three elephants.
How's politics?
I'm sorry, Washington, DC only allows me to serve one clown a day.
OK sir, no funny business. What will you have?
Could you pretend to be happy ?
Sorry to hear about your collision. I heard that it was quite an undertaking to locate to an ambulance small enough to hold all sixteen of you.
This ain't a place for no funny business sir.
Tell ya what, buddy. Forget the tip and gimme a punch line instead.
I feel like such a clown! Did anyone by chance turn in a pair of size 27 floppy red shoes last night?
"Happy Hour" does not start at 11 am on Tuesday , pal. Trust me.
Hi pop! Don't you recognize me?
Well I guess this is it. I knew one of you clowns would eventually find me no matter how hard the Feds hid me.
You don't have to be a clown to be a barista, but it helps!
Sorry pal, I only got an opening for a trick poodle.
I'll have the usual: three onion rings and a shot of Bailey's.
Happy hour does not include cotton candy.
One whole whipped cream pie to the face? I think we can accommodate you.
No, the beer doesn't taste funny.
there's always politics to consider
Cheer up.
I need to see a photo ID with your birth date.
Very funny, Donald.
What's got you down, hurt your funny bone?
Nothing personal, I have to card everyone.
Which do you prefer, 'Be a Clown' or 'Make 'em Laugh?
You know, Mom was right about you, Sam; all you do is clown around.
I already heard that one.
Sorry, no pets. That includes balloon animals.
I'd call a cab. Cluber has a 20-clown minimum.
It's just not funny any more.
I don't think she meant it literally
That's the fifth clown today,what happen did Barnum and Baily close down?
You're right. We just started the dress code very recently.
Nah, you're not the only clown in town - you were misinformed!
Knock it off Bozo, unless you want a lip to go with that nose...
All of a sudden we're getting a ton of applicants who claim they can manage a three ringed circus?
Free? Why? Has Ringling Brothers gone out of business?
I will get you a car.
Make that a root beer for me and 23 beers for those clowns in the car.
Sorry, Grumpy Hour has just ended ten minutes ago.
No outside food or seltzer is allowed.
No joking, we are out of bitters.
Stop clowning around or I'll have to cut you off!
Sorry Chuckles, we're all out of helium.
I'm sorry, your nose looks too red, I can't serve you.
No. I don't think it's time for clowns to be exempt from showing their photo ID.
We have no carry out Seltzer Bottles.
Plantar Fasciitis. Obamacare repeal. Seltzer. Face. Now.
Crazy hair is really hot right now.
It's Inauguration day,we are out of laughs
It's all because of the elephants in the room.
Where should we start?
No worries--today's lunch special won't make you smile.
Another seltzer?
Seltzer as a metaphor for unexpected tragedy? I can see that.
The sign clearly says no shirt, no big red shoes, no service.
I'm sorry, Ollie. You just weren't enhancing happy hour.
They laughed when you said you were leaving to join the circus......they're not laughing now!
That balloon disaster sounds like a close shave.
You probably have time for a quick one before the SWAT team gets here.
Sorry, dad, I thought you knew - I wasn't just clowning around.
Sorry, all of our cream pies are gone
Just a seltzer water, please.
Sorry, I just hired an elephant to wash dishes.
Tryouts for the Trump's court jester is 2 doors down on the right.
Do you know how many times I've heard that?
Well, you could run away and join the forest.
Have you thought about auditioning for the Executive, Legislative and Judicial Three-ring Circus?
I'll trade you a free pass to the 2018 Ringling Bros. Circus for a beer.
Sorry. In 2 hours it's a circus in here.
You look fine. Remember, it's just a cartoon.
Not only are we closed, but clown time is over.
You know, we paid you for the full Happy Hour.
Nice try Sam, but if your trying to spy on my work habits you should try a better secret shopper costume.
I don't know why you would need that much seltzer water, but if you insist.
Sometime's you just need to let it out.
I have been waiting to cash in on that Judy Collin's song.
Sorry, buddy. No photo ID, no beer.
No, I'm not interested in having an UN-happy hour.
No more Happy Hours. You can thank your colleagues in the Mini Cooper.
"Health and Human Services. Why do you ssk'l
Is this a joke?
You look familiar. Have I seen you somewhere?
No, by golly, I DON'T know what the duck said when he walked into a bar and sat down next to a couple of incompetent chiropractors.
The trucker called; he’s running late. And the rabbi’s wife won’t let him come.
I respect you asking, but I cannot consent to you marrying my daughter.
In the wake of the eminent inauguration of Donald Trump, Giggles the Clown takes to his beloved pub to dampen the blow of a lifelong passion swallowed by a corporate competitor.
There might be something in 2020.
Yeah, I know... a little song, a little dance...
I can give you something that'll put a smile on your face
Sam, have you been watching 'Undercover Boss' again?
And do you own your own car?
The difference is when I bounce someone I don't use a trampoline.
Straight, dry, and no seltzer! Are you really a clown?
Sorry, we don't take balloons here.
No, I don't think there's one called Ringling Sisters.
I blame the Russians
No. Mr.Fellini hasn't been in here since maybe "73."
I should leave the bottle of seltzer, right?
Just a hunch, Mr President.
You had a good run, Mr. Ringling. What'll it be?
What can I get for you today, President Trump?
Uncle Sam's: Now Hiring Clowns
Sorry I can only squeeze 30 flavors in a cone.
I hate to tell you this, but happy hour ended an hour ago.
Pour is again, Sam.
Sorry, bub. I'm lookin for a bouncer, not a juggler
Yes, I heard the one about the man who walked into the white house looking like that.
I believe your elephant is double parked!
Yeah, that's not a balloon dispenser.
I'm so sorry, I heard about Ringling Bros.
Sorry, that was the last of my Seltzer.
This is no joke...a clown walks into a bar...
There's always the rodeo circuit.
Sorry to say, your running tab has been canceled by the two Ringling brothers.
Yes exactly, I mean you're funny like a clown.
No... I can't trade a beer for a balloon animal.
I'll have to cut you off; you're becoming too maudlin.
Sorry, Happy Hour isn’t until 5:00.
Now you just look sad and creepy...
As long as your money's green.
First the elephants got the boot, now you clowns. Wish I had a nickle for every time I heard that.
Get lost, clown, this is a Hillary bar.
And thats the reason I wouldn't perform at the inauguration. What was your excuse?
One gin and seltzer, hold the seltzer, coming right up.
"No, we don't have elephants either".
The sign on the door clearly states that we don't serve Trump impersonators.
I'm sorry, sir. Seltzer isn't sold in those types of bottles anymore.
"Sorry we don't accept play money".
Sorry, pal--we're out of funny business.
Children's birthday party, fetish or horror?
Sorry, the RNC already has a mascot.
We dont serve clowns. They taste funny.
What can I do to make that sad clown a glad clown?
Opera, Schmopera, you're a clown and you're out.
'Sorry,Happy Hour was two hours ago."
Listen clown, water the flower then beat it
We're obliged to serve all customers, including Republicans. What's yours?
It's 'Bring in the clowns'--plural! Sorry.
I know the circus has closed, but were just not hiring.
I'm sorry, you have to be happy inside, too, to get discounts during Happy Hour.
Ok, that's two eggs funny side up with a side of giggles?
You're using a lot of selzer and I'm not buying that its for medicinal purposes anymore.
I am definitely not interested in your punch recipe.
I'm afraid at Sam's, Happy Hour is not all day every day.
Sorry. We don't serve liberals.
First it was the Killer Clown thing, then Ringling Brothers. I bet you are just waiting for the other clown shoe to drop.
Sorry, we don't serve presidents here.
I kid you not, Stephen Sondheim is dead.
I'm not good at reading lips
Hey Sam, there's some bozo outside looking for you.
Seltzer? Yes, you're right, I should have figured it out.
I think I'm a funny guy without wearing a costume.
Ok, I admit it! You were right about a Trump presidency. Happy now? (Sorry, late submission for contest #553 but I had to do it )
Sorry buddy, everyone working here is already a clown
Well, you look like a jerk.
I'm afraid that your bar tab is positively pachydermous.
I'm sorry you don't like the house jacket but it's a requirement here.
No, those pumps can't blow up balloons.
Sorry, I don't know the way to the White House either.
After "The Greatest Show on Earth," what's next?
For the last time, no clowning around in here.
Quit clowning around and order already!
Stop clowning around and order something!
I'm not clowning around...He took the oath.
No, face paint is not an acceptable ID!
Where's your body guards?
Don't come right after work anymore. You're scaring away my customers.
Sorry, but we expect our employees to give service with a smile.
Listen here, Bozo, I'm throwing you and your sized 16 shoes out of here.
I'm looking in the mirror, and I don't like what I see.
So, do you still think it's the Greatest Show On Earth?
My friends are parking the beetle.
There's always the Inauguration gig.
Hey, it's the inauguration, man. You gotta perform.
There might be a position on our board of directors. Do you know to how to tweet?
We don't serve your kind here.
Pale ale, wheat or bubble gum?
Sorry, buddy, but we can't ignore the elephant in the tent
No - I'm afraid we don't serve jokes here.
Stop clowning around and give me your order!
Listen Ronald for the last time you can't have it your way!
People never get a sense of the real me when I'm campaigning.
"You heard me. A beer for me and water my daisy!:
Just honey roasted. No circus.
No Mr. Trump... Your not fooling anyone...
Stout, bitter or both?
Post Ringling Brothers Circus Stress Syndrome.
You're not foolin' anyone, Sam.
My wife keeps telling me I should retire, but I say, 'Honey, it's all about the stimulating people I meet every day!'
No kidding. It was Trump.
The biggest clown won?
I do not like green eggs and ham, I do not like them Sam-I-am!
Well, maybe after the inauguration more clown jobs will become available.
After 100 years, 'least I can do is buy you a drink.
Some say it's clownist, but I prefer to see the face of my customers.
Is this a setup?
You'll find something else, buddy. I think the Bigly Top Circus still has some open positions...
Palindromes are not funny.
It's clowns like you, Sam, who give this bar a bad name.
What can I get you Mr. Trump?
Sorry about the laid offs at Barnum & Bailey, but kids find you guys to too scary to work here. Have you tried applying at the White House?
Joe's has four choices.
Amazon is hiring
Sorry that you were let go when the circus moved to Washington and hired a lot of other clowns.
I'm more of a creepy clown kind of guy myself.
Sorry buddy, not any clown can do this job.
So, you switched from the Ringling Brothers insurance to Obamacare.
The Mime IPA is probably too bitter for you.
By the order of the new administration we don't sell anything to colored people who love flowers.
Huh, some big guy with a trunk was in here yesterday and had the same sob story.
Why so sad Emmett, theirs plenty of opportunity with the new administration.
That's right, you'll get a discount for providing your own soda water.
Don't worry. Trump would not recognize you as a CNN reporter.
Why would you think you were scaring the other customers away?
Yeah, they let the elephants go, but I'm confident your job is secure!
How about politics?
I'm sorry we don't serve chief executives.
I know people say it's a circus in here every evening, but it's not what you were thinking.
I've heard that "Down on my luck, need seltzer water" story too many times, bozo.
Happy hour just doesn't work the same for everyone.
What can I get for you, Mr. Trump?
You're wrecking the 'Nighthawks' painting motif we have going here.
Nuts?
Just one word: Rebranding!
The dismal state of the nation became very clear when even bartenders or clowns could no longer brighten people's lives.
My advice to you is, now the Circus has closed for good, just open a Twitter account!
You'll have to park that car outside.
You look like you could use a double.
Believe me Sprinkles there is a life after Barnum & Bailey.
Yeah, that's why I'm working the day after the inauguration too.
I'll still vote for him again.
I'm sorry, but I can't make a jellybean omelet.
I'm the first child they don't talk about.
Two fingers? And one in your eye?
Sorry pal, suddenly the market is flooded with clowns like you.
We're all out of spritzer.
I said send in the clones, not clowns!
Too late. My nephews put you in the White House.
Ah, no....we didn't name 'Happy Hour' after you.
Yeah, but cheer up; perfect job for you down the street -- they're looking for a chief of protocol.
I'm cutting you off of chocolate cream pies, you got a problem.
No, no one has ever said 'Pour it again, Sam' in here.
What do you mean, "This beer tastes funny?"
No seltzer for you!
I'm post-op too.
Water, huh? I didn't know clown cars had designated drivers.
Sorry, we frown on clowns.
Sorry, all out of circus peanuts.
Green eggs and ham, please.
Did the circus run away and unjoin you?
I'm afraid we only have club soda.
I'll give you a double. You've been repealed and replaced.
You just missed the elephants.
Sorry, that's happening around the corner on the Capitol steps.
Smas Backwards Deli... reverse in order your give please.
You want a spritzer or a fuzzy navel?
Boof knew it was time to retire when he ordered a Ringling instead of Yuengling.
Let's see your happy hour look.
Will that be straight up or with an unexpected blast of bow tie seltzer?
"Wanna hear something funny?".................
Bummer about B&B. Have you checked out a cabinet position?
You have to promise me there will be no beer squirting from the bow tie or flower.
Happy Hour's over!
Could I see your green card, please?
You come here often?
We don't serve clowns.
Sorry, no exceptions to the 'no clowns and hats' rule
We don't serve your kind here.
I can't believe your boss thinks you're clowning around at work!
Ok, so stop me if you've heard this one...
I assume you are one of the Congressmen boycotting the Presidential inauguration.
A free beer if you can make me laugh.
Sorry, Happy Hour is at the bar down the street
The opportunities here are better for "Bar"num & Bailey than for"Ring"ling Bros people.
Hey Sam, I think your old stalker girlfriend has a new disguise
So a clown goes into a bar...Want me to say it again?
Cash only - the Barnum and Bailey credit card is rejected.
The only balloon animals I want are barflies.
Been seeing a lot of you guys since Ringling Brothers announced they were closing.
17 sodas for the road, please.
Don't look so glum - the tv's not showing the inauguration. That's the Nuremberg Rally.
Sorry, we don't have any beer that tastes funny.
I'm just tired of figuring out what silent clowns want?
Whoopsie daisy
When Can You Start?
Maybe you can get a job with Trump?
No, we do not have seltzer bottle service.
I don't care that you have big feet
Yes, I remember you from college. No, I'm not giving you a discount.
Sorry buster, we'll serve the deplorable, but the irredeemable are not welcome at Sam's.
Are you sure they said "Clown-Based Workforce Management?"
Let's turn that frown upside down.
If you're asking me to play it again, you're a clown!
Frozen with Fear, Sam Soils Himself for a second time
I'm sorry, but you have to have at least a shoe size of 21 before I can serve you.
I hope you know that drinking and clowning don't mix.
So what's next for you?
Can I borrow just one handkerchief?
Fresh out of spare banana peels today
I didn't know they clowned people.
We just found in the past that letting customers use their own seltzer bottles led to misunderstandings.
Cash only ; I know the circus closed.
I think it's time to cut you off, Sparky. And I'll need you to hand over your shoes.
Sorry we had to let you go. You were scaring the customers.
Trump needs a driver for the car carrying all his cabinet members.
So, the Ringling Brothers laid you off, eh?
Okay, a double seltzer. But no more spraying patrons.
I saw how you were in the campaign, Mr. President; I think you'd benefit from a real drink for once.
You don't look all that creepy to me.
A glass of bitter laughter?
If you're really Donald Trump, prove it.
It was always packed in here before you had to go and buy your own car.
Get lost pal - it's not a Barnum & Bailey world anymore!
Quit trumping around
No No, you're hired. I Want the funny business...
We don't serve smiles.
You're early: happy hour doesn't start until 5.
Sorry about your Volkswagen.
What'll it be, Pagliacci?
Yeah, I heard about the circus folding. You ever wait tables?
We don't take kindly to your type! Go terrorize someone else!
Beer? But aren't you the designated driver for the thirty-two clowns in the back room?
Nope..we dont sell seltzer.
Sorry buddy, Orange hair doesn't entitle you to a free drink.
Funny. I was just thinking 'where are the clowns'" "Funny, I was just thinking, where are the clowns?
Now you're just being a jerk.
we're actually out of the clownfish, but I've heard that our salmon is pretty wild.
I am Sam. Sam-I-am." "I am sad. Sad-I-am.
Donald, we've told you before that we won't serve clowns here.
Happy hour was cancelled in favour of something a little less pretentious.
Pour it again you say?
Sorry, Chuckles, I can't keep giving away all my seltzer.
You just missed her. Big Bird was here a minute ago.
I guess I'm part of endangered species now.
Hey clown, who you callin' a jerk?
So this clown comes into a bar and says, 'Bartender, make it a Short Trip to Hell,' whereupon the bartender reaches under the counter and ....
Sorry. No Don Equis until Washington gets the trade stuff figured out. How about a Bud?
You say they all laughed at you when you fell-that's tough
Now that you people have the white house you think your shit doesn't stink?
Drinks for everyone...the rest of the new Cabinet is on the way...
You could run for President?
Just a water, thanks
Haven't seen the elephants, sorry.
How are things at City Hall?
Yeah, what does "S'MAS" mean?
As a matter of fact, we do have Jolson on tap.
And how would you like that seltzer?
No tears. Ok?
Ringling Brothers closed? Well, I'd suggest you check with the rodeo. Is it your first?
I've never even heard of "Bathos Hour."
So this clown walks into a soda bar...
What'll you have President Trump?
I just hope this means Ringling Bros. is in town.
Maybe you can find something with the rodeo.
They've been stalking the streets with selzer bottles ever since the Ringling Brothers layoffs.
P.S. 54, right?
Mr. President, are you sure? I thought you were a teetotaler!
My hair never grew back once I got out of the clown business.
Mom, I'm sorry but this is my dream, not yours.
How many drinks did you have before you took your driver's license picture?
The twelve guys you're looking for were here awhile ago, but they just ordered a microbrew and left in a minivan.
Things just haven't been the same since the ringmaster moved to DC for a new job.
you're kidding...
Sam decided that the two way mirror was just too depressing.
I’m just juggling too many things. And I’m too busy.
You need to get serious now...
whats it going to take to wipe that smerk off your face
Sorry, Mac. The New Yorker gig was last Thursday. The priest and the rabbi cursed you to their respective hells.
Sorry, you're the third clown to apply after Ringling Bros.' announcement.
Listen, if you want to be my cook, you can't be clownin' around on the job.
Sorry Bobo, but with the circus folding no-more-tab!
No bottle, no seltzer.
Who's this clown?
We don't serve seltzer in bottles anymore.
Yes, I'd agree you're the Greatest Schmo on Earth.
Stop clowning around. What'll you have?
How about a rum-and-joke?
Look, I'm just a soda-jerk, but in my opinion, it's an improvement from the comb-over. You know, you really have to stop clowning around. No one's laughing any more.
Sorry, I don't have any seltzer bottles to go.
Something tells me it's going to be one of those days.
The more you drink the less you're funny.
Sorry.There is no "till I get another job" drink.
You look more like a cartoon that a comic.
I know how it feels. No one showed up for our circus themed party either.
We sell seltzer in a glass but not in your pants.
Sorry, we don't serve seltzer in spritz bottles!
I'm sorry; we don't serve bozos here.
As I told the gut before you. We don't do stand up comedy here any more. That's all done in Washington now.
Sorry, I don't understand "Horn".
All clowning aside I've hired my last clown
There will be no Selzer served before it's time.
Let me get his straight. You want 17 seltzer bottles for take out?
I am Sam, Sam I am!
I really am sorry about the circus thing, but we aren't hiring at this time.
It's happy hour. You're too literal minded.
I know what you mean, Slappy. Cryin' on the inside.
If the elephant comes back in, I'll give you a call.
So I said to him, go to hell.
No im not alone, my work buddies are getting out of the car.
I bought this place from Ron years ago. He moved on to burgers or something.
It's not you.
I hear you've been cancelled in favor of The Trump Show.
No, I don't serve cream pies! What kind of an establishment do you think I'm running here? Next thing you'll be asking for banana peels. Sheesh.
I take it you're the designated driver this time?
This town's not big enough for the two of you.
It's happy hour. Would you like an amuse-bouche?
I think this would be funnier if we switched sides...
Well, another day, another Happy Hour!
You just missed Krusty. He was on his way to perform at the inauguration
Certainly, if you can make me laugh you get a one drink.
Where's my seltzer?
Sorry pal, 'Funny Hour' doesn't start until 5:00.
Love's not around.
I'm sorry but no...the hat does not make you Clooney-esque.
I'm letting you go because you can't top the guy in the White House.
Our other customers think you are kinda scary.
I do have to get out of Washington. That's all there is to it.
You're supposed to be bringing customers in, not scaring them away!
Stop clowning around and give me your order!
Don't worry about losing your job. All of life's a circus.
Sam don't serve clowns like you.
I'd better call a cab for you and the other twelve.
Whadya mean 'do we got any selzter'? What are ya - some kinda clown?!?
I heard the circus is closing; how about one on the house?
Hey, Sam! This guy look's just like the one in the lost-and-clown poster!
You tend bar Friday nights. I want you to wear that same outfit.
Disinvited to the inauguration, and unemployed?
Quit clowning around and order already!
Sorry, we're not hiring right now. Why don't you try Ringling, down the stree...oh.
I'm sorry, but we're completely out of bananas.
No one in this town has had cream pie since NAFTA. Sad!
I don't know what to do Al, the kids made fun of me again.
How did you get past the wall?
I'm not sure I know how to make a confetti chaser...
You scared away the rest of my customers
I'm sorry Seltzer is no longer free.
Well, I told you not to fuck those elephants.
Look, I told ya once already, she don't come in here no more.
I am sorry but your circus experience does not qualify you for the position of soda jerk.
How many designated drivers do you have in that tiny car outside?
Do you really want a drink or are you just clowning around?
...Clown Shoe has some good accents...Red Nose Porter is a little too dark...I recommend the Polka-Dot lager.
oh no not another bozo
Donald, stop clowning around! Are you going to order a malatov cocktail?
So the circus left town without you.....
So how was the job interview at GQ?
No, sorry. Sam died a couple years back. No joke.
Don't tell me... green eggs and ham?
Cheer up.
Your usual?
Sorry, I really don't know your name.
Ok. Ok. I'll say it. You're a very funny guy. Really, you're a scream. A really, really fun guy. Seriously.
Sorry, we don't serve clowns like you.
Perhaps you would fit in after midnight when this bar turns into a 3-ring circus.
Sorry Bozo, we're all out of elephant burgers.
Happy hour is at my discretion sir,not you.
So, did you miss the clown car to the Presidential Inauguration?
Ain't that funny. Ain't that queer. The circus closing down this late in your career.
No, I will not put something funny in your drink !
We don't like your kind here.
Yeah, since the circus shut down, we've had a lot of clowns in here looking for work.
Would you like our happy drink?
You don't have to go to the White House, but you can't stay here.
Sorry, we're out of bitters.
I'm sorry but we don't use seltzer bottles anymore, but I could use that little car that holds 20 people for my side job as a uber driver.
Sorry about Ringling Brothers. Have you tried Motor Vehicle?
I need fourteen sodas, to go.
We have a strict balloon ban.
No, I will not hand you another soda water bottle. How many times do I have to say this?
No, the seltzer water isn't free.
I'm sorry but we have no gender-appropriate bathroom for clowns!
Look, I'm sorry the Circus is closing down, but you're the third clown in here today trying to trade tickets for a drink!
So, what'll it be, Chuckles? More seltzer down the pants?
Running away and joining the circus, yeh , I kinda see it.
To become Sam's new clown, you have some pretty big shoes to fill.
The next one is on you.
Sam died a few years ago. As a tribute, we took one car to the funeral.
Who would have thunk Boffo the clown would be the biggest name at the inauguration?
Would you like a double, Mr. Ringling?
No I would remember you if you were here last night. Especially since you say you didn't change your clothes
Are you the new Norm? And how come everyone knows your name?
Losing my timing this late in my career. We needed you last night.
I believe your punchline will require one more clown and a bearded lady.
Oh yeah? Alec Baldwin's already been in today.
You don't need a drink, you need a shrink!
Once the elephants left it was over.
In keeping with preventative medicine trends, we now call it, "Despondency Deterrent Time".
Hey, I liked it, you liked it, but we are under new management and we no longer serve Pale Affordable Care Ale.
Well Otto, with the circus closing, you'll have to settle your bar tab.
Mind if I squeak your nose?
Stay calm - they can sense amusement.
"Where's the priest and the politician"?
Cheer up. Another circus will come along.
Last night was a circus today not so much.
Café au lait and a Happy Meal coming up!
The Society for Addicted Madcap Simpletons meets downstairs.
I think someone could use a "Funky Monkey."
Oh gosh. Now it's ClownCon?
Well...OK, Chuckles. I loved Ringling Bros---one double-dip Jack Daniel's banana split coming up.
So which political office are you running for this time?
Sorry Sir, but no. I hear the Re?ublican Party is hiring.
We could change the M to a D if you like
Circus is closing? I'd better order some more seltzer water.
Geez, Binky, on behalf of a grateful nation thank you for your service. This one's on the house.
If I had a dime for every clown that came in here and told me that I'd be dining with the Rockefellers. Now show me some ID or I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Sorry to hear about Ringling Brothers, have one on me.
Hey, a lot of people are having second thoughts after voting for Trump.
No, you cannot put up your clown college recruitment poster, but you can drink to forget who and what you are.
I've seen a lot of you guys since Ringling Bros. closed.
Let me guess,,, you use to be in the circus ?
You don't look creepy, but our policy is no laughing matter.
I'll give you a beer if you promise not to spray it back.
Come on man! Stop clowning around!
Your banana cream pie is ready, but remember, no funny business this time.
Is that your shoe kicking my shin?
Don't tell me, let me guess: "a guy walks into a bar and says..."
So you felt you just didn't fit in?
First the elephants and now the circus. Let's see what Trump can pull out of his "Let's Make America Great Again" hat now.
Why the long face ?
Yeah, you ought to up your game the next four years.
May I suggest a Yuengling Brother Barnum & Baileys? We serve it until your tent folds.
Twenty percent gratuity added to parties of one.
You parked your elephant in a "handicapped only" space!
I'm sorry, but I haven't seen your pink elephants.
Not funny.
I said no to the Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives clown, too.
Okay, so your total is a juggling act and one balloon animal.
Where is your motorcade?
Bartender phobia. That's a new one.
Look, Senator Schumer, he also called Meryl Streep overrated, but that doesn't make it so.
Well there's always bartending school now that the circus is closed for good.
I'm selling seltzer in a glass, not in your pants.
It hasn't been the same since we went seltzer-only.
I myself never really cared much for the elephants.
I'm sorry but you can't have a refill for your flower.
Don't look at me like that, Bozo. I don't pick these boring cartoons each week.
ID please.
Spray me another one.
No, Kevin, I am NOT ready to forgive you for getting me a vacuum for Christmas.
Our seltzer sales have fizzed out.
Sorry, pal. Come back in 2020.
Look, Bub, I was Sam the petit bourgeois restaurateur before you were Sammy the clown.
Sorry, the last clown in here sprayed out all the seltzer.
I can do the "usual" but we're outa balloons.
Sorry, we only hire people with master's degree from clown college.
Are you a jerk as well
Attention. ..Cabinet member at the door.
Pick-me-up?
Your friends definitely weren't in here tonight. I think I would have noticed 23 clowns climbing out of a Volkswagen Beetle.
Let me see...what drink do I recommend to a guy who thought he was the 'Greatest Show on Earth' for the last 150 years and just found out he now longer is? ...It's actually the same thing I recommend to every middle aged guy...a large beer
We used to get tons of your kind, but now they all go to the woods.
The new owner plans to call it the 'Trump Bros. and Trump & Trump Circus.'
I'm Kathy's clown. She said you were good for a handout.
What could you possibly be doing with all this seltzer?
No seltzer. Just Beer.
We rarely give free lunches, but if it's just you and the people in that Volkswagen...
Sometimes they throw pies back in my face too.
Take your first right, then another right, go 6 blocks, then another right. Look for the concrete Jersey barriers at the entrance. Can't miss it.
I'll play it again if you stop clowning around!
Quit clowning around. Chocolate or vanilla.
Nice try. But I won't trade a beer for a Ringling Bros. ticket.
Funny, but you don't strike me as the "vodka type".
Let's turn that frown upside down with a cup of coffee!
Here a clown, there a clown, everywhere a Clown.
We do not accept funny money as payment.
A seltzer bottle and a beer chaser, coming up.
I've been seeing a lot more of you guys since Ringling closed.
Well, I suppose we could use a juggling bartender to liven up Ladies' Night.
I know: First they laugh, then they scream. Clown called Donald told me.
Why so sad buddy? Oh, you're from Ringling Bros.
We here at Sam's provide you with a choice of 3 different seltzers that we spray directly in your face.
So who sent you in? Well maybe next year.
... which pretty much guaranteed that my trapeze career was over.
Sorry your shoes won't fit on the foot rail. How about one on the house to cheer you up.
Clown School harder than Bartender School? No way.
All 20 of your friends are on the wagon.
I'm sorry, Happy Hour isn't until 5PM
You know, you'd get cheerier service if you'd turn that frown into a smile.
We reserve the right to refuse circus to anyone.
I bake 'em, you throw 'em. Deal?
And they said it was the Greatest Show on Earth!
For the last time, no Tooty Fruity on tap.
You'll get my seltzer bottle over my cold dead hands.
Yes, I could sell you a seltzer bottle and a cream pie, but then I'd have a moral obligation to kill you.
Sorry, we don't hire clowns - too many seltzer accidents.
I've got no cash but I can make a mean balloon animal
OK already, stop clowning around and tell me what you want!
Sorr buddy, the only clown cocktail we have is the "White House Special.'
I warned him that if he said "Send the clowns gin" one more time...
``Let me guess. You're not waiting for anyone.''
My entire business plan hinged on the song's title using the plural.
They only have 'Clown Shoes' on tap in DC.
Sorry, you're closed.
i've heard this one before
I'm in response to your request to "Send in theClowns!
Heading to vote today?
One more time with "Sam I am" and your out Bozo.
Look, Bozo, quit clownin' around and order something!
What did the elephants get to keep?
I hear Russia is hiring.
Then the bartender says "Why the long face?". Get it? Horse? Long face?
'You want a squirt of seltzer with that scotch?
Sorry. We're out of barbecue rubber chicken.
We don't have any seltzer bottles.
No, gray skies are NOT going to clear up. You can take that off.
I'm not sure a bunch of clowns piling out of a bar would be as amusing.
You tell Sam that he still owes us the 300 but this time we're not joking around.
Tutti-Frutti?
Sorry, we're all out of shaving cream pies.
No bicycles - or tricycles. That's the rule.
No tears of a clown around here.
Just because it's not Happy Hour doesn't mean you have to ACT like it's not Happy Hour.
The clock reads 5:02, so I'm afraid you just missed it.
That car of yours fit a designated driver?
How about a White Russian for that 'hacking' cough,clown face?
Quit clowning around and order.
Only if you promise to stop dunking funnel cake in your beer.
Stop me if you've heard this one: 'A minister, a priest, a rabbi and a clown walk into a bar......'
Where's the Rabbi?
Did you say, Shirley Temple?
Sorry Weepy, you know the rules. It's happy hour.
Happy Hour is 4-6.
Clever costume, but I know it's you Jim.
I hear ya. Sam ditched our elephants a couple weeks after we opened.
Give me a virgin beer in a to go cup, I have to get back to the Oval Office.
Sorry, but you got the wrong Happy Hour.
Happy Hour is over clown!
Sorry, happy hour was over at six.
So...is it a perm?
Shouldn't there be three of you?
You better have a designated driver for that clown car, pal.
Don't you think you had too much already with a red nose like that?
One elephant's too many, a hundred's not enough.
Uh, I guess juggling is a skill related to the position.
Welcome to happy hour
What would you like me to squirt into your mouth?
Let's see some ID.
It is pronounced "Smas".
No, Sam left yesterday to start his own circus.
Humor me, will ya, and just shtick with the menu.
In all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world you have to skip into mine.
Surprisingly, not creepy.
What do you mean your flower needs a refill?
Chin up; Last year an elephant was sitting where you are and now he is working in Washington D.C.
We canceled it.
Sorry pal. Happy Hour ended at 7.
I'm sorry sir, we only serve bottled soda.
No, this is not happy hour!
What? no more circus? This one's on me...we need to turn that clown frown upside down!
No, I won't sell you 30 gallons of seltzer water
Plain seltzer, low-carbonation seltzer, and seltzer with a spritz. For you, I'm guessing the seltzer spritz.
No free refills, seltzer or otherwise.
Listen, Chuckles. The boss doesn't think your tab is that funny.
No way! My little son had the same costume for Halloween.
Your Uber-pool is only fourteen clowns away.
I'm sorry the circus is shutting down, but there is a need for scary clowns."
You're going to have to get your sodas at the White House from now on.
Your buddies in Washington coming out for trivia night?
You have to order a beer to get the Cracker Jacks.
The clown's march was canceled.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't take "spritzer" so literally.
Sorry, we no longer serve ‘XXX’ in the wooden bottle.
No more booze, Bozo.
This time only if you drink it, not spritz it my face.
I can see why you think you're "beside the point" these days
Hey! No "outside" seltzers allowed!
I'm sorry, but as a man of science slapstick goes against my beliefs
Sorry Sir, we only have eleven cream pies left.
Norm!!! Sorry...flashback.
Sorry to rain on your parade JoJo, but "I'm not looking for anything serious" means something else, entirely.
Sorry, nothing on the menu to juggle today.
So....more of that beer that tastes funny?
I wanna see some ID.
I'm going to have to cut you off on the seltzer, bud.
I was an alcoholic clown, too, until I decided to focus on what I was best at.
You said "make it again Sam", but I'm not sure what you ordered last time.
For you, it's just "No Shoes - No Service".
Yes, I can see your a clown, but Happy Hour still doesn't start for half an hour.
Hey man read the sign, no balloon animals allowed
We don't serve your kind, here... but I found it funny, that you asked!
I guess you are on a balloon bender?
On inauguration day i just wanted to go where everybody knew my name.
Look, Buddy, no clowning around here--What'll it be?
Will a lager suffice for your squirt flower?
Sorry, I'm not licensed to refill flowers.
Oh, I've heard this one.
I'm sorry, but the other 10 customers need a designated driver.
Good afternoon, Senator Schumer. You're early. Happy Hour doesn't start for another fifteen minutes.
Spumoni. You buying or selling?
Sorry, "Mr Flappy," but you have to go to 'www.FlowerSquirtRefill.com' for that now.
Actually I do know how to make a sad clown happy. How about a beer?
None,none that"taste funny"
No, Happy Hour is not covered by Obamacare, Trumpcare or Medicare.
I don't think you should drink if your going to be driving home . The last time you drove into a tree you injured all 30 of your passengers.
Look, Sam, maybe it was a midlife crisis...but you had to give it a shot, ain't that the truth?
Well Sam, since you left to join the circus we've stopped serving clowns. Try Chuckles down the street.
I appreciate the disguise, your bar tab is twenty bucks.
Try the chocolate shrimp swirl. It definitely tastes funny.
I'm guessing Rocky Road.
Are you the character the agency sent to give the joint atmoshere?
Juggling highballs and lowballs just takes practice.
Nobody comes here anymore since we got rid of the pink elephants.
Sorry, check the Big Top Bar. We don't sell seltzer bottles to go.
No, no gray elephants around here.
Sorry to hear about that circus closing.
Your flower sags to the left, I guess you voted for Hillary.
You voted for him, so don't blame me for vodka only.
As Sam looked into the mirror, he saw only the sad face of the man he always wanted to be.
Judging by your shoes, I'm surprised you didn't order a double!
It may have been The Greatest Show on Earth, but can you turn a four top?
Look Buddy, I can't sell you seltzer to go without a Photo-ID
BOOZE-O stop clowning around.
We do give free drinks to Presidential Cabinet members, but you don't look like one.
He's mad because he is about to lose his job and the President doesn't care enough to tweet about it.
Sorry, we don't serve clowns.
Nah, career choices don't come on tap.
Hey, I'm supposed to be the jerk!
Can you quit clowning around and order already!
Sorry. No refills.
The new employee mistook "hump-day" for "Trump-day"
I'm sorry about Barnum and Bailey but I can't give you a Shirley Temple to drown your sorrows
So that's how you get out of the "Tower" Mr. Trump. Will you do the same in DC?
Need a cup of coffee before terrorizing the neighborhood porches all night?
Sorry, we're all out of the Clown IPA.....
a tough day Senator Schumer?
It's a thin disguise, Mr. President. And Barnum isn't hiring. Drink?
Quit clowning around and get back to work.
Isn't it rich, my time to swear- Me here at last in DC, with my orange hair.
So, the kids didn't think you were scary enough. Sad. Seltzer Water?
Turn that frown upside down, and I might serve you.
What do you mean they wouldn't let you stay with the rest of the circus at the White House.
I'm sorry, but clowns are really out right now.
Despite what you've heard, you do NOT need to be a clown to work here.
please, no clowning around.
Are you a clown or a hippie? We don't serve hippies here.
Yes, I heard about Ringling Brothers. Are you laughing on the inside?
Trump replaced you as head clown? He's not even funny.
Tough news about the circus, buddy.
Yeah I checked... the soda tax will apply to those seltzer water bottles you love so much.
So, what are you going to do now that Trump has left town?
Sorry, Barack, but its not about you anymore.
"Our clientele are a serious people and they don't like any funny business.
We don't get many show folk in this bar.
I was going for shabby chic. You?
Well I certainly didn't mean anything by it.... Mr. Pesci.
You know why no one is at the bar. It's because people are really afraid of clowns like you.
I'm afraid I can't accept your ID, Mr Hugsybear
I'm sorry but buffoonery has recently migrated to the Beltway.
I heard your circus gigis is up. Shall I make it a double?
Tell me Barnum, how's business?
You wouldn't believe who was just in here.
I know Ringling Brothers is going out of business, but if you want a job you'll have to think about the outfit.
Your wife already called to tell me about your new costume.
Sephora's moved.
Sorry but no, I can't let you see the soda gun today
Brighten up - circuses will be great again.
I'm sorry, sir, but I've never heard of Emmett Kelly, much less a drink by that name.
Sorry, we are out of squirting flowers.
Are you an 'American' clown?
Sorry, no opening for a short order cook... consider a presidential run.
Uncle Sam needs more than a clown, pal.
. . . and without The Wall, illegal Mexicans will get all the clown jobs.
Would you mind taking your hat off in the house?
I feel like Ringling my neck.
At least you've got custard-y.
Hey, did we install that one way mirror yet?
What is your current job?
Where do you want me to start? With the elephants?
So, who did you vote for?
Hey Bozo, I already told you we're not hiring!
Hey bud, why the long face?
Proof of age...?
Ringling Brothers closed? At least they let you keep the hat.
Sorry, Your Time Has Gone By…..
Trying to scare up a drink?
You say "apocalypse," I say "making room for greatness, again."
This is technically the drive-thru lane, but thanks for not coming all at once in the same car.
No, I haven't seen a priest, a rabbi or (in italics) a minister.
No squirting the customers bozo.
Just another Bozo.
Don't get funny with me, mister,,,
Hey, buddy! Using the cover to get out of town or into town?
Just one drink, Seriously?
Sorry, our free drinks for clowns promotion is over.
Sad news about the circus, Peppy. Let me give you a free beer and have a close look at that flower.
Yeah, I heard about Ringling Brothers, but we're not hiring.
Nothing for me. I'm just gonna grin and bear it.
Take off the gloomy mask of tragedy. It's not your style.
I don't want any trouble out of you.
Ringling Brothers? this one's on the house.
Sorry - the rubber chicken special was last week.
You will love this one " So three clowns walk into a bar...."
Stop clowning around and show me your ID.
Sorry, I've already got a balloon animal guy.
Is that really what I look like?
Where are your horse and priest?
Yes, we bottle our own seltzer water, but I'm only going to sell one glass at a time to you.
This is now the Greatest Show on Earth
Don't worry. You belong in the Cabinet and you will be.
Yeah right, Bobo - the circus went out of business...
You are not mature enough to drink.
Oh no, not another joke about a nine inch pianist.
Executive interview didn't go so well, huh?
You say you’re depressed because you don’t get why people are laughing at you?
No, the presidential car did not come by here.
I told you, no clowning around.
Sorry you didn't get enough votes to become our new Senator. You can try again in four years.
Sad to hear the circus is closing down; why don't you get a job in government?
It is easy to recognize you, Mr. President.
I'm sorry. We don't offer clown discounts.
I'm tired of serving you clowns in here!
If we hire you would you be willing to relocate?
We don't get many real clowns in here...mostly just the merely gay.
Trump says we don't have to serve clowns.
I apologize for my son. It was an honest mistake, senator. My son always wanted to be a republican.
Another Red Nosed Amber Today?
Yep, we have that flavor...but it tastes funny.
Stop clowning and get in here! You're late again!!
The manager said I can't serve you. You don't meet our dress code.
Sorry to have to tell ya, pal, but Silly died years ago.
I'm finding it difficult to take you as a serious applicant.
Sorry, we are no longer accepting applications from former circus employees.
I have just the right drink to turn that frown upside down, Mr. Clown!
Marcy says I'm not allowed to serve you dessert anymore.
Of course, the new administration views Barnum & Bailey's employees with keen interest. Bye bye big top; hello, carrot top!
Quit clowning around and tell me what flavor you want!
So sorry, pal. What, with the nose and the flower and . . . never mind. Can I get you a beer?
I was Clownin' Sam until I discovered alcohol.
I'm sorry, our Dress-up-as-Clown special isn't until tomorrow.
I think you clowns need a significant public relations campaign.
Looking in the window, the clown felt sad for the soda jerk.
The next election is four years away.
Big shoes, clown face, no service.
Detective: Describe him to me." Bartender: "Hard to say. You bozos all look the same to me."
Sorry... no. We don't carry gluten free meringue.
Sorry Chuckles - not enough business to hire a seltzer pro.
Runaway from the Circus?
Oh, bother. You're here.
No way; not after what happened to your car the last time you drank here
We don't serve clowns here.
You're no Billy Crystal, but the concert organizers are desperate by now
The priest and the rabbit couldn't make it.
No, pagliaccio non son. No Ringling Brothers. No job. Only clown left is now The President.
Why shouldn't I worry? I've been struggling with brand dilution ever since the election season, when all sorts of folks started being referred to as clowns.
I'm sorry, we don't serve Coco
Drowning your sorrows?
Until you drink responsibility, we're not serving you more seltzer water.
Sure Sam loved clowns, but he died
Interesting idea, but "clown and gown" might be a hard sell with the university folks.
Why the pear-shaped face?
Forget about the elephants!
You say you have experience watering elephants? When can you start?
OK, so the circus may be over but happy hour starts in 10 minutes!
I know the circus left town but your shoes are just too big to fill.
Don't worry there will be a lot of job openings for clowns now that Trump is Presudent!
I heard. I still don't have an opening.
You say you're out of work and do I know where they sent the elephants?
Senator Schumer - would you like the usual?
I'm sorry, but we're not hiring clowns at the moment. It's already a circus here.
Have you talked about this with the elephants?
Stop clowning around and order already.
Clown walks in to a milk bar
Hey Sma's, what happened to Sam's?
Nah, I don't have much problem with animal rights activists in my line of work.
If an old soda jerk and a clown can get along, you'd think everyone else could too.
Yes, we hsve no bananas today...
A priest, a rabbi and a CLOWN? Sorry. This is a closed caption!
Yout circus better not be moving to Mexico without the President knowing!
Bozo, I'm really sad too that you're not the top-rated scary clown anymore.
Sure-we'll serve anyone as long as they're not gay.
Trump? No I didn't vote for him. Did you?
sorry, we don't do flower refills here.
No pie for you!
What is this, some kind of three-drink circus?
How about one for the road ... in honor of the Ringling Brothers' Circus and its glorious past?
All 12 of your buddies piled into a Mini-Cooper and skedaddled so you're going to have to pay up -- and no funny business!
Sorry--we're fresh out of clown 'n' tonic.
Another humble pie?
Let me guess...extra dry martini.
Yes, it is your fault. As P.T said, "Clowns are the pegs on which the circus is hung."
I betcha women have their own definition of a party animal.
Sorry, Donald. Uncle says we don't serve sad, angry clowns!
Sorry, we're all out of cream pies, how about mincemeat?
Sorry Clyde, We don't do Happy Hour on weekends.
you're telling me IT is over between you and Stephen King?
Sorry. We no longer serve the C.L.O.W.N. community.
No foolin'. No ID, no service.
What's that you say...the hamburger tasted funny to you?
May I recommend the Down Clown Abbey?
And he calls me a jerk, really!
Nope, we don't have a Sam here. Just S'mas. Should be back in a second if you want to wait.
Ready to become a hobo clown?
Well with the circus gone, I guess the next step is hobo.
I have all the seltzer water I need, thanks.
You must pay the price of a clown.
I can understand why the tune, 'Tears of a Clown,' could be getting you down.
What is it with you clowns coming in here wanting a drink on the house?
We don't play "Send in the clowns" here.
I'm afraid we're out of whatever you need.
Sorry, I don't serve your kind here.
Pagliacci finished it's run?
I know the Ringling Circus is folding its tent forever, but the clown bar is still down the street.
Sometimes, when business was slow, the old bartender dreamed of becoming a circus clown.
Sorry, we only have CROWN Royal.
… And I understand that the zoning ordinances are very flexible in this neighborhood ….
We have eggs, bacon and pancakes, but we don't serve slapstick.
I'm sorry. I'm not that person anymore.
Tough luck, buddy, but we're not hiring.
Yes, but do you have experience keeping things in buckets?
Why the long phaze?
It's happy hour, so I'm afraid I can't take your order.
Yeah, the name is Sam. But I don't play.
Listen, pal, if you want to get sprayed in the face with seltzer, do it in your own home.
Sorry; PETA has the pink elephants as well.
How about a seltzer while you wait on your taxi?
No balloons. I can give you foam.
No, I’m sorry—we no longer allow clowns to run tabs on ice-cream birthday cakes.
Finally...someone willing to make the risible visible.
Is "scared" the new "creepy?"
Something to help turn my frown upside down.
You can have anything you want Bub, but no funny money accepted.
Well, maybe, next year.
Last call.
*Sigh* I thought we decided it wasn't a good idea for customers to see you like this Sam...
Sam's funeral was yesterday.
When you called about the job I said "clone."
What is this some joke?
So three guys walk into a bar; a priest, a rabbi, and a clown.
How is the designated driver chosen among your many peers?
There's just no job security in this day and age!
The spigots are just for show. This place is BYOB.
Yes they did send for you. But they couldn't take it anymore and moved to Canada.
Well, since the circus closed, I've been looking to get into another industry.
Stop clowning around.
Well Sam, your resume looks good where it counts.
Out of a job? Let me turn that clown frown upside down.
Yes, Uncle Sam's serves clowns...
I've got the vodka if you've got the squirt.
Would you like a celebratory, or desultory?
I don't care how you dress. I won't hire you. You're simply not a people person.
No sir, the hipster bar is across the street
It's like looking into a fucking mirror
You need to learn some self control. No more seltzer for you.
I know this chick, she digs clown cars. Buy her a seltzer!
You may want to think about a prescription anti-depressant if the booze isn't helping - just saying.
Need more beer for your flower?
Good timing - there's no one around.
No, I am not afraid of you.
Tell Mom that my experience with seltzer bottle slapstick helped me get the job.
I haven't seen the elephants since the circus left town
Wet foot or dry foot?
The usual.....Coulrophobia on the rocks?
Maybe I would have had hair if I were a clown. But then again maybe I wouldn't smile if I were a clown.
No, I'm sorry. We're not hiring.
Are you going to San Francisco?
Yesterday, you were the joker. Now, you're the clown. Frankly, I don't see the difference.
How 'bout a Sarasota Sling?
Retiring? You may be 146 years old but you still act like a child!"
Comin' from work?
Sam? I haven't heard that name in years!
I think it's time you change your act.
Sure, I'll sell you the gin, but you can't squirt it inside the bar.
Hey clown, your funny money is no good here.
Good news, Jack. This American carnage stops right here and right now.
No more credit, you're not the greatest act anymore.
Trump's in office now, so we don't serve to clowns.
Your resume is impressive, but the position requires soda 'jerk' experience.
I'm real sorry to hear about Ringling Brothers, Chuck, but you can't pay for this in gags.
Sure, I can make you a Four Year Bender. But I gotta warn you, the meat wagon already picked up another clown who ordered it.
Bozo Beer it is, Mr.... Sorry, didn't catch your name.
No, I haven't seen your 9 friends. Where did you park your Yugo?
Me?! I'd say you did it to yourself, Sam.
They rejected my nomination.
Other than working for Ringling Brothers, what experience do you have?
No clowning around in here.
No cash? Well, har de har...
If you left your wallet in your other pants, how did you plan to pay for the drink?
Trump's inauguration can make even a merry clown very down.
How much seltzer do we have?
We don't serve from flowers.
When I need a straight man, I'll advertise.
Sorry Mr. Ringling, we're not hiring.
I'm not joking, this is serious.
Nothing free, but funny you should ask
Are you havin' a laugh?
Free drinks - happy Hour? I don't think so.
Smile. It's okay to be spotted here.
Do you think I'm overdressed?
You shouldn't complain. You had so many great years, Bozo.
Out with a whimper, huh?
Can you stop clowning around and tell me your order already?
Milk on the rocks?
People say I'm the life of the party cause I post a tweet or two.
No, I don't know your name and your money better not be funny.
We don't use seltzer in our drinks anymore.
Hey, look mister, we serve hard drinks in here for men who want to get drunk fast. And we don't need any characters around to give the joint atmosphere.
clowning around.
Vanilla, Chocolate or Strawberry?
What'll it be
I will not apologize. You are a clown show.
The circus starts at 1 a.m.
You know we don't serve seltzer. Just go ahead and order a beer.
Sorry, I can't serve you. Better a sober clown than a drunken fool.
Sorry, we don't do three-ring sundaes anymore.
You said I needed a hobby
I'm sorry sir, I can only serve you 3 scoops in a bowl or a cone. No juggling allowed in here.
Strawberry limeade, neat.
I thought elephants were good luck...
It's not my fault if you ate something that tasted funny.
you fucking Son of a god damn Bitch
Never heard of the brew called "beer barrel polka". Sorry.
Ringling just closed here for my cabinet appointment hearing
Yes we have beer on tap. No clowning around.
No, Buttons, according to the most recent Quinnipiac Poll only 37% of the world loves you.
Bojangles couldn't make it in today.
I see you read the sign on the door - No clowning around.
Hey, buddy! Using the cover to get out of town or into town?
You want a stream of soda where!?
I heard about Ringling Brothers, must be a sad time to be a clown.
I remember you now. Yeah, I'll make you a banana split, but after last time no whipped cream. Period.
Sorry, we don't carry seltzer water.
A clown shooter? Are you serious?
after 146 years...sure I'm sad about leaving ringling bros. don't those peta folks know the kentucky derby celebrates its 143rd running for the roses this may? go figure!
I don't think the Trump tweet meant literally, NO MORE CLOWNING!
Sorry, the "Trumpenstein" is no longer available in the Fun Pack.
You don't know the third Clown Commandment? What are you, some kind of bozo?
No, you can't see me seltzer dispenser for a sec.
I'm drowning my humour.
There was a mime in here hating on you
Only a Bozo like you would ask for just the banana peel from the split.
A flaming banana rum what?
You look like you could use a root beer
I've told him 100 times. stop clowning around
Bill, we know it's you in the clown suit.
What'cha looking at...? You think somethings funny buddy?
"Giggles"? , No, she was waiting for "Chuckles".
Here's looking at you kid
Sundae Funday?
No, we're not hiring. Our clientele doesn't usually get the jokes.
It's pushing up daisies, Larry. That's how old that joke is.
Welcome back, Lucille. We've missed your wry sense of humor.
Ya want a freebie 'cause you graduated Clown College? Well, har har har, Bozo! Clowns think you're entitled with yer goofy duds and flowers and shit. Well, lemme tell ya, Bud, I could wipe that frown off yer face with my bar rag in a NY second.
I'm sorry but I just don't want you to become an even sadder clown.
No, I didn't notice anything peculiar.
So the clown car flat left you?
We don't go for your type of shenanigans around here.
I'm sorry Sam. But YOU were the one that made the "no clowning around" rule.
So, whose clown are you?
Do you have a designated driver? Or twenty?
Ronald: You are arrogant, self-absorbed, and the fashion consciousness to always dress for success. You should run for president!
Donald Trump,I won't let you in.
As Ben Franklin said, “Beer is proof God loves us and wants us to be happy” --so what can I get ya?
They've been wandering the streets with seltzer bottles ever since the Ringling Brothers layoffs.
The circus left town.
I'm sorry. The clowns we serve here only wear ties.
Look on the bright side - no more fighting for shotgun.
Sorry, I'm not voting for you for mayor of New York City.
Tuesdays can be a drag.
Sorry, this is a fragrance free establishment. You'll have to lose the flower.
Sorry. We are out of seltzer water refills.
It's pronounced Suhmaze.
Who you calling a jerk, clown?
The place was full before you came in.
Unfortunately I'm all out of seltzer water.
What kind of a clown drink request is that, bro?
Please don't tell me I'm in the middle of an old joke!
So you're catering for Trumps inauguration are you
I'm not joking around, we really are closed.
Yeah, we can fill those shoes for you.
Sure, we sell seltzer, but only the drinking kind, friend.
Sorry, we don't serve liberals in this establishment.
I doubt the White House will valet the clown car.
Didn't running away to the circus work out?
Look for a woman with a low IQ , and lots of courage.
Well this isn't a locker room either.
Nobody ever said life was fair.
Sorry! We only serve happy clowns.
I don't know...you could work happy hour, and then lead the other clowns out at closing time.
No Hilary, you're taking people's advice too literally.
Sorry to hear they're 'Ringling' your curtain down.
Well, joining the circus was always a terrible career choice.
That 'fake it till you make it' strategy never worked for me.
Do you want that daisy spritzer on the rocks?
But you know what's not a joke? Our happy hour prices!
yeah sure i can serve you til your nose turns white.
Ringling Bros huh?
So, are you just colorblind or what?
Sorry...Sam's is 'No Clown Zone.'
We don't need no sad clowns
Sorry, we're all out of Clown Shoes Chocolate Sombrero Stout. How about their Hoppy Feet IPA?
If I give you another shot, please don't start acting like a clown.
Is there a chance you'd be hiring?
Wanna swap?
Are you in town for the Star Wars convention?
Yeah, the other two or three dozen guys just left.
No, I said you were a second GLASS citizen
So you say this place used to be called "Uncle Sam's" and when you were a United States Marine, we wanted you?
I'm sorry, Sir, but our new manager, Mr. Trump, is serious about enforcing our "No Bozos" policy.
Any interest in starting a band?
I'm sorry. We don't serve cross dressing clowns!
You want that Pagliacci straight up?
I'm cutting you off, I'm drowning in your soda water tab.
We don't really have any "kooky kocktails" - how about a beer?
Why the long face ?
I hoped out to save the spot, the other 15 are coming.
You look kind of funny. So give us a smile, anyway!
I don't care if your name is Donald, you're not getting the job and that's that.
Of course that was with nuts.
You're struggling, we're all struggling. No more seltzer on the cuff.
Creepy Clown Happy Hour doesn't start till 5.
Look Bozo, you’re gonna have to park that clown car somewhere else.
Just heard Ringling's left town, closing down after 150 years. You wanna beer on the house?
The beer is 10 bucks a pop - that's no joke.
So you're the Fuzzy Navel?
Several reviews said you clowned around too much.
Hire a clown to wash dishes? I'm thinking you're overqualified.
Sorry Bozo, I gotta cut you off and call you a clown cab.
I'll still need to see some ID, you're behavior has been very immature!
I knew the circus couldn't last without those elephants.
Yes, there is a 10% discount for Clown Happy Hour.
Yeah...you're going to have to lose the hat, sir.
No, what I actually said was, 'We don't serve transgender CLOWNS here.'
Jeff, I told you you can't dress up like that after the clown-scare last year.
Like I said, no card, no seltzer!
Why the frown? Ringling Brothers not offering any severance pay.
"Oh, a Crown and Coke! my apologies Otto".
The job is to help our customers feel happy that we are out of beer.
And a witte for you?
Eat lambs and rams at Sam's. Top that.
I'll have a shot and a bear
Headed back to the woods on Monday?
It's "happy" hour...Not Howdy Doody time.
Sorry. We already hired a clown..and The Flying Wallendas.
We're supposed to hire American, so go get on your red, white, and blue costume, and lose the orange hair!
Well I can try...'So a clown walks into the bar and the bartender says....'
That could've been me.
The lives of your twenty-seven passengers are in your hands, drive soberly.
See you on the flip side
Are you the DD for all those drunks in the Volkswagen?
That's a new one on me, Mr. Ringling. What IS a "cyanide sling"?
Is this the happy hour ?
You say you are a singer of ballads - how's that working for you?
No seltzer, just club soda.
Gee...unfortunate timing, Ed. They've closed the circus for good.
You can't park a car in here--even an ittybitty one!
I had no idea my reflection was a sad clown.
Sorry, We stopped selling bottles of seltzer twenty years ago.
Did you hear the one about a clown walks into a bar?
Sorry, election season is over, so we're all out of coconut pies.....
Apply in two weeks when Obamacare is repealed and I can afford not to cover your risky clown ass.
How bout a Trump? You drink it and you start clowning around.
Confidentially, we get a lot of weirdos in here.
Let me guess, a Sad Clown for the sad clown?
Sorry, we don't serve psychopaths here,
Look, pal, your shtick didn't get you elected to anything.
What kind of a clown thinks you serve chocolate milk in a peanut Bar ?
Sorry, I'm gonna have to cut you off, Ronald.
Sure, I guess, but we haven't had fun in here since the 90's
So what's the good word on the street?
Tomorrow is karaoke night, I don't care what Sam told you!
I think you've had too many.
Can't say that I've ever mixed a 'Funny Man'.
I'm sorry but seltzer water is for paying customers only!
We're just looking for candidates with stationary seltzer experience.
Grab your gear, Sam...we've been sent in.
And you didn't win your re-election? You're the only one.
Sorry Sir, we don't serve clowns here.
We opened after Pagliacci's closed two years ago.
Quit clowning around Sam, I want my flower back
What's wrong with having two moms?
You get all 27 flavors with our "All You Can Eat Clown-Car Cone."
Well, I thought your presence could help get some kids in here, but looks like it's not happening.
You come here often?
Honestly, I would have never guessed that you worked as a guard at the White House.
Yes, I have beers for a clown on tap.
So, what'll you have? something plain or something funny!
Sorry, we only have a "Smas" special.
Moscow Mule specials begin January 20th ya clown.
... and I'm unsure about hiring a bartender named Punchy.
No worry. Dumbo and friends will be fine now.
Know any elephant bar jokes?
No, we don't have balloon animal swizzle sticks for our cocktails
Hey, no ID... no service, no exceptions.
Even if you make it, Sam, "Undercover Boss" is not going to get you to the presidency.
Looks like your flower could use a double black-eyed susan on the rocks.
At first glance ? You're not soda jerk material.
How much whipped cream do we have in the back?
Uncle Sam wants you!
What do you mean, honk it again Sam ?
I don't have body dysmorphia.
They are sending me to a clown sanctuary.
Are you the character the agency sent to give the joint atmoshere?
Sorry but Bozo doesn't have a drink tab here.
Pour is again, Sam.
I can see the effort, but it does not change your story, Mr President.
Bozo just left.
Sorry, Sam discontinued the "Sad Clown Saturday" special.
Sorry Bozo, but 'Happy Hour' is an hour from now.
Yeah, I saw the news about the closing of the circus.
It's just not the same, since you sold that car....
Now that's a new one. Resting Bozo face.
Sorry Chuckles, Clown Association ID's aren't valid here.
The first Sad Clowns Anonymous meeting gets off to a slow start
I need my smile back.
But this isn't Ringling Brothers. So knowing how to juggle and cramming into a car with ten of your buddies ain't gonna help with the breakfast shift.
Your dress is more appropriate for Uncle Sam's
Nope, just the basics. Three-Ring Bing would be a Ben and Jerry flavor.
I think I saw you on You Tube.
How about a Clown Car? It's like a Sidecar, but with a never-ending amount of alcohol.
I'm sorry but I can't squirt you with seltzer water.
I'm sorry Ringling Bros is closing, but we're still not hiring
Now quit clowning around!
This is the end of my career. I got an invitation to the Trump inauguration.
I'm sorry, we don't serve Coco
make it a double today was no laughing matter
Quit clownin' around. Order something or go...
It's tough times for everyone, but I still can't accept clown shoes as a form of currency.
Who're you calling a nwolc?
So, it's the same as I've told you every day you've asked; we sell sandwiches, not cream pies.
Just how many friends have you got there?
Why the hell would we serve seltzer water in spray top bottles?
Sam doesn't work here anymore.
I'm sorry Bubbles, you know I can't serve dish soap.
Funny, we don't serve your kind here.
It will cost you extra to spray it onto my face, and it STILL won't make you happy on the inside
They say there's a lot of room in the elephant train now.
.. And Sam's shtick is the amazing, draining sink.
Listen pal, use that squirting flower routine again and yer outa here.
'' You look like you just read 'My Father's Cellar'...''
Drinks on me, first one of you to Crack the glass ceiling.
I'll have a Shirley Temple. Better make it a double!
Sorry, Barnum and Bailey isn't on tap anymore.
We can't sell you a water dispenser. Or fill it with scotch.
No, that was yesterday.
One dirty martini, coming up.
I just refuse to serve you because you scare me!
Now you’re really starting to spook the regulars. Lose the daisy.
Let me guess, the swirl tasted funny?
Have you tried it without the make-up and costume? Might improve your social media profile.
No banana creme pie for you, pal. It took me forever to clean myself up after the last one!
Don't worry, I won't squirt the drink in your face.
Quit clowning around buddy, what'd have.
We have grin, jeer, and merry.
I'm not Sam Malone and this isn't Cheers so you're on your own pal.
I hear they're hiring out East.
Smiley The Clown needed a large pint of Happy Juice before his next birthday party.
First clown sighting of 2017.
Never met a clown that was terrified of a red cherry.
Funny, but Sam went to the circus.
An old pal of mine was c Clown... he died laughing
Things lightening up?
McDonald, schmackdonald. I don't care. No money, no burger!
I'm sorry but we only serve happy clowns Spiffy
What'l you not have?
Hi Sam, you want the usual?
Why don't you come in and tell me about your problem?
Sorry, I don't hire runaways, but I have the perfect suggestion for you to try next.
The 3 ring circus martini is today's special for happy hour
Used to play a horn xylophone as part of my act. But every time they introduced the "Magnifico Honky", I was either laughed or booed off stage. Yeah, it's a funny business.
Give me 25 shots in a one-shot glass.
You don't seem that insane to me. Where is your posse?
Seltzer bottle service starts at $750.
I have no idea whats going on here
So, when did you drop out of clown school?
Some clown broke in last night and made off with my whole stock of seltzer water.
Anything to get this taste of hankercheif out of my mouth.
There's somethin' funny goin' on here!
You get the keys when they pay the tab.
No, the beer here doesn't taste funny.
Your mother will be delighted that you have come back home, Garth!
Bozo, Turn your frown upside down, son the circus will be back in town.
Mr. Pruitt, That was awfully nice of the Sierra Club to buy you a new suit for your swearing in ceremony.
The kids didn't laugh this time huh? I'll get you your favorite drink right away.
Long time, no see.
Do they offer a 401k?
Bob, you might get a job if you turn your frown upside down.
Sir, I am Sam and I only make hand-crafted artisanal microbrew beers from organic hops sourced from my family-owned independent farm that runs on an energy neutral mix of solar and bio. (Pause) I can't tell if you're clowning around right now.
You want my advice? Skip the sprinkles.
Sure you don't want something a little more, hoppy?
Sorry, Sam's doesn't serve clowns like you.
Sorry, pal. We don't serve anyone with a red nose.
Donnie, you can't keep coming around here playing make believe.
I ain't fallin' for that aardvark in a clown suit gag again.
Did you remember to lock the door?
Sorry about the elephants, pal. Always enjoyed them.
Can't get the circus monkey off your back?
I'm not clowning, we've all been working for peanuts since the Ringling Brothers' elephants took over this franchise.
I know how you feel about it closing, I was an aerialist.
Kids, you never know. You're always welcome here.
We have Large malts, but not Yuge!
Sorry, the 'Clowns Behind Bars' support group meets at the jail, not here.
You look like you just saw a clown
Window shopping at the local watering hole.
Sorry, we don't serve any funny food.
I told you, Sam's not here.
The water's for drinking only.
I should think myself in your shoes?!!
Just let a smile be your umbrella.
I'm waiting for my clowncarpool to get here.
you could even say it glows
Dad, is this your first date on matematch.com?
Bozo considers career options.
There's nothing funny about it.
If you are the designated clown car driver--you had better stick to soda!
Thanks for cheering up my day.
Unlike a martini, clown acts are the same.
That's a clown question, bro.
I've got nothing to put a smile on your face.
Am I too late? Must I wait for the next presidency?
The clown discount is only on Mondays.
You're not out of the woods yet.
Yeah. A kid-friendly unicycle bar was my big idea. Why do you ask?
You want a pint with 17 glasses to go?
Yeah since the election, I say anything for a laugh.
can I have my hat back?
I'm Sorry All Our Positions Are Filled
Would you believe this started out as a Twitter war?
You got an axe to grind, or are you just happy to see me?
So, why the contorted face?
Damn bike lanes.
Sorry, you're on the, "No Fries List". Which also includes Seltzer.
Whattya mean I made the pants too long?
I'm Sam you clown.
No judgment, Bozo.
That’s funny, usually the place is packed at this time of day.
With Sam not around, you've got pretty big shoes to fill.
Looks like the BIG TOP left without you !
Our three most popular new flavours are 'Tears,' 'Bile,' and 'Armageddon Deluge.' No kidding.
You may not believe me, but I have never heard of a clown fish sandwich.
"Sorry Bozo. Don't serve your kind no more at 'Uncle Sam's'".
Yes, I heard the one about cannibals eating you.
CIRCUS GOING -- DRINKING COMING!
Play it again, Sam! And none of that funny business!
I said not even if we were the last two people on Earth.
The image of the sad clown staring back at him reminded Sam that he really shouldn't let patrons buy him drinks.
Who is this Bozo looking at me?
If you hate kids, you shoulda got my job.
Can I interest you in our Purple Prozac Happy Ale? All the clowns are asking for it.
Yes, we bar clowns. No, it's not funny.
Would you like the Shirley Temple on the rocks?
Is Cheers still on TV ?
Like I told the others, the twelve of you need to pick a DD before I serve you.
The scientific evidence is overwhelming! Vaccines also cause coulrophobia.
Mom's so happy she lived long enough to see me get a serious job. You should think about that.
This month's special is a Cyanide Shooter.
High cholesterol isn't funny.
So they promised you The Greatest Show On Earth, and it was just a totally overrated three ring circus!! Sad!
…BOB IH
Sorry, we don't serve free tap seltzer.
Send in the clowns!
Are you as confused as I am?
Sorry Ronald , Sam's doesn't want you either .
No, we ain't got pie in the face, and we ain't got seltzer on tap neither--whad'we look like, a clown bar?
Yes, WE are still open.
The circus doesn't close until May. I'll have a Sad Clown Special for you then.
I beg to differ. Adult vomit is entirely more problematic than child vomit.
Sam, you look a mess. How long is it going to take you to get yourself together? I can't keep pretending to be you any longer. Plus this place doesn't make enough money.
You need more blonde hair.
There's always room for a clown.
The chicken didn't taste funny to me.
Hey Bozo, there's no beer before 9:00 a.m.
How's it scaring?
A little early for a gin and tonic, don't you think, Phil?
Go get your owner to pay.
For you we always give a straw.
Ringling Brothers have closed their account.
This is a magic mirror sir.
Yes, the Mary Kay people said that you were napping there.
Bozo, I am really sorry, that after a 146 years, you were pushed off the circus wagon.
I guess they fired the clowns after downsizing the elephants.
Im sorry we dont serve your type here
I told you Absinthe wouldn't make it grow fonder.
Sorry, but for you we don't open till just past closing time.
Me dyslexic? Don't make me laugh, you nwolc!
I play it twice a day. Doesn't matter. They get here when they get here.
Well, we have each other, at least.
My birthday's tomorrow.
No, we don't got no animal crackers.
Like I said last week, no clowns, no jugglers, and no mimes.
Awf'lly diff'rent now...don't get many clowns much anymore.
What'll it be? Sasparilla?
That's a clown question, bro.
You're restroom eligible after your first paid soda pop."
We don't serve Sad Clowns here.
Play it again, Sam!
You said you'd never stop smiling
Happy Hour? Caveat emptor, pal.
What's the matter, did you fart in the clown car?
Alice, I never promised you a rose garden!
We don't serve funny drinks.
So Ringling Brothers is going out of business, huh?
Well, does my form fitting apron amuse you?
What this country needs is a 5 cent latte
Every day i tell you! We don't serve green eggs and ham.
Yes, we have funnel cakes on tap.
We don't allow talk like that in here Mr. President, take it outside please.
There will always be rough times in life so don't judge people straight away.
Yeah, I heard about Barnum & Bailey quitting the circus biz, but that don't mean that I have to listen to some clown crying in his beer.
With the circus closing down, let's not make this a habit.
I know, I know...it's hard to find a great dress for this inauguration, right? Don't worry, maybe they'll all be laughing on the inside.
I suppose, Professor, that Calculus is funny when you look at it thru Clown Glasses. Another fizzie?
So you’re depressed because the doors won’t fall off your car?
Are you sure about that? The meat wagon already picked up three clowns who order a Four-Year Bender.
It's not a joke were closed
Sorry, you're closed.
Sorry dude we don't serve bears even funny ones
how was your day
Yes, we do still have them here, but they are all pink and require at least 5 shots to perform.
How 'bout a beer and a smile?
Quit clowning around Sam, we need to get back to business.
Sorry, President Trump has reinstated prohibition, except in his buildings.
I did hear that there's a new Clown that's really killing it.
Told you cesium was no substitute for old fashioned seltzer.
You have a nice rye smile
No, I'm afraid we no longer offer valet parking.
The Ringling Pedophobia Support Group is next door.
That's the first time I've heard that listening to 2 years of 24 hours a day coverage of Donald Trump can bring back Smallpox.
Cheer up! You might find a new wave of inspiration coming up.
No severance? Sorry, I'm not Ringling, Barnum or Bailey.
What time is the kids' party?
I knew I should have taken sick leave.
The flower would be a better look in the lapel
I'm sorry, Hopsy. We don't have Circus City IPA on tap.
You hiring?
Your circus act sounds about the same as our Happy Hour.
I heard Cirque du Soleil is hiring.
Sorry, but I'd prefer a tip to watching your latest performance guaranteed to win you everlasting fame and fortune.
There is not enough room under this big tent.
Sorry, I don't know how to make a hanky dance
Sorry Ronald, for free eats look for the Arches.
mom was right, I should go to therapy..
You kind of look different from your ID. Sorry, but I can't confirm that you are 21
Again, your uncle doesn't work here and I don't know about your benefits.
That would be a bad jester to the community.
Sorry, Mr. Trump. No monee, no drinkee.
How have you been Bob? The elephants just passed through, and we are out of Bailey's too.
You sure you're not looking for Sam's Fun Zone?
Are you going to squirt me?
Cheer up, drinks are on the house for circus clowns.
…but didn’t you know you would be expected to actually do something as POUTS?
Give me the usual, but no seltzer this time.
Yes, I am sad. Ringling HR has arranged a job in Trump's inner circle for me.
Its spotted COW not CLOWN and not on tap today.
Hmm let me think....Beer!...Yeah, beer usually turns a "frown upside down".
Get the large draft-the small is 'PennyWise'-drunkard foolish.
My therapist keeps telling me I need to clown around more, but you guys have always scared the hell out of me.
Are funny bones on the menu?
Sam, we need to discuss your appearance - it's dragging down business.
What makes you think I have dry tap?
Sorry.....Mr. Smiley picked up your order.
I'll have a large SMAS, please.
Let me guess. You've just been let out of a circus and your name is Sam.
Yes, I heard about the circus closing, but jerks and clowns are completely different occupations
No, sorry, I don't have a son…
Did you ever find your fish?
What'll ya have? Fountain of Youth? Or Laugh Track?
Sorry Jack, but I think you've hit your limit
they stared eye to eye wondering who's job was worse in awe
You STILL won't admit that he made America great again???
I've been co-opted by the Commander-in-Chief.
I'm sorry, we are all out of barrels. I'll let you jump out from behind the counter if it makes you feel better.
I told you the triple gin fizz would have deleterous results.
Editors: PLEASE de-enter my caption entry for last week: "The Trumpet did sound." THANK YOU!
Don't bother
Our mocha milk stout is laughing on the inside too.
The comedy is only beginning.
Sorry, you're not scary enough for a Long Island Tea.
I know what you are thinking...I should of been a CPA.
Sam the clown wants in again.
eventually everyone who believe I might be smart will realize their mistake and everything i have gained through luck and bullshit will unravel
"I am not afraid (full inhale). I am NOT afraid (slowly exhale." Robert L Ferrante Shelton CT
Sorry, we don't serve any funny food.
We are prohibited by Federal law from selling you a cream pie unless you have a prescription.
Fired huh? I warned you not to tweet the Tramp.
Wow! ...and your fallback career was a high wire act?
No. For the last time I will not trade you root beer float for a dog made out of a twisted up Dog balloon.
The first rule of Sam's Club (in a post-Amazon world): You do not talk about Sam's Club
Different uncle
No, you're in New York, NOT Washington!
Mr. President, your Uncle will be so happy to see you back at his restaurant after all these years!
What are you having, Boozo?
Sorry pal it's closing time
We haven't had Blatzo on tap for 30 years.
I'm trying to change the stigma, we aren't all jerks anymore...
I see 2017 will be the year of the forlorn clown.
You can order all three if you promise not to chuggle em'
No more Beer thru your Flower, Buddy
No, I don't want to be your best friend- Yes, I'm lonely, but also terrified of you!
How 'bout a bit of the bubbly?
I can legally sell beer to clowns, but that means I shouldn't be selling it at all.
Here's a good one...one day, a Rabbi, a Priest, and a Minister walk into a bar
Nothing. What's s'mas with you?
You must show me your ID before buying a beer!
Would you like a comb over spritzer?
What are you looking at?
Another Sobbing Pagliacci?
You're It
They really just had termites that whole time?
Welcome to Hell--no motion and all talk.
No sir, we offer taste tests, not face tests.
Confetti, sure. Up or on the rocks?
Oh, yeah, the little car with all the people in it? They stiffed me for forty espressos about ten minutes ago so I hope YOU are good for it.
Show me that "Visit Aleppo" brochure again.
How am I supposed to know where this Sam kid lives?
Clowns are out of favor right now...but I'll give you a job...selling happiness and joy.
You're more than welcome to check the Lost and Found.
You look familiar. Have we met before?
We are not amused.
Are you going to order something other than Funyuns?
I think you got the wrong town, Mister
They sell squirt bottles next door.
The job opening is not all it's cracked up to be.
LET ME GUESS . A CLOWN FISH COCKTAIL , RIGHT ?
I'm sorry. We're out of trump.
Nah. There ain't no circuses around here.
No free beer, Bozo.
But is your dough the *greatest*?
Free advice is not my forte, but for you, go with a pitcher to start with.
Bartender: how 'bout I stop CLOWNING around and get you a drink? Clown: You think this is a joke Steve? Just hurry up and get my drink
One "mane of the lion that bit you" coming right up.
The occasion calls for something more exotic than a beer. How about a slug of Dom Perignon?
Nice work today, but mind if we talk about the rubber chicken gags?
Got laid off from Barnum? No, we don't have a vacancy.
Sorry, we're out of jokes today
sorry we are sold out of clown juice
Well you're looking good
Sorry Pal, we don't serve clown water.
Sorry Joe--you're flagged--no more sodas for you.
Would you like a drink to go with your crustless whipped-cream pie?
Sorry sir, there are no outside liquid containers allowed in this establishment.
You feel like you're only going in circles?
Sammy, I told you it was too much make-up for a political campaign. And now the circus left town, so put on an apron and join Dad.
How do I make the clown stop staring?
Surely, you jester? We don't accept jokes without 2 other counterparts.
Seltzer spritzing is banned since the circus left town.
Blotto the clown, inflatable condom animals, beer and cookies...and we're still not booking kids' parties?
Oh, for Pete's sake!
"Sorry,we discontinued the elephant ice cream".
"Hmm. This one looks like he has potential".
Look, I'm sorry. The clownfish is a big seller for us.
You had to smile?
You guys sell burgers?
Still no openings since Halloween?
Vodka and soda, with a twist of arsenic?
Gotta cut you off, Chuckles, but I get your pain. Pennywise DID ruin it for the rest of you.
Listen, you've gotta stop putting color on your cheeks and get a real job.
Hey, you're that guy who always says our beer tastes funny.
Need a dopamine fix?
"Clowns are the pegs on which the circus is hung", ever hear that one?
Mom always told me to never try new experiences.
It's not like the marchers didn't see through the redundant disguise. They were just politely sparing you the acknowledgement of your act's dismal turnout.
Sorry, I don't serve seltzer in blue bottles.
Now I see that you were being literal when you said you felt like a "sad clown paint-by-number."
I'm sorry sir, we only have 3 flavors.
Sorry, a contortionist, a geek, a giraffe and a lion that hopped up on the bar applied before you.
hey bro
Did you walk in here with someone?
Okay, one more time... it's gin, lemon juice, raspberry juice, club soda, lemon slice.
The bus seems to be running late today.
I don't think ordering "clown water" is going to fool anyone...
Listen, Bozo, you've been juggling so much lately - so I understand walking away. The next guy is going to have some big shoes to fill.
If you wanna see a psychiatrist, and I think you should, mine is pretty good.
Mirror, mirror on the wall...
Do you want diet or regular?
I'm all out of spots, but you're welcome to try our stripes.
I know Ringling and Barnum& Bailey Circus is shutting down but after 146 years, you have to admit, you have had a good run.
Happy Hour starts at 4.
Soda jerk - soda clown - at least our initials are not ......
I need a drink. I was the only clown that could not get into the car and they left without me!
I'm gonna tongue-punch your clown box if you don't hurry up and order."
You've had enough; go home to your circus!
No, thanks. We're an image bar.
I see you didn't drive here today.
I told you to wipe the confetti off your shoes before you enter.
Sorry about your elephants, but we sent for clowns, plural.
My day was THE crappiest show on earth.
Sorry, but that's not what Clown Bar means anymore.
Alice, your date's here. Are you in an happy mood?
The local draft is 140 balloons plus tax.
Go on, clown, get the fuck outta my window.
Yeah - I'll have a funny Craft
And you need 50 gallons of water to what?" "Throw?
It's been a good day so far Beau. So how's yours been?
I should really get rid of the 'Tap room' sign.
Poor old Sam still can't get over losing this joint.
How about a drink on the house for a fine lady?
Before you ask, we only serve serious drinks to serous people, nothing on the light-hearted side
you look just like this guy I grew up with, Paddy O'Pickles. do you know hi— hahahaha you're so mad you people all look the same to me
Yeah , yeah I know ...' Make it one for my baby and one more for the road '
"Sorry, but we're fresh out of the seltzer that you like having sprayed all over your face"...
Since the inauguration we've been all sold out.
You'll have to come back here for that.
Sorry pal, no credit for some clown from Ringling Bros.
We don't soft serve your kind here.
No free refills.
I'm sorry sir, I haven't seen your pogo stick.
I know it's sad, PT, so bring in the clowns.
I feel like I just need to get away from it all.
Who likes CSI anyway, right?
How about rebranding as a Zombie Clown?
That's something you don't see everyday
Know your limits
Th attire won't be noticed, but no squirting. Start at 6:00 am for breakfast shift.
I'm sorry, but the 100 person occupancy limit cannot be changed for your event.
Hey, Auguste why so blue.....Oh, yeah, the PEOTUS is giving clowns a bad name. Anything's on the house.
Before you order, we're out of maraschino cherries.
Obviously, ‘rubber chicken’ meant something entirely different to the others involved.
I didn't know jokers were still around, it's 2017 you are a little late.
Is this sam kind of a joke?
I didn't hire a clown this is a bar!
I don't know what you're thinking.
Trick or Treat.
I believe you copied down the wrong addrtess for the birthday party!
How's your new life going, Bobo? Oh! I'm sorry, Bob.
Is this not Sam's birthday?
You do know - Clowns are only served Thursday to Saturday 1:00 to 5:00!!
Yes, this place used to be the 'Barnum and Bialy' deli. But it's also closed.
Ringling's is closing--make that a Funky Monkey!
Beer? Yes. Tears? No.
You've tapped me out. Try La Croix.
Sorry, a seltzer bottle won't work. You still need ID to drink here.
2020 isn't *that* far away Mr. Junebug.
Welcome to ZAMZ
And remember, this gun isn't pointed right at your heart.
I'm DAS.
So you want to be our spokesperson if we change our name to McSam's, is that right?
Ringling's last office happy hour was a subdued affair
No Spumoni until you remove all the lines you drew on the window and countertop!
We don't serve sundaes, clown.
Sam don't serve clowns like you.
Are you sure you were in Slipknot?
This isn't what I meant when I said we needed to liven the place up!
I don’t care if your Chihuahua has herpes, you’re scaring away my Happy Hour business.
Hey, brighten up. I'm sure you'll catch on with another circus.
Exactly what does the Ringling Brothers Circus' closing and rocky road have to do with me?!
uncle Sam says to serve all clowns Donny.
Tell me more about this clown fish sushi bar across the street.
Are they just going down the alphabet now?
Theres something funny about that guy?
Break your funny bone?
You say you have experience serving pies and what?
It's one damn thing after the other at Sam's.
Well, maybe you need to brighten up the show.....a little magic, some juggling, a pop gun. But lose the flower, Bozo.
It's called Method acting. You call on your emotional memory. Now do you want cream or milk with your coffee? Oh careful, it's really hot.
Another hemlock?
I'll have a beer, but this time don't make it taste funny.
With that last beer, I sense that I over-served you, but I can call a cab for you.
One for the woods, coming up
sorry, we sold out our cream pies.
Where's Sam?
No, I'm already seeing someone.
Can I have your new White House clown sundae please?
I'm afraid you're a bit early; Pantone's color of the year for next year is "clown".
What, did you get juggled?
Cash only. This isn't your first rodeo.
I think you've mimed enough.
You're saying I'm funny...like a clown?
Maybe you should have invested in a real mystery shopper, Sam.
The Flavor of the Week is 'I Don't Like Clowns'.
Hello! I'm looking for SMAS.
Bud Weiser stops in at Sam Adam's, just to clown around.
Do you like green eggs and ham? You can get them here and chase them with a beer.
What will it be, liquor or a joint.
This is "Sam's Serious Saloon, Sir"...
What the hell do you mean that there is no HAPPY Hour!
So then I says, "Get a look at this... a... guy."
Keep Moving! It is bad for the town, having a clown that is down.
...some bozzo's prefer being splashed with seltzer.
Can you move away from the window I don't want people to think everyone in here is a "clown".
I'm sorry we had to let you goBozo, but the customers were just getting tired of the act.
Unlike your passengers, refills aren't endless.
I'll give you a free drink if you give me your hat and a nice smile.
I'm going to have to card you.
Sorry, Bud, you've already had one too many.
We have the right to refuse business to anyone.
No, Mac, there's no siphon policy for bringing your own seltzer.
Sorry, you're in the wrong place. This is not a slapstick cartoon.
Sorry, we don't serve funnel cakes.
Yeah, we'll fill up later, but I'm thinking Yelp meant the other kind of sad clown.
Sorry no BoZo Beer served here.
Looks like someone need a "BUD"DY!!
If you want a Blowjob, you can forget it.
No, you're literally clowning around.
Occupational hazard.
As Time Goes By...
No scoops for you, clown.
No, ludicrous gestures and ridiculous behavior are not allowed.
But Pagliacci, I *am* Sam the barman!
I heard...the circus is closing right?
No, beer is not going to make you funnier!
Don't be sad. You can always find a new vocation. Sam I am. I used to be a clown too but now I am a jerk!
Sam! We got another one, I don't know if our client's real or not, can you verify him? Excuse me, I've had issues before...
Quit clowning around. Do you want fries with your order or not.
We don't have a Happy Hour gig.
Depends... Going to or coming from?
2-for-1 Happy Hour ended 5 minutes ago...
Finally!
sam? is that you?
why is he staring at me like that?... I wonder if I look funny?
Would you like that made light or heavy?
Sam's will make your frown turn upside down
I'm sorry; we don't serve esprit.
Hey, Trump. Stop clowning and give your Uncle Sam his hat back.
First the elephants...now the Big Show. I can serve tables on "children pay their weight nights"?
Sorry we don't serve clowns here.
did you steal one of my tomatoes or is that your nose?
Ringling Brothers?
I'm sorry, Chuckles. But I'm sure Rover is in a better place.
I feel your pain, but you're too late. The highest office in the land is already taken. So what's your poison?
CLOWNS'MAS Blues?
Sorry Emmett, we don't have sugar-free pistachio.
Smiling Against Make-up Support is one block east.
Sorry, we don't serve cocoa
How bout you, pal? Was it the footnotes or the endnotes?

And NOW I have seen it all.
Today's special is half-price Kool-Aid.
I heard Ringley's shut down. What's next?
Hey Don, you gave it your best shot.
Clever color combination...excuse my alliteration
Dianne, we liked you more before you started appealing to our populism.
Didn't I warn you about toaster ovens?
Laugh if you want, but my friends call me Smaz.
Do you want me to play it again?
(Double-sided window)
I'm cutting you off.
So sad. I did not know that the circus was closing.
No, you can't have a doggie bottle for your seltzer water.
Mine is now history, you have few more months left to cheer for yours.
A pot and a beer?
You just them - they all just piled in a car and drove off.
Your interpretation of our 'Clown Sundae' special is literally incorrect.
I'm telling you there aren't any birthday parties in here today, I suggest you try WEST Boulevard, this is EAST Boulevard.
My other suit is at the dry cleaners!
I'm sorry, sir, but we can refuse customers alcohol if they are already intoxicated.
Really, as an example of cosmetic surgery by a graduate of clown college its really not too bad!
Same here, if you really think about it...
I am sorry, but Seltzer just doesn't sell in this market.
Your dream to run WAS to run away with the circus....
Sad clown, happy clown, it don't matter, we DO NOT give away free beer at ZMAZ'S!
What's a Godzilla Burger?
Identical twins , well we used to be...
No soup for you!
Oh No! Now that the circus is gone, this place will be clown headquarters.
Have you considered dentistry?
Sammy you, too, could be out of work one day!
I heard they're closing - just hired one of their ex-jugglers to handle the busy shifts
Sam mentioned you'd be stopping by.
There's no clowning around in the bar business!!
Give me a brewski and let me speak to s'mas
We don't give happy hours.
Sure, you can take an application, but I'm gonna tell you now, it's between you, Sudsy and Salty and the circus still hasn't notified the acrobats.
I am sorry but we are not accepting customers from the C.L.O.W.N. community.
Sorry, the job opening was filled by the circus juggler, besides, your skills and experiences would be more appreciates in a place like Washington, D.C.
Before you start, pal, I've already heard your joke.
Breaking out in spots, I see.
Sorry, Joy on tap has been discontinued until further notice.
Sorry, we're all outta the Resistance Plate.
we should not have left the robot vacuum run unattended.
What do want on your Trump Float?
Come on, of course we don't serve Cappuccino after 10:00.
So, which one of us has impostor syndrome?
Who's the better clown here, me or you?
Yes, this is "Sam's Club" and we have seltzer bottles, but they are not for sale, much less by the gross.
You should really avoid the kiddy cocktail, buddy.
No, you can't pay with balloon animals or Bitcoin.
No ads, ever again, for a pot washer.
You may well represent "The Greatest Show on Earth", but only I can pour for you "The Greatest Joe on Earth".

We don't serve smiles.
I've sorry, Sir. Our seltzer supplier was killed by a pack of wolves early this morning.
Sorry, mac, I'm out of balloon animal ale.
No, I wouldn't have guessed you're a coroner. I think it's the hat posey.
Sorry, no party sprinkles.
I didn't vote for her!
So are you applying for the soda jerk job or just clowning around?
Sure we have them, but they're pink.
If Barnum and Bailey couldn't make it, what makes you think Sam Sussman can?
You've lost your grandeur since the circus closed.
Yep, you're dying.
The special today is eggs sunny side up.
How's my grandson.
Sorry Sam, nobody wants to be served by a sad clown.
Animal Rights means you' and the elephants are out of work and I get to flip veggie burgers now!
In that case, I most definitely am not Sam.
Kombucha? You must be clowning around.
It's not April yet, sir.
It's okay, there's no one around.
No, Mr. Kerwith, I will not say I'm low on seltzer just for fun.
Creepy clowns are outside my target market.
Got to check your ID, with that make-up you must be a pre-teen.
American Gothic
Will it squirt yogurt?
What has Barron been tweeting about you?
Ouch!
The problem with your insulting, tasteless, costume is that I'm not Sam.
No, actually the owner is the rapper 2'MA2.

Stop clowning around, what'll have?

I guess my PIN was hacked.
Kid, it's alright, I've just had a few too many....
Sam's not here now...

What'll you be, Mac?
Quit clownin', yo! :)
I was long donkeys.
So, you need a pop or two before you can be a scary clown.
No, I don't get off work until eleven. Maybe Craig would go with you... but he doesn't really like Harvey Keitel.

I believe putting Samuel's on your sandwich board was not really creative advertising.
What kind of a disaster got YOU here?
I'd love to see a dance, I'm just not allowed to serve it down there.
Bring me a big burger, broiled in butter, with bacon, blue cheese and barbecue sauce for Bozo's breakfast. He has a death wish.
You may be my brother, but self-identifying as a clown doesn't intimidate me into giving a Hillary strategist a job.
Add 'hed' at the end if you've have enough.
