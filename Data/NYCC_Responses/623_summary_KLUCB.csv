4935,3498,1,10,69,80,1.15,0.04393608706786989,623,You'll have to put him in the overhead bin.
4920,3498,2,8,70,80,1.15,0.047400795805956415,623,That's not funny.

2408,3498,2,8,70,80,1.15,0.047400795805956415,623,"Well, OK, as long as it's a comfort dog."
3468,3498,2,8,70,80,1.15,0.047400795805956415,623,"I understand you’re testing the limits of gravity and physics, but your dog is testing our patience by pooping over all the other park guests."
2371,3498,2,8,70,80,1.15,0.047400795805956415,623,Looks like someone is hoping for a lightning storm.
2402,3498,0,12,68,80,1.15,0.04017367360141355,623,Please be sure to pick up after your kite.
1247,3498,3,6,71,80,1.15,0.05062895554167108,623,"You'll have to come with me sir. We don't allow dogs ""off ground"" in this city."

185,3498,1,10,69,80,1.15,0.04393608706786989,623,He's just gassy.
851,3498,2,8,70,80,1.15,0.047400795805956415,623,I don't care if your dog is high as a kite. You're scaring the kids.
812,3498,0,12,68,80,1.15,0.04017367360141355,623,"Inform your dog, this is an off -leash park."
667,3498,2,8,70,80,1.15,0.047400795805956415,623,Sorry but you’ll need to fly that at the Trump Skeet and Balloon Park.

425,3498,0,12,68,80,1.15,0.04017367360141355,623,He always had high hopes.
341,3498,3,6,71,80,1.15,0.05062895554167108,623,"The dog has to leave,he is higher than a kite."
