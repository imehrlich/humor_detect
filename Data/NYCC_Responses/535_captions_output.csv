You and your surfaris.
I just couldn't 'catch and release because who would've believed such a whale of a tale?
Of course I knew I was marrying a mermaid. I just didn't expect to live with my mother-in-law too.
I'll bet that last restaurant will never have "All You Can Eat Shrimp" on their lunch menu again.
Yes, I love him. I'll always love him. I'm just saying I still think the hospital switched him at birth.
He wants to know if you can move your seat up
It's the only way he'll fall asleep.
He's not endangered. He's wearing a seatbelt.
At least when we brought home the elephant, we had extra trunk room.
This is where the blubber meets the road.
It's the only way to get him to fall asleep.
They warned us not to feed him the growth hormone before we returned the rent-a-car.
Cop said he had to issue me a cetacean.
I was with you on "Save the Rainforests" and "Save the Monarch Butterfly" but this is a bit too much."
He hates the interstate, but he loves the car wash.
I swear the ad said "single white male."
It's the only way I get him to sleep.
Since we're getting it all out, I never liked your cat.
So much for the new car smell.
Why don't you just say what's really bothering you. And don't say "the whale" again.
At least the new car smell is gone.
Already? You would think he'd have a bigger bladder.
Okay, we saved him - now what?
So I finally saved one. Now what should we do with it?
The one millionth visitor to Aquaworld. And you couldn't just take the cash prize?
We'll see what the Smiths and their stupid dolphin have to say now.
Come on, we agreed; I catch them; you clean them.
He likes to listen to podcasts.
This is why I hate helping you move.
When the trooper gets to the window, let me do the talking.
At least now we won't look like hypocrites driving around with a 'Save the Whales' bumper sticker.
I don't complain about the junk in your car.
Quit your blubbering back there.
Then why did you have the bumper sticker?
Ok, we freed Willie. Now what?
O.K., we saved it. Now what?
OK, OK, wrong sperm bank.
I think it's time we told him he's adopted.
I said we should get a hatchback, not a humpback.
I should've read the fine print when they said "adopt a whale".
The whales aren't going to just save themselves.
You have to admit, that salesman was good.
Shouldn't we buckle him in if we're truly out to save them?
When we get to Customs, just act nonchalant.
Trust me; in five years echolocation will have completely replaced GPS.
Ever wonder how he knows we are taking him to the vet?
I didn't realize "Save the Whales" included transportation.
Worms. What did you use?
Will you quit your blubbering back there!
This is the last time we buy seafood at Costco.
Warning - "Objects in mirror are bigger than they appear"
There goes the "new car smell."
He keeps asking to listen to some podcast.
We're at the border.......... I'll do the talking!
If I hear any more blubbering back there, I'm going to stop this car.
I didn't say anything when you took all those seashells.
How many do you plan on saving?
... "hatchback"... "humpback", it's an honest mistake...
We could've just gotten the bumper sticker.
I'm tired of him spouting off. Next time he swims home.
OK. Willie's free. Now what?
Hey back there, stop your blubbering!
We saved him. Now what?
Call it the Mother Theresa approach,'If you can't save all the whales, just save one.'
Oh, like you NEVER bring work home with you.
OK, we saved a whale. Now what?
Next time, I'm thinking catch and release.
I think he'd do much better in a different school.
I really miss that New Car smell
Not all hitchhiking whales are killer whales.
He hates going to the vet.
I got him registered as a service animal.
No, I CAN'T move my seat up any farther.
Now we'll see how smug the Johnsons are about their rescue dog.
My Dad said his first car had fins, too.
Because I believe that Save the Whales should mean more than a bumper sticker. That's why.
I wanted to buy a goldfish, but this was all that Costco had.
One more block and she'll be out like a light.
How much bigger are objects supposed to appear in this mirror?!
The kids are awfully quiet.
Couldn't we have just bought the bumper sticker?
The hotel soaps were one thing....
There it is again. You're telling me you don't hear that sound?!
What's the big deal. We're going to Sea World, he's going to Sea World.
I think they'll still want a puppy.
How many whales do you plan on saving?
We always buy more than we need at Costco.
What’s the point of a hybrid if you can’t save the whales?
OK. We have a whale. Next on the list is a tire from a B-17.
He looks smaller in the mirror.
You know, most couples start with a dog.
Couldn't we have just opted for the 'Save the Whales' bumper sticker?
Maybe we shouldn't buy our fish at Costco.
Don't worry, things always look larger in those mirrors.
I told you objects in the rear view mirror look closer than they appear
What we don't eat tonight, we'll freeze.
You should have spouted before we left.
What do they mean by "objects in mirror closer than they appear"?
Did you feel a hump back there in the road?
Objects in mirror are larger than they appear.
He was cute, you said. He won't get that big, you said.
Now we have to find a pet friendly motel with a pool.
Maybe we should rethink Costco.
That squeaking noise? The mechanic said it was just a fluke.
You do know that the souvenir shop also sold t-shirts.
Look, he said he was endangered, what was I supposed to do, not give him a ride?
And how exactly do you intend to free Willy?
I don't think "save the whales" means bring them to church.
I could have sworn their website said "a whale of a sale", not "sale of a whale".
I'm having second thoughts about this whole sperm donor thing.
"For me, the free whale closed the deal.
I can still smell the beach.
I think they will like it. Everyone brings wine.
If he dies, you have to flush him down the toilet.
Most people just pickup a couple shells.
Don't let him pick the music. He likes all this high-pitched squealing stuff.
I always wanted a car with fins.
Well, you can't expect him to walk.
Seafood's just cheaper at Costco.
Ever since we left the beach, the kids haven't said a word.
It's not his breath that bothers me; it's that I have to put my seat all the way forward.
I know it will be crowded but you know how much he loves the beach.
When do you think we should tell him he's adopted?
On the plus side, we get to use the carpool lane.
we've got to stop shopping at Costco.
What exactly are we saving the whales from?
What did you think I meant when I said I wanted to be a sperm donor?
Are you saying the krill is gone?
Remember when our biggest worry used to be the elephant in the room?
I clearly said hatchback.
The migration of the humpbacks seemed a lot more majestic before they started hitchhiking.
Look, give it a rest. If you were endangered, I'd give you a ride too.
You know why they kicked us out of the apartment, right?
Next time, we go to Costco with a list.
Our concern should've ended with the bumper sticker!
Objects in mirror are closer than they appear
So we're gonna fight about this now too?
When you suggested we use the Sperm Bank, I apparently misunderstood.
Next time, just offer to bring wine, okay?
Ok, ok...next time we want fish we won't go to Costco.
See what happens when you buy seafood from Costco?
Next time the vet is coming to our house.
I told you, the sign said 'Free the Whales,' not 'Free Whales.'
What are you blubbering about back there?
I finally catch something and you're complaining?
This is bigger than both of us.
It's just until he finds a place of his own.
The poor guy probably doesn't even know that we are going to the b-e-a-c-h.
I would've preferred a blue whale too... But at some point you've got to be practical.
Where did you say you found that sperm donor?
I wish you would have left him at home so he doesn't go spouting off during dinner.
You sure about this? The goldfish only lasted a week."
This is the last time I order the Seafood Surprise.
You're the one that keeps saying we've got to save them!
Hatchback. Humpback. Reasonable mistake.
That Costco membership has really been saving us money.
I tried to leave him home but he wouldn't stop blubbering.
Please tell me you didn't throw the receipt away.
All I know is that it's closer than it appears in the mirror.
There's a catch
If you call me Ishmael one more time, I'm calling a divorce attorney.
I swear, the salesman said hatchback, not humpback.
And you thought dog breath was bad.
You're right, he's getting too big for the car seat.
I could've sworn they said 'hatchback'.
The kids are kind of quiet, don't you think?
I told you at the pet store, "Sure, it's cute now... but it's going to get bigger."
I feel like such a fool now that you explained sperm donation to me...
I caught it -- you clean it.
This is the last time I ever help you move.
How was I supposed to know he was gonna sing the whole way?
My dad's car had fins.
He came out of the blue.
You understood when it was a therapy dog.
Turn it up. He loves this podcast.
I could have sworn the salesman said "hatchback."
Next time, pay the damn delivery fee.
I told you I was good at carnival games.
Relax, everything looks bigger and closer in the rear view mirror.
You smell it too?
I ordered a Hatchback and they gave me a Humpback.
Would it be rude to stop for sushi?
I just couldn't pass up Sea World's going out of business sale.
Oh you wanted okra. The text said orca.
If you guys want to stop for plankton, I know a good spot.
No legs. Needed a ride. What else could I do?
So go ahead. Call me Ishmael.
So maybe we can just do a "Save the Whales" bumper sticker next time?
Well, you're the one who said if I could catch him I could keep him.
Now do you believe me that sea levels are rising?
Now that we saved one, no more protests, OK?
Was that you?
I can't handle another hour listening to that blow hole.
Their migration routes are unpredictable.
That's not what I meant when I said we should hump back there.
Maybe you should drive ... the LSD is kicking in.
What is he blubbering about this time?
I'm pretty sure I said "hatchback", not "humpback"...
Look, I don't care how it actually happened, but you've got to stop saying it's just a fluke.
Next year we take the Greenpeace tote bag.
Okay, that's the downside of shopping at Costco.
Come on, how often does Sea World have a clearance sale?
Usually this makes her fall asleep.
Maybe getting the sushi at Costo wasn't such a good idea.
You want to save the whales only when it's convenient for you.
Because he doesn't bark out the window, that's why.
I think we're in Melville.
It says your drop-off location is the Pacific Ocean, is that correct?
You know you can download whale sounds, right?
Can't you just bring shells home like everybody else?
Hatchback, Humpback--there's just no pleasing you, Janice.
I told you that buying a raffle ticket in Iceland was not a good idea
Hunters do it with deer all the time.
We freed Willy. Now what?
In a couple years she'll be old enough to drive herself to swim practice,
He's not heavy, he's my blubber.
Great. You-know-who is being a humpback-seat driver again.
Would you have let him stand there with his flipper out?
I don't think this is what they meant by 'adopt a whale.'
I told them I wanted a car with fins.
You know he hates being left alone at home.
Define "save."
Well, at least he stopped blubbering.
What about my sperm count?
It's just for a few days, until he can find a new apartment.
Let's stop at Red Lobster and scare the hell out of the manager.
Remember, when we get to the drive-in, he's 12.
He always spouts off when he's in the backseat.
Look at this big jerk tail-gating.
Objects may be closer than they appear.
If I only have a picture they'll say it's Photoshopped.
It's a fish called Honda
Turn up the radio if you don't like his singing.
I want to save the whales as much as the next guy. But, couldn't we just give money?
Let's hope he doesn't get car sick
Is it just me or have you also noticed that The New Yorker seems to be preoccupied with whales?
The rear Right Whale is out of alignment.
Trophy wife, trophy fish, don't make me choose.
Hatchbacks are out. Humpbacks are in.
I suppose now we have to stop at Costco and get 90 tubs of tartar sauce.
I hope there's not a pool at the party, or we'll never get him back in the car.
You think I should have thrown it back, don't you?
Fine, go ahead and blame it on spellcheck, but how was I supposed to know that you meant to type "hatchback?"
And where are we going to find plankton at this time of night?
This totally justifies our Costco membership.
You said you wanted to get your father something that would remind him of your mother.
It's the smallest size they have at Costco.
Why didn't you blow before we left?
sometimes the Costco portions seem out of hand.
Well, what did you think I was going to withdraw from the sperm bank?
The salesmen told me that echo location is much better than GPS.
Damn! The car keeps fishtailing.
He called me Ishmael.
So, is this your first time in a carpool?
I really don't think that's what they mean by "Save the Whales".
Don't worry. It's a hatchback whale.
You know I can't leave him at home when we go to the beach.
The sign said "FREE Willy"! How could I ignore a free whale?
I don't care what your sonar is telling you, the GPS says we should turn left.
Yes, but think of the Omega 3.
We dropping off your mom first?
I don't mind saving them, but I could do without the attitude.
The new sonar feature is great for parking.
Am I being paranoid, or is that guy tailing us?
At least we don't have to walk him.
Next year let's put him in a school closer to home.
I spy something blue.
I swear I heard the salesman say 'hatchback.'
I thought I was entering a contest for a 'hatchback'.
Wouldn’t Greenpeace be just as happy with a donation?
Admit it - you think I should have thrown it back, don't you?
YOU tell him to buckle his seatbelt.
So........How'd it go at the Sperm Bank?
Stop that blubbering, we're almost there!
It handles great, because the weight's in the back
"Let Jonah go to the beach!" you said. "He'll have fun!" you said.
Well, I don't have a low sperm count anymore.
I could have sworn the dealer said "hatchback."
I hope that next year we play a football team with a mascot that's easier to steal.
Actually, once he hears my car keys he jumps in all on his own.
Quit blubbering back there!
I couldn't stand that new-car smell.
It's called catch and release , catch and release , but no you had to keep him .
I know, I know. I catch it, I cook it.
Do the kids seem unusually quiet back there?
I wanted a hatchback, not a humpback!
I think it's time we addressed the whale in the car.
He think's we're getting krill. Don't mention the m-a-r-i-n-e b-i-o-l-o-g-i-s-t.
You only asked if I was a dog person or a cat person.
yes I guess you can finally block my access to the "free stuff" section on Craigslist
Couldn't we have just opted for the bumper sticker?
Next year let's go to the mountains
Objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are.
Why can't we keep him?
Why are you so annoyed? It's my first traffic cetacean ever.
Next vacation--no more souvenirs.
Seashells are for tourists.
I'm having second thoughts about this, maybe we should go with a Koi pond instead.
And you laughed when I packed the harpoons.
I thought the Adopt-a-Whale program was merely a fund-raising gimmick.
Don't worry, it's just a fluke.
Just once it would be nice to go to a restaurant without him complaining about the lack of krill on the menu.
I don't know. For some reason it just doesn't have that new car smell.
Catch-and-release may have been a better way to go.
He said, "Are we there, yet?"
What are you blubbering back there?
I'll tell you something else that's endangered.
Before you know it, you'll wonder how we ever got along without one.
The car is fishtailing
You let the littlest things bother you.
See if there's a breath mint in the glove compartment
Next time, Catch and Release!
I said hatchback, not humpback, to the rental agent, right?
Stop being a Dick
Just driving a hybrid with a "save the whales" bumper sticker would have been a bit too cliché.
Yeh, well I say, whatever happens in Nantucket stays in Nantucket.
Wait till you see the fishbowl.
Stevie's been awfully quiet since we left the aquarium.
I'm not sure I understood all the details when I clicked on "I Agree"
I am O.K. with ignoring the elephant in the room, but can we please discuss the whale in the backseat?
That's the last time you ask, 'what can we bring?'
He'd be no less endangered if I'd left him on that beach.
I thought they said rear "wheel" drive.
OK, my mistake. Something smells mamally in the back seat.
He wants to know whether you can see any plankton stuck in his teeth.
An Uber driver is never surprised.
That was some tornado.
It's only to Baltimore. He said he'd buy the gas.
Think we should stop for water?
A whale landing on the car is more than a fluke.
Call me A-cab.
We made the deal - I catch it, you bone it.
Just like everything else with you the koi pond wasn't enough.
How much bigger do objects appear in the rear view mirror?
Yes, I know humpback and hatchback aren't the same thing...NOW.
We're being tailed, big time.
We can't visit your mother without bringing something.
Keep an eye out for the Melville exit.
I think we should stick to dog rescue.
I told you not to feed him. Now he's gunna follow us all the way back to the mainland.
This isn't what I meant by car pool
Look, we got him in, we can get him out!
No, some marine biologists do take their work home with them.
Did you remember the plankton?
Sorry, what sperm bank were you talking about?
We can do better, you said. The elephant in the room was too cliche, you said.
It's tough playing these dives after headlining at Sea World.
Trust me, now we can use the HOV Lane
So how was I to know this car had been through a flood?
Remember when cars had fins on the back?
Let's rethink Costco for cat food.
I can't wait to see Ahab's face when I pull into the driveway.
You’re still bored?
This should be a tough meet. I've heard that Phelps kid is pretty good.
For some reason I remember the prizes being a lot smaller. And in a baggie.
You're the one who said you wanted to save the whales.
Yeah, but we get to use the carpool lane.
You caught it, you want it home, you bone it!
It looked smaller in the store.
It was you who told our son he could be anything.
Can we at least agree that "You'll never fit that in there" could have been interpreted as a challenge?
I bet you can't guess what happened when you were sleeping.
Guess who ate all the shrimp again?
Who ever thought SeaWorld would just give them away?
The great thing about our new navigation system is that it uses sonar!
At least he doesn't keep us up all night barking.
Why couldn't you blow before we left the house?
At least he doesn't shed...
You had to choose the sonar GPS.
What ever happened to catch and release?
Did you know objects in your rear view mirror are also larger than they appear to be?
Really!? This is how we save the whales?
'Let's sign up to be Uber drivers. How bad can it be?' you said!
Those sale items at Costco are always so hard to resist.
Tail fins are back in
Maybe we should address the whale in the car?
I'm sure I said hatchback not humpback.
I couldn't remember whether you wanted the hatchback or the humpback.
I love the new Whole Foods.
Don't tell him we're going to the vet. Last time he blubbered the whole way there.
We're going to need a lot more tartar sauce.
Stop looking at me like I made a huge mistake.
Well, perhaps we should go to the ocean first, and then go to Costco.
Maybe we've taken this whole Greenpeace thing a bit too far?
Plankton again? Why does he always get to decide what's for dinner.
Maybe we should've stuck with rescuing cats.
I tried flushing it down the toilet.
Call me Imbecile.
Oh, settle down! She called 'shotgun' fair and square.
I wish you had told me about your emotional support animal before I booked our flight.
Lets call him Ishmael.
Do you hear someone singing?
Fine, but he's not allowed to sleep in bed with us.
I know you wanted a hatchback, but all they had were humpbacks.
Actually, in the case, I think the object is as big as it appears!
Well, that's the last time I'll drive through standing water.
You cannot simply decline the aquarium raffle's grand prize. It just isn't done.
You said you didn’t want a dog.
Again? We just stopped for krill an hour ago.
We had to buy it, Lois, it's the only thing at Costco that would go with the ten gallon jar of tartar sauce we bought there last weekend.
I take my bumper stickers very seriously.
That's not what I had in mind when I agreed to whale watching.
He says he can't hear the radio. Would you find a lower frequency?
You know, pet rescue isn't supposed to be a competition.
You knew I was a marine biologist when you married me.
So, you said "Get a hatchback"? I'm pretty sure you said "humpback".
Every year, it's the same with you two. Maybe I don't want to spend our vacation at the beach.
I thought you meant something different when you said we were whale watching this weekend.
Why didn't you spout before we left?!
I told you I came with baggage!
But they're so cute when they're little!
What are you blubbering about?
Keep an eye out for road krill.
I miss our elephant.
I hate when that low tire pressure light goes on for no reason.
I told you the car was fishtailing.
What? I put down a towel!
Well, I don't think he wants to be here either!
I'm allergic to dogs.
Stop that blubbering this minute, or we're turning around.
Elephant in the room? Shouldn't we be talking about the whale in the back seat?
No, I don't see another swimming pool. Can you hold it?
They were out of jumbo shrimp.
If the suspension can handle this, your mom should be okay
Remember when you used to collect seashells?
You are NEVER coming with me to Costco again!
I wanted an anxiety pet that suited my anxiety
The krill light just came on.
I found him in the deep end of the car pool.
You're right. Objects in the mirror ARE closer than they appear.
You just don't see whale for three cents a pound anymore.
You HAD to ask if we could bring anything.
I told you it would fit.
Don't be so provincial. In Europe, people take their whales everywhere.
We've had an elephant in the room for far to long.
"No, I'm sure I said a hatchback".
I think there's something wrong with the dog.
Okay. Aside from that – how do you like the car?
I told you to get a hatchback, not a humpback!
Don't you love that new carp smell?
Now we just need to pick up 4 tons of krill and then we'll be on our way home.
Oh, that reminds me...when is your mother coming?
Because he saved my life, OK?
Why did you tell him that Monterey Bay is on our way?
You're not going to let me forget this, are you?
...now, I would like to see the kids try to flush this one down the toilet
Humpback. Hatchback. You have to admit, it's confusing.
"I think catch-and-release would have been a better idea'.
If it wasn't for my allergies I WOULD get a dog.
You know he should be facing backwards at this age.
Can we address the whale in the car?
Objects...are...closer...than...they...appear....
No, I'm pretty sure it's your phone making that sound.
And you said we wouldn't catch anything.
Why did you have to order the "catch of the day?"
I swear, he only stays with us until he gets back on his feet.
You just had to buy fish at Costco!
Why shouldn't I shop when I'm hungry?
Are you positive they said 'Bring your cetacean to your court appearance'?
Don't start blubbering.
He's your friend, you tell him the carpooling isn't working out.
I would have preferred the tote bag.
You've always been judgmental of my need for an emotional support animal.
Ok, so don't call me Ishmael.
They grow up so fast, don't they?
When you said we should "save the Whales", this isn't exactly what I had in mind.
Don't make me come back there and harpoon you.
Then we agree- Junior can never again volunteer to take the class pet home for summer vacation.
Well, he is taking care of the gas ... and the oil.
You were right, Sea World's going out of business sale wasn't such a great idea.
I swear the salesman said, "Whale OF a deal."
It's not my fault; he was fishtailing all over the road.
I swear I said a hatchback.
I sense your initial doubts about my skills in the ping pong ball toss at the carnival have you feeling a little ridiculous right about now.
The krill is gone
I suppose you think we have bigger fish to fry.
I know that look. What's wrong?
Either we get a bigger car or I think it's time to free Willy.
He only needs a lift to Atlantic Avenue.
Quit your blubbering.
No, Ahab was obsessed. I'm just enchanted.
I mean it this time. This is the last stray we're taking home.
Most people usually just bring back a souvenir shell, or something.....
Got it on a pod cast
We're not going anywhere until you fasten that seatbelt.
You know that nobody will believe me if I can't show them!
Come on. You liked "Free Willy" as much as I did.
Next time let's opt for bringing the corn
Because the back seat is full; that's why your mother can't come along.
Just remember, bad decisions make great stories
He is NOT taking advantage of me. Migration is just hard for him.
The salesman said it was a fluke.
Now that we've freed Willy, what are we going to do with him?
I kind of regret buying that SeaWorld raffle ticktet.
You should have seen the one that got away.
I wish the marine biologist still made house calls.
This might not be the right time to bring this up, but I also gave money to Adopt the Rainforest.
Don't start. I have bigger fish to fry.
Is this the same fish that was in that other cartoon?
Fine, but who else can post a selfie with the hashtag, "humpback in a hatchback?"
The thing is, he was really cute as a baby.
What smell?
Well, I heard "hatchback".
Let's see them ticket me in the HOV lane NOW!
All cars used to have fins, you know.
Now do you see why I like catch and release?
Okay, I have an interesting story for you.
"Friend-of-the-Earth," my blowhole...he's killing our mileage.
I just rebuilt the engine, but I'm still getting this weird clicking sound.
I just still can't believe we got it through customs.
Hatchback? I thought you said 'Humpback'
You know, this would be easier if you were a cat person.
For the last time, stop calling me Ishmael!
Yes, I know how you feel about sand in the car.
Do you hear a pinging sound?
He just needs to drop by the sperm bank.
Now you don't want me to save the whales?
I agree- tomorrow we quit Uber.
I dunno. "Moby" is a little obvious, don't ya think?
So, did you mean, "Stop your wailing," or "Stop your whaling"?
Maybe we should have gone with the goldfish.
When you said we were adopting a rescue, I assumed you meant a golden retriever.
Objects in rear view mirror are closer than they appear
Well maybe you should've been more specific when you said "save them."
You know we're going to have to talk about it someday
Do you think this is the right whale for us?
All I know is he didn't look very happy in that theme park.
I suppose we should stop and pick up some plankton on the way home.
Is it okay if we stop for krill?
I think I just fishtailed.
You take this whole "Save" thing pretty seriously.
Now I can use the carpool lane.
It runs on Omega 3 oil. And I only have to fill up once a month.
Do we have to listen to your podcast?
I swear we're being tailed
Don't give me that look. You're the one who wanted sushi.
It gives him such joy to signal our turns.
He knows a really good seafood place.
It's a rescue.
They really need to fix the Holland Tunnel.
It is TOO a Pokemon!
With whale oil, we get 32,000 miles between fill-ups.
Did you pack the krill?
Maybe you should call me Ishmael.
That was a pretty big puddle.
I'm getting nervous about the shortage of road krill.
We're gonna need a bigger pool.
There wasn't any tuna left.
He likes Yanni. We can change the playlist when we get to Orlando.
Hatchback? I can swear you told me to buy a Humpback.
Sonar is the new GPS.
Got to hand it to you. Great payback for the white elephant they gave us last year.
He looked so much smaller in that little plastic bag.
You DIDN'T catch a bigger fish than me. That's a mammal.
It's a new ride sharing concept called blUbBER
So then I said, Call me Ishmael, and before you know it, we're giving him a ride home.
Your mother might want to cut back on her Omega-3 tablets. Just sayin'.
Why can't it swim around South America like all the others?
We'll just freeze what we can't eat.
Honest,Carol, that's the smallest whale that you can buy at Costco.
Just my second day with Uber. Why?
My sperm count's low today.
Breath mint?
Technically, it smells like mammal in here.
Okay you've proved it's roomy, but I still want to test drive the SUV.
What was that saying about objects in the mirror?
Fins on cars are coming back.
I'm 46, Karen. It was either this or an affair.
Don't look now but I think we have a tail.
Don't worry, you'll like your new school
Next time, don't click 'Uber Pool.'
Clearly, we've got bigger fish to fry!
The thing about Costco is, you buy a lot of something 'cause it's cheap and then there's the problem about where to store it when you get home.
Now, both of you, quit your blubbering!
I still want a cat
I hope you like blubber.
It wasn't me.
So, we're just not going to address the whale in the car?
Global warming has shifted their migration habits.
Oh, stop your blubbering.
Did you remember to pick up some kelp?
I know I'm a soft touch for hitchhikers...but Sea World is only 30 minutes out of our way
That was some car wash
"Save the whales, save the whales you said...so I did.
Mammal. Look it up.
You know I suggested we think about a sperm donor?
I told you they're not as cute when they get big.
He's my service pet. I take him everywhere.
Sometimes he needs to go watching too.
An elephant in the room I could handle.
Who knew that saving the whales and driving a Prius were incompatible?
Remember, the "Save the Whale" bumper sticker was your idea.
I think some of us misunderstood the word carpool.
I still say, in this day and age, a selfie with him would have been enough.
We're being tailed.
No, I said bring me back a souvenir from Wales.
How the hell do I know if there's krill at this exit?
No, you were the one who said "Save the whale!"
Who'd have guessed a hatchback could hold a humpback?
He needed a ride to the sperm bank.
OK. Yes. I'll admit that the bison calf was a mistake, but this is different.
Honestly, 'a car with fins' would've been a waste of my third wish even without a catch.
Now that I've addressed your concerns about trunk space, are you looking to buy or lease?
I said "hatchback" not "humpback".
Are you sure it wasn't catch and release?
I enjoy cooking, watching old movies, and bluegrass. And I like whales.
I knew we shouldn't have bid for the whale watching package.
Your penchant for picking up strays has finally gone overboard.
Well, I couldn't have put your mother in the back seat, and him in the trunk, could I?
I couldn't just leave it on the beach!
Need to make a quick deposit at the sperm bank...
Wake up Margaret! The car is making that sound again.
Don't worry, objects appear bigger than they appear in the mirror
Whew! That was some wave!
It uses sonar and echolocation... I'm completely hands-free.
What is it about 'catch and release' you have trouble with?
Most people settle for a puppy or kitten to rescue, but no...you always have to make the grand gesture.
Boy, that was some big puddle we just drove thru!
Next time, can we just donate money instead?
I think we're gonna need a bigger aquarium.
Did you remember to pack the whale?
You're such a skeptic. We can always get a bigger aquarium.
Oh, well if it was on sale...
Do the math, Rachel. It's only 14 cents a pound when you buy in bulk.
How about we not sing along?
Sure, Dennis-- ‘Let’s drive for Uber. It’ll be fun.’ Seriously-- does he even have a wallet?
It was on sale.
What happened to catch and release, dear?
I'm not moving until you buckle up back there.
No one likes a backseat diver.
Well, technically it wouldn't be a "fish" story.
I don't care if he followed you home, Ahab, you still can't keep him.
When you said you were going to the sperm bank, I had no idea you would bring your own whale.
What can I say? He signed up for the carpool.
Maybe I misunderstood what you meant by carpool.
OBJECTS IN MIRROR ARE WAY BIGGER THAN THEY APPEAR
Humpback? I thought you said hatchback.
Having a pet is a great way to teach kids about responsibility.
The brochure said 'Save a Whale'.
It's not that big a whale. It's just that objects in the rear view mirror appear closer than they are.
You know I like those those cars with the fins.
This is much worse than the elephant in the room.
What is it about catch and release you don't understand?
Yes, Uber says I have to pick up service animals, but I pictured a dog.
DIDN'T I TELL YOU WE SHOULD HAVE CLOSED THE WINDOWS BEFORE WE LEFT THE BEACH1
....and exactly how do you expect me to track down 40 million krill at this time of night?
Why can't you collect shells like everyone else?
If you really cared about saving the whales, you wouldn't complain about adopting a rescue.
You called the pool people, right?
Saving The Whales is tough on gas mileage
Still thinking about the one that got away...
The elephant in the room? Let's talk about the whale in the back seat!
They grow up so fast
I don't think this is what they meant when they said they needed a sperm donor
I like our new Humpback, but I wish it got better mileage.
It's in the car seat in case we get stopped, right?".
I told you to bring the big cooler.
I've got a license to krill
We've got to stop drinking and diving.
Oh, but when you brought home a new dog it was okay?
Do you feel us fishtailing a little?
Seems like I haven't heard from Jonah in three days
The singing I don't mind so much. It's the silent judgement of my driving skills that has become a problem.
I thought we agreed on catch and release.
Why can't you collect seashells?
It's painfully obvious, you think I should ask for directions.
Technically it can't smell fishy.
Why can't you crave pickles and ice cream like other pregnant women?
He said he needs a ride up the coast to meet some friends.
He may be a mammal but he drinks like a fish.
I'll never get lost with our new echolocation system.
Let's burn blubber
Sometimes I wonder if carpooling really is helping the environment.
Well at least it's not screaming, "Are we there yet?"
yes, but we do save so much at Costco.
Call me crazy, but I prefer the elephant in the room.
It depends on how you define fluke.
We can take you as far as Omaha.
Please tell me that you remembered to bring the plankton.
I'm just not a dog person.
Yes, but the price per pound was really good.
Enough with your Melville book group.
I told you not to feed him.
What? You said I could get a souvenir.
You might want to put your peg on the gas there, captain.
Okay, we rescued him from Sea World. What now?
We're gonna need a bigger koi pond.
Did the "nice man on Craigslist" mention anything about when the "Teacup whale" reaches maturity?
Listen, the guy is selling bluefin tuna for $2.99 a pound, I'm not gonna ask for a DNA test.
I always wanted a car with tail fins.
I'm sorry I ever complained about the shells you used to bring back from the beach.
I would have thrown it back, but it's not native to the Hudson River.
I didn't complain when you put in the koi pond, did I?
I told the kids he's going to a farm upstate.
Yeah, it takes more time to pick him up, but now we can use the carpool lane.
Of course I've heard of Catch and Release!
Can we please address the whale in the car?
What did you expect when the Costco ad said "bulk sushi"?
Oh c'mon, you were never a fan of that new car smell anyway!
Sometimes it's just best not to look back.
He's only hitchhiking as far as Sea World.
Why couldn't we have just gotten a cat?
I'm still not buying a minivan.
I had a really nice time tonight. Call me, Ishmael.
We need to stop for gasoline and krill.
Blübber: It's Uber for whales
No, seriously, call me Ishmael.
Are they really going to believe he just "ran away"?
Do you think we are carrying this "save-the-whale" thing a little too far?
i suppose you're wondering what happened to the donkey I brought on our last date.
You know, when I said we should capture the moment I was really just talking about a photo.
It's a hybrid . It gets 70 knots per gallon and its loaded with omega 9s.
I thought the rental agency said it was a hatchback.
I'm sure we can find a place that serves burgers and krill.
It looked smaller in the ocean.
It's only for a little while until we can find his real owners...
I am not the one taking it back when we run out of plankton.
Please, don't blubber.
How long until you think the aquarium notices she gone?
There's that funny squeaking noise again.
OK then, next year I'll practice catch and release.
I thought that fins went out in the 50's.
I promised we would take him to Seaworld !
I think your'e right, the Whale On Board sign isn't necessary.
You weren't "stranded." We were just a few minutes late picking you up.
This is the last time I'm supporting one of your PETA heists.
'Don't worry. It's a rental.'
Wow, does he ever look close.
Your dad's going to be furious when he finds the sperm on the backseat.
We need to stop for gas and krill.
Not again. He just peed an hour ago.
Could you get him to stop his blubbering already!
What? I let you take the stray cat home.
If a cop pulls us over, try 'Call me Ishmael'.
Now will you call me Ishmael?
When you said lets "Save The Whales" I didn't think you meant it literally.
I still think the aquarium is going to notice he's missing.
What can I say. I'm a sucker for garage sales.
Can you switch the radio over to sonar?
I got it at Costco.
I figure if we can keep him alive, children will be no problem.
I'm sorry, but this is going to be your last ride with Uber.
Love that new car smell.
I've got to stop and pick up some krill.
I found him ontop of my brother on the desert island. I couldn't just leave him there.
I'm driving slowly because when it's wet, this car tends to fishtail.
Usually, a "whale" of a deal doesn't mean a real one.
Sure, be that way. But it works out to, like, two cents a pound.
I don't know what to do now that he's outgrown his carseat.
You were supposed to take only memories.
Next time, can we just bring a salad?
I know it's starting to smell but this way we can use the HOV lane to beat traffic.
Now we have to talk about the elephant in the bedroom.
Will a black lab sing to you?
I think next time we should go back to our regular car wash.
He said we should call him Ishmael.
I guess this means re-thinking the Koi pond?
Fine, but you're cleaning up after it.
Something's bothering you. What is it?
Did you see how she just jumped in the backseat and curled up and went to sleep?
But the Joneses just have koi in their pond.
Yes, it's another whale. What's your point?
We'll just get shrimp, he won't know the difference.
Don't you just love that new carp smell?
We're going to need a bigger grill.
I thought you invited him.
I guess I had a different idea of what you meant when you asked if I'd like a humpback in the back seat.
So... it's one vote for Chinese, and two for seafood.
I say we beach him.
Face wise you look just like your picture, but you never mentioned the humpback.
You catch it, you clean it!
I guess I didn't understand what you meant by car pool.
Let's not get too judgy, we've all changed a lot since college.
You could have told him that Monterey Bay is not on our way.
I’d heard that you were a krill seeker…
Well.... I think it's time to address the whale in the car.
Hatchback, I said hatchback!
Well, we couldn't save it, so now what?
No, I _don't_ think adjusting the mirror is going to help.
You don't often see whales hitchhiking this far inland.
We could always consider sperm donation.
25 cents a pound, I couldn't walk away.
Don't look now, but that jerk from the beach is tailgating us again.
We can't avoid it any longer. We need to talk about the whale in the car.
The kids would have been happy with some shells or salt water taffy.
Yeah, but once we reach the Pacific, our mileage will be great!
He doesn't understand what a Car Pool is?
I'll cancel our Greenpeace membership.
This is the last time we go to the aquarium on pet rescue day.
Well, we couldn't just leave him there
You wanted tail fins--you got tail fins.
Look. I think it's time we address the 8,000 pound whale in the car.
Big mistake letting the kid bring it home. Say, where is Jonah anyway.
Please stop blubbering.
I got it for forth place in the New Yorker Caption Contest.
You were right. Whale songs are much better live.
I just wish he knew something other than "Louie, Louie."
Does it seem to you that the car is fishtailing?
We'll have to make a few adjustments to the car seat now that he's old enough to face forward.
Did you remember his sponge? He loves his sponge.
How was I supposed to know they can't hold their liquor?
20,000 leagues and you still won't ask for directions.
I miss airbags
He loves car rides! What was I supposed to do?
If she sings 'Sea Cruise' one more time, I'm going to lose it.
Sorry---I didn't know he'd be blubbering the whole way.
I have no idea . . . but he showed up right after I had the ultra-sound.
You know, sometimes I feel like he rescued me from SeaWorld.
What? We needed a third for the carpool lane.
He'll be just fine in the deep end.
OK big fella. You know the rules. This car does not move till all the seat belts are clicked.
You wanted a navigation system.
I didn't think "Adopt A Whale" was to be taken literally.
I agreed to Jonah but you never mentioned his friend.
Not in front of the W-H-A-L-E.
I'm getting a little annoyed that you keep calling him the fish.
You realize, don't you, that no one will believe us about the one that got away?
Ten cents a pound.How could I pass it up!
Do you have a better idea to qualify for the carpool lane?
Did you bring any plankton?
Really, of all the animals at the rescue shelter?
Well, next time you try to get a sitter on a Friday afternoon.
I've tried everything, even one of those little pine tree thingies.
Actually, the expression is "elephant in the room."
I thought it would be more effective than a "Save the Whales" bumper sticker.
Seriously, he's normally not like this, it was that last shot of Drambuie in the blowhole that did him in..
I'm no doctor, but there have to be easier ways to elevate your sperm count.
The salesman said it was a hatchback,not humpback.
Did anything seem weird about that car wash to you?
I didn't know the Aquarium's "Adopt-A-Whale" program was so literal.
I wonder if Costco carries krill?
Wasn't this in last weeks cartoon?
Next time, let's stick to feeding the seagulls.
Don’t make me come back there.
No, Moby, for the last time, we aren't there yet.
I thought carpooling would be a lot more fun.
Ok,four thousand Krill Burgers and a Diet Coke.What are you having?
You just "had" to save the whales, didn't you?
And you're sure this place allows pets?
Nothing interesting ever happens to us.
It didn't sound like it was going to be that far out of our way when he got in.
Are you sure this Whale Watchers Program is right for you?
What was I supposed to do? He's miles from the ocean and needed a ride.
The seats are comfortable, but it fishtails like crazy.
I'm just saying, adopting a puppy may have been more practical.
Don’t worry – this is nothing a little Febreze won’t fix.
You'll thank me when we're zipping along in the three passengers or more HOV lane!
If you can think of an easier way to qualify for the carpool lane, I'd love to hear it.
I know, but the Narwhal kept cracking the windshield.
I'm sure Amazon will have krill.
It's bad enough that we can't talk about the elephant in the room...
When you said we could hump back in the car, I didn't think you meant this
That's were you're wrong. I did get you something romantic last year.
Let's go to Starbuck's.
I don't get it. Wasn't the deal I catch, you cook?
What good's having a two-ton payload if you can't use it?
On the bright side, we only see the vet once a year.
I'm betting your mother never wants to sit back there again.
No blubbering in the back.
So, is this your first time using Uber Pool?
Perhaps a "Save The Whales" bumpersticker instead?
This sperm donor business is more work than I thought it would be.
If you teach a man to catch a whale, he won't have to fish for a lifetime.
He really hates going to the vet, doesn't he?
You should see the one that got away.
Well, she has a valid Uber account, and last time she gave me a 5-star rating.
We could have just went with the bumper sticker.
Dan. The selfie will be totally worth it.
Well, you agreed. I catch it and you clean it.
I can't believe you forgot the tartar sauce.
Did you remember to pack the krill?
All I know is that they told me that I got a whale of a deal.....
I think we should put it back where we found it
I swear, I read the fine print. Nowhere in the Adopt a Whale Program paperwork did it mention custody, let alone day trips to the beach!
Quit your blubbering or I'll turn this car around and put you back on that beach where I found you!
Yes, I'm sure: the hotel has a pool and a waterslide.
I don't know...kind of like someone left a tuna sandwich in the car.
Worst. Aquatic-themed amusement park. Souvenir. Ever.
I don't care if this is a marine sanctuary--he has no right to be tailgating me like this.
Do you think what they say about "object in mirror" is true?
I TOLD you the playdate with Jonah was a bad idea.
It's a mammal, not a fish.
When the salesman said it was a whale of a deal I just thought he meant it was a good price.
Do you think they'll accept it ? What if they already have one ?
Still think a convertible is impractical?
Who needs directions, when we've got echolocation!
You know, I think a gold fish would have been fine for a first pet.
For some reason I keep thinking of your mother.
We can take the HOV lane
this rescue pet thing is getting out of hand.
I hope they don’t call in an Ambergris Alert.
It's Adopt a Highway or Save a Whale ? I get confused.
No this is a Toyota Humpback...
Well then what exactly ARE tail fins?
Uh, yeah...what did *you* think "I brake for whales" meant?
But you knew I was a whale whisperer.
This will impress our friends much more than adopting a rescue dog.
"There are some exceptions to "Catch and Release".
Well, it was a whale of a deal.
Brace yourself - I feel another blow coming!
You're the one who's always saying that rescue pets are the best.
What does he mean, "The krill is gone from our relationship?"
Amazing what you can get in the back of a Prius
When I bought the car online I thought it was hatchback, not humpback.
You want to save the whales? I'm saving a whale.
Yes, we can drive "real slow" past the aquarium, but this is the last time.
I guess I should park close to the shore.
I think we're being tailed.
I agree, after the ride, she gets a bath!
It's not an ambiguous idiom. I literally believe our relationship will not survive the 300,000 pound baleen whale in the convertible.
I knew that net would pay for itself!
We need a bigger carpool
I thought you said your life lacked porpoise.
Think she's finally asleep?
I told you already, we need 3 for the carpool lane
I traded in my hatchback for a humpback.
It was too big to throw back .
Remind me again, how is this supposed to help save the whales?
I'm not a catch and release kind of guy.
He says he wants to stop at Starbucks.
Can we please stop talking about my low sperm count? One is a lot!
You're the one who wanted to adopt.
You're Looking at me like I did it on purpose.
Sorry buddy, but she DID call shotgun.
I'm sorry, I thought you meant we were picking up your sister.
Did you remember to get the organic, free-range plankton?
The kids are probably fine. There's a lot of room in a whale's stomach, and it's much quieter this way.
It'll be easier to get him out of the car, I promise.
But you knew marine biology was my hobby when you married me.
Did the car just fishtail?
Wanna invite the neighborhood for sushi tonight?
You're the one who had to super-size it ...
I got a letter today...the car is being recalled due to a fishtailing problem.
I don't care - he's tailgating. I'm doing the speed limit.
I’m sick of listening to whale music.
'We'll say he followed us home.'
He was cute when he was little, but he's getting a little too big to keep as a pet now.
Anyone want a mint?
Let's play that game where we try to think of something even weirder than Trump being elected president of the United States.
I don't believe in catch and release
I just don't think he'll be happy in Poughkeepsie.
At only $2.50 a pound, I couldn't resist.
Beginner's Luck.
Do we need to stop for krill?
You call this whale watching?
I told you it's roomier than it looks.
...and tomorrow you need to go to the bank, the cleaners, and the car repair shop and tell them the car feels like it's fishtailing again.
For the last time, it's mother was NOT going to come back for it any minute.
What fishy smell?
Yes, it's cramped, but it has a 5-star rear-impact safety rating.
I've always wanted a car with big tailfins.
Pull over. We're supposed to keep him rear-facing until age two.
I hate to say this, but I liked this song better on the album.
You guys feelin' sushi?
For dinner, so far we have one vote for krill.
I promised to help with his pod-cast.
Next time you'd better order an UberXL.
I still can't figure out where that smell is coming from.
Enough about my sperm count already!
It wasn't me either.
So don't you want to hear about the one that got away?
Costco sure has some great deals, huh?
I am not trying to back out. It's just that when you said that you wanted to save the whales I thought it was more of a financial proposition.
Well, that's the last time we go on vacation to Nantucket.
Honey, did you forget to pack the krill?
The check engine light is on again.
This Save the Whales thing is a lot harder than it's made out to be.
I picked him up hitchhiking outside the Sea World parking lot.
No honey..... I said pick me up with the HATCHback.
If I stop saying the word sperm, can we keep him?
I am not cleaning it. Or the car.
My mistake. I told Siri to reserve us a hatchback.
Would you please quit nagging - it's always Jonah, Jonah, Jonah...
When I said our car was too small to carry a whale in the back seat I was only joking about your mother. Your family takes things so literally.
See? You couldn't do this in a Tesla.
I know, I know, but look at what we saved!
What a fluke!
Fine, I'll talk about it.
I said it was a deal for a whale, not a whale of deal
Is the car fishtailing?
Once I accepted the ride request I had to take him, or it would have killed my driver rating.
Are you sure Costco sells krill?
The next time you get a whale of a deal talk to me first.
I couldn't leave him stranded.
I'm told it's a perfectly acceptable housewarming gift in Japan.
You used to like Moby when we were dating.
I've been driving the speed limit, but someone's been riding my tail since we left San Diego.
Don't look at me, you chose Uber Pool.
He was blubbering so badly I just had to give him a lift.
Your Tinder said whale of a time! Not time with whale!
I just couldn't put her in a kennel.
I get "Save THE whales" but "Save THIS whale" is a bit much.
did you remember to fill the pool?
Hey, it's only a metaphor.
I'm going to speed up and try to lose this tail.
Hatchback, humpback, tomato, tomatoe...
Well, the price was right. Willy was free.
If this doesn't clear out our plankton problem, then I promise to clean the pool.
Wait 'til you hear him sing.
I'm just saying, if he can afford that much sushi, he can afford the cab fare home!
It's a natural, biodegradable fuel source. What the hell is the problem?
Listen honey, I’m sorry. I could have sworn I heard the salesman say the car had a hatchback.
Is it still true that objects in the mirror are closer than they appear?
It'll be good to see the hot tub used again.
You were the one who didn't want kids.
He was a rescue whale from from a recent deserted island cartoon.
The sign only said it was illegal to take live SHELLS from the beach.
Who knew Costco had sushi!
Anyone need food or water?
Let's see them try to keep me out of the carpool lane now
I think I prefer the elephant in the room.
We shouldn't have waited so many years to throw it back in the ocean.
Do you know another song?
Stop calling me Ishmael.
I couldn't just leave him; he didn't have a ride home.
You're sure he said he wanted to spend Labor Day in the Hamptons?
Well it's not as bad as the elephant in the room
Your profile said that you liked pets!
Looks like he's moving in for the krill.
I think it's time to change the air freshener.
I could swear I told the salesman I wanted a hatchback!!
Really honey, it's just a fluke.
You got extra tartar sauce, right?
Fine, I'll admit it. We're lost.
Finally, I’m able to drive a car with tail fins.
Next time TELL me what you want for your birthday!!!!!!!!!!
You just don't see whales hitching anymore. I had to stop.
One of you is going to have to get out and push.
Now they will have to believe me.
To be honest, this isn't the sort of 'whale watching' I had in mind.
Did you hear that crap about baleen whales stalking Japanese cars?
We are going to RULE the HOV lane!
You knew what you were getting into when you married a marine biologist.
And for your information, I do not "jump into things".
"It's time to take him back to the school".
If you wanted help sleeping you could have just bought that whale sounds CD.
I know a sushi chef who might be interested.
I told you I had a big dick
Then roll up your window! The point is, we won't have to go back to Costco for three weeks!
A "whale of a good time" isn't nearly as fun as it sounds.
He would have fit in the 5-series.
If you ask one more time, 'How much longer to the ocean?' I'm turning this car around.
This. This, Gwen, is why I wanted an SUV.
C'mon, he was my best friend in college. I can't leave him out to dry!
No, YOU get him to fasten his seat belt.
Do you think we should just get a "Save the Whales" bumper sticker instead?
Last whale I'm helping you save!
This IS how I save the whales.
I just don't understand why we can't serve Chilean sea bass like everyone else.
So now we have an elephant in the room, AND a whale in the back seat.
Wake up honey, I just went through a big puddle.
I'll admit, when the salesman said it had a Humpback Seat, I had something completely different in mind.
Climate change.
Now we can use the HOV lane.
Does this mean I have to call YOU Ishmael?
The way he wiggled his tail at me... I just couldn't say "no".
The humpback is much more eco-friendly than the hatchback.
It seems like we always end up with leftovers when we eat at Ahabs'.
Actually they're mammals, not fish.
I asked for a 'hatchback' but they heard 'humpback.'
Its too little throw it back. Its too big throw it back. Nothing ever pleases you does it.
Oh, you said 'hatchback.'
Please. Call me Ishmael.
But you said you wanted a car with fins.
The problem with having a truck is everyone calls you when they need help migrating.
The portions are good, but they never give you enough tartar sauce.
How much Wasabi do you think we'll need?
He feeds on plankton. Your goldfish will be fine.
The salesman assured me the car had no flood damage.
I can’t rescue every whale … but I made a difference to this one.
C'mon, you saw the way she looked at me.
After this, I promise. No more hitchhikers.
Do the kids ALWAYS have to get what they want?
I'm not sure that he'll be better off at the lake than he was at Sea World.
Station wagon? I thought you said cetacean wagon!
I asked for a hatchback, not a Humpback
What low-frequency noise?
I cant understand why this car keeps fishtailing?
and ...... it's full of omega 3
The rental car guy gave me a great deal on the echolocation navigation package.
Why is this guy tailing me?
Please---no more spouting off in the car.
Sorry, we stopped for krill an hour ago.
Next time let's just go trout fishing.
What makes you think I don't know what I'm doing?
Well to be fair, you did bring back a lot of seashells.
He's tailgating us, I swear.
How are we on krill?
You just had to prove that you can "speak whale."
I’ve had enough of his singing.
Well, it's too late to throw him back now!
It seems our 'Whale On Board' sticker has made zero difference.
Let's see if he likes the car wash better.
Think of it as saving them one whale at a time.
Yes ,I have heard of catch and release, why.
I know, I know....and stop calling me Ishmael
As if the 600 pound gorilla in our living room wasn't bad enough.
So is this a hybrid?
It's a carpool.
What does woooowwooeeeeewonnmmmwwwaaarrmmmoooeeee mean?
No! I was not talking about your mother. We literally have a whale riding us.
Okay, Okay..I didn't realize it said "come have a whale FOR a time"
we should have let this one get away
Oh, come on! We stopped for krill not more than 5 minutes ago.
We should only buy fish at Costco if we are having company.
Before we address the elephant in the room, there's something more pressing I've been meaning to talk to you about.
This way we don't have to carpool with Larry.
What did you think I meant by carpooling?
... whale kabobs, whale creole, whale gumbo, pan-fried, deep-fried, pineapple whale ....
I swear, the ad said it was a hatch-back.
We're not getting anywhere near the gas mileage the dealership promised.
I said on my profile that my memoir would read like "On the Road" meets "Moby-Dick." I feel like I was pretty clear.
Don't look at me like that. You said you wanted a 'rescue'!
Maybe we should have gotten a cat.
Well, you brought home that stray kitten last week
After this one I promise, I'll go vegan
It's our first date. We should be talking more about YOUR interests.
You know, I still think you should have just gotten a t-shirt.
It's my new echolocation system. My GPS is on the fritz.
We usually don't pick up hitch hikers, but you don't seem like a killer.
Sorry for the odor, ma'am, but due to budget cuts Greenpeace will be using UberPool for whale relocations.
You left plankton in the trunk again, didn't you.?!
Well, now's a hell of a time to find out you're allergic.
Look, it's Uber. And no, I don't have to explain.
Well, which is it--are we not picking up hitchhikers, or are we saving the whales?
No, honey, I called the whale BEHIND us a blubber-ass!
O.K., have it your way. You heard a humpback whale sing.
Is this not what you meant when you said you wanted to hump back at my place?
I'm finished with your 'save the whales' crusade.
Do you think we are being too literal in response to Save The Whale?
Honey, just learn to live with it. You know, like I do with your Mother.
I don't even notice the krill odor anymore.
I told him he could be anything he wanted to be, how'd I know he'd say whale?
I'd feel better if we had a humpback seat.
OK, what we can't get in the fridge we'll give to your Aunt Sally
I had to bring it home. If I tell them it was "THIS BIG" they'd just laugh at me.
Really, Margaret, do you have to save everything?
Doesn't your friend know any other kinds of songs?
I don't think so. If we had a bigger car, you'd want to rescue its mother.
Start looking for a pet friendly rest area. We should let him out to spout.
He did call shotgun first.
It IS cheaper than buying it by the ounce!
What if the cat doesn't like whale meat?
I wasn't aware that saving the whales included gas and tolls.
Now I can write the great American novel
He prefers Moby Richard.
Every year we tell your mother that we don't want any more holiday whales, and yet...
It's no different from picking up your Mom, only a lot more quiet.
he wanted a lift to the nearest whaleway station
You know how the rearview mirror says, "Objects are closer than they appear." Well...
I feel that there's something you are not telling me.
Do you think Petco carries krill?
Stop being such a Moby Dick.
It's a hell of a lot better than the elephant in the room.
It's ok to pick up hitchers if they're endangered.
We gotta get a new ride-share app.
No problem. There's a backup camera.
Will you two stop blubbering up there?
It's a 2016 Ford Flounder
Okay, I admit it--we may be a little lost.
If I hear that song one more time I'll go nuts.
Well the wedding invitation DID say "something blue" !!!
but think of how much we saved by buying in bulk!
Stop saying "you're gonna need a bigger car!"
There are times, Honey, when Catch and Release ceases to be an option.
I told Jonah we'd pick him up.
So we're agreed: The New Yorker has been having too many whale cartoons.
Do you think we can use the HOV lane?
Do you smell something?
Trust me, if it gets carsick we're rich.
I still won't buy a minivan.
He said it was only a few leagues.
What does the doctor plan to do with the sperm sample?
Do the tail fins look too ostentatious?
Is his seat belt buckled ?
It runs on gasoline, electricity, or whale oil.
The odor will go away - but we'll have a great fish story forever.
It's a '67 Barracuda, why?
I still think it's important we both show up for his first day back to school.
So, just one time I pick up a hitchhiker, and you're gonna give me that look the rest of the trip?
How are we fixed for tartar sauce?
See, this is exactly why we need a convertible!
Are you getting any air back there?
This is the worst drawing I've ever been in
Next time you buy a car on line, try asking if it's ever been under water.
It's my emotional support whale
I think we just hit something!
One vote for Italian and one for plankton. So it's up to me.
At least you won't kill this one by overfeeding it.
I think your beach combing is getting out of hand.
We may need to rethink our bumper stickers.
Trust me, he's much better off with us than at Seaworld.
I guess the backup camera wasn't working.
Dont worry, all these new cars come with Sonar
...And it has a ton of tail-room.
If you don't quit your blubbering, I will turn this car around.
I had something else in mind when you signed up to adopt a whale.
I think he doesn't fully understands the concept of car pools.
I get the sense you're having second thoughts about getting me that 3-D printer.
I caught it. You fillet it.
You're quiet . . . Still thinking about the one that got away?
Why do you say this is your worst first date?
Beats me where I got him. I took Ambien last night.
Well I think it's OK to be a sperm donor
Hatchback, humpback - you do mumble a lot, honey.
Okay, okay. So I meant to write “hatchback,” not “humpback.” But you’ve got to admit, the rental car agency was *extremely* accommodating!
It'd just be nice if he offered to chip in for gas is all I'm saying.
At least I get to drive in the HOV lane.
Getting a hybrid wasn't enough for you?
You said you didn't want children,
I just need to make a quick stop at the krill store.
Next time you might want to opt for the uberXL
Now what?
You couldn't have just joined "Save the Monarch Butterfly", eh?
He knew it was just for the summer.
How was school?
Hatchback, humpback, what's the difference?
I thought the new tires were supposed to prevent fishtailing.
I swear I don't know how that sperm got on the back seat.
I thought the whale noises would be soothing.
Why doesn't he just go around.
That's enough car pooling.
At least it is not an elephant and it is not in our living room
Why don't you just get a dog, like everyone else?
Yes, I got a cetacean for speeding.
While you were napping we barely made it through a flash flood.
We'll need a bigger booster seat soon.
I was very clear in my profile that I live and breath marine biology.
Well I wasn't going to make him swim home!
Why is it always about what you want?
You're gonna need a bigger car.
This is the one that ate my dad. I'm sure of it this time.
At least he's not complaining about leg room.
All right, have it your way - you heard a whale sing.
Perhaps we should have just gone with our instincts and gotten the kids that puppy.
It's a Sicilian message ...
I don't want to hear about the one that got away...
Oh, I thought you said lets burn some blubber!
I think it's time to remove the booster seat.
You were in the same bad mood when the kids brought home goldfish.
HOV lane, we all work at the aquarium. It's a win-win.
There is no catch.
You said you wanted a pet that didn't shed.
I know what you're thinking, but the carpool lane is actually faster than the Gulf Stream this time of day.
Do you hear something ambient?
They were out of the hatchbacks so I got a humpback.
Ok if the echo location app doesn't work, then we can stop and ask for directions.
And twelve gallons of cocktail sauce...
You're the one who insisted on a hybrid!
Need me to scoot my seat forward?
We don't usually pick up hitchhikers, but we figure you've got quite a tale.
You should have said it was caviar you wanted. How was I to know there are two kinds of Beluga?
Really? Of ALL the possible interpretations of "Save the Whales", that was the ONLY one that resonated with you?
It's like I always say: teach a man to fish and you feed him for life.
I'm so over car-sharing.
For a first date, I think this is going rather well.
You never like what I buy at Costco.
Goodbye hatchback, hello humpback.
Let's talk about the whale in the car.
Think the guys will believe me now ?
I told you this would happen if your mother didn't go on a diet!
They shouldn't ding us for normal wear and tear.
Why does he always want to go to the beach.
Okay, maybe I do go a little crazy when I shop at Costco.
I told you, Google Maps said this is the fastest route.
If anyone asks tell them it's local.
Don't call me Ishmael.
You know, we'll have to check with the rabbi to see if it's kosher.
I distinctly remember telling you that it was a whale of a deal.
I get it, "catch and release," but first I've just got to show this one to the guys.
I don't smell anything.
Is it just me, or does a full tank of gas not go as far as it used to?
Next rest area, it's your turn!
But the guys would never believe me.
You have to admit, Carol, he makes our car pool a fabulous pun.
I'm beginning to think global warming is a problem
I thought we'd make a donation to a sperm bank today.
Sure looked cute in the rescue center pool.
Remind me to pick up one of those pine tree thingies.
This is far forward as my seat will go. Stop blubbering.
As soon as we drop this last Uber passenger off, I promise we can start date night!
Your profile didn't mention dependants
I'm so tired of trying to impress you.
Well, I guess we better talk about the elephant in the room...
I thought we were picking up your sister.
We need a carpool.
I know. Don't pick up hitchhikers. But this is a whole lot of omega 3.
I think you should sit in the back with her in case she gets nervous.
I'm second-guessing this whole car pool thing.
What's the big deal? Only you can sing in the car?
I was lucky to fit his bike in the trunk
You said no cats
Did I hit him? Did you hear a thump? Oh, God, I think I hit him!
... casseroles, grilled steaks, seafood salads, soups and stews, not to mention sushi...and possibly lamp oil and handbags...even corsets and hats, maybe.
Ok, the next time I order a hatchback on ZipCar, I'll check for auto-corrects.
I thought the salesman said, "Whale of a car," not whale in a car.
This gives new meaning to a whale watch.
Remember, tell your mother to keep the cat in the basement.
So glad you opted for the hybrid...
Well.. you were the one who wanted to go whale watching!
'Don't worry,' you said. 'The car is big enough,' you said. 'We don't need to pay for delivery,' you said.
What's he blubbering about in the back seat?
I said backseat "thrill" seeking, not "krill" seeking.
The breeder assured me it's great with kids.
This is the last time I agree to take the leftovers at your family's Inuit Thanksgiving
Do I lead with 'You won't believe this fish story' or 'I've got a whale of a tale to tell you'?
The difference is Seaworld keeps whales in captivity, while I'm just an enthusiast.
I think your definition of catch and release is too narrow.
Time to give up beach-combing, Barb.
The Hudson or the East?
Looks like somebody can’t start the migration fast enough.
I heard new orca as new yorker!
I asked the dealer to throw in some Beluga, but I meant the caviar
So now you're gonna tell me about the one that got away?
So, what's with all the whales in New Yorker cartoons these days?
Imagine what would happen if it said, "Save The Planet."
Did I tell you about the one that didn't get away?
Uh-oh, we have a whale-gater.
If you say "We should have went with the Shit-zu" one more time...
This hybrid gets 40 nautical miles per gallon.
Next time, let's go with something other than Sea Mist on the air freshener.
Sad eyes; right. Now we have to house train him.
Thanks for calling shotgun.
Anything happen while I dozed off just then?
I hope you don't mind but I need to drop someone off at the marina first.
Look, it was just lying there on the beach, and you're always saying we should get a pet.
Can we please Free Willy ?
You mind if we stop at the next service station? I need to spray my blowhole.
"He's a pilot whale which is ten times better than our GPS".
I have some bad news about what happened while you were asleep.
You read the bumper sticker, right?
The whale tank clearly said 'you touch it you buy it.'
Turns out I was bidding on the wrong eBay.
Greg had to admit the word 'carpool' might be misleading to some species.
How about switching to 'Save the Chihuahuas' ?
Everything has to be over-the-top for you, doesn't it?
I know it's unusual for a first date.
Okay...Okay.... But YOU said, "it has to be wild caught!"
Well the vet doesn't do housecalls
I had hoped there was a cash alternative to the grand prize. I was wrong and I'm sorry.
Because you had too much to drink, that's why.
This car fishtails more than most.
It still beats having a pot-bellied pig.
No, I still don't want a minivan.
A dog would have been easier.
Next time, I buy the bait.
...And you think they''ll believe THIS story?
SONAR comes standard.
You never like my ideas.
The '57s had bigger fins.
You understand "adopt" is just a metaphor, right?
You think the new save the whales bumper sticker is a bit much?
All I'm saying is you could've sponsored a koala instead
I feel like seafood tonight.
OK, OK. You were right. Ocean Mist is a little too rich. We'll go with the Fresh Pine scent next time.
Tell me the truth. What did we take at the party?
Tonight I think you should call me Ishmael.
Become an Uber driver you said, it will be easy you said.
Even the Johnson's have a coy pond, I wanted something different.
Okay, okay, but, who else would've given him a ride?
Do you know a good bar and krill?
You said we could get a pet
You never said the word 'inflatable'.
You must admit the sounds are calming when we’re gridlocked
I'm telling you he's right on my tail.
We've drove off a bridge. We're trapped in our car underwater. What else can go wrong?
I thought you told me size doesn't matter.
Mammal.
The mechanic's explanation for why we have a sagging rear end seems a little fishy to me.
So we agree to disagree?
We met on a desert island.
I really think she meant "Kale." And we forgot milk.
I still think a dog would have been easier
I think that bumper stickers should be taken literally.
What elephant in the room?
Why did we bother saving this whale if we're never going to use it?
I think your "Save the Whales" sentiment has gone too far!
Well, something's clicking.
Okay, okay, but it's not every week there's a closeout sale at Sea World.
Look - I needed a third rider for the express lane, OK?
Just how far under water is our mortgage?
I don't think you realize we're under water.
Shotgun? Dream on Moby...
Moby is as much a part of this family as you or I!
I told you he had his fin up and was looking for a ride.
I'm not saying I'm against picking up hitchhikers. I'm just saying that sometimes it's a judgement call.
Don't you think he's gotten big enough to get to school on his own?
Well, I had to give him a lift, I felt sorry for him, he was blubbering.
This is the last time we pickup hitchhikers to the aquarium.
Whalegater!
We've got to find a vet who makes house calls.
Guys, is there any plankton in my teeth?
Like I said, it's a free Willy.
I'm getting terrible gas mileage.
He may be a baby but I don't think we will need the booster seat any longer.
I couldn't help it, the look on his face, he wanted to come home with us.
well, at least somebody will use the pool now.....
THIS ISN'T WHAT I THOUGHT WHEN YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO SAVE SPERM
No, it appears I don't know what 'carpool' actually means.
Well if this isn't one whale of a hump day...
I don't know what made me think of this but did you say that your mother is staying with us this weekend?
if you clean it; I'll cook it
They had sea horses, angle fish, and goldfish, but no, he's so cute honey let's get the whale.
So tell me about the one that got away.
We're gonna need a bigger tank.
Can we talk about the whale in the car?
This is the worst Uber Pool of my life.
It just feels like you're always annoyed about something.
Well sor-ry! Not every methane-powered car is going to be exactly what you want!
"It's cheaper to buy bulk....".
Do we have freezer bags?
We're goin' to need a bigger fish tank.
You thought I said hatchback?
OK, ok. I should have spent the extra 5 bucks to have it filleted..
Look, the ocean's not far away and he had a winning smile.
Oh, stop complaining - you got shotgun and he's paying for his third of the gas.
It'll look good over the fireplace.
You know what this means, don't you? Whale salad sandwiches for months!
When they asked us to feed their fish for a few days...
It will be company for the elephant in the room.
That was one helluva pothole.
Don't you miss that new leather smell?
So is this your first uberpool?
I know, but $3.95 a pound is hard to pass up.
I told you I was giving up deer hunting.
Now don't you wish we got the minivan?
How can we pass this off as road kill?
Are you sure this is how Pokemon Go is supposed to work?
Next time we get a sitter.
I promised you a 'Whale of a Good Time' and I mean to deliver!
I've got it all figured out. The kids get the pool on the odd days.
It's part of his 10-point migration plan.
Does this make it legal to drive in the HOV lane now?
You know I always wanted to do my part to save the whales.
What did you expect when you married someone named Ahab?
The next time someone asks you heads or tails, choose one or the other.
She's right. She did say "shotgun."
Do you have a breath mint?
Wouldn't the guys have taken your word for it?
Your profile said you liked Moby.
ok that's not what really happened.
It's about the elephant in the room, isn't it?
Well, you wanted Seafood!
It's a vegetarian, we're vegetarians. What's your problem?
I do hope you're not going to start blubbering again.
You tell him we're not going out for krill again.
I told you he'd outgrow the aquarium.
Well, we've finally dealt with "the elephant in the room." What shall we tackle next?
I'm just glad we didn't opt for 4 whale drive. This is more than enough!
The kids nagging about not having enough fish for their aquarium ends today.
I hate backseat metaphors.
Who'll tell the kids they can't use the swimming pool?
Let's see little Johnny get out of his car seat now.
Is it bigger than it appears or closer than it appears? Either way, we're screwed.
What? He was stranded and needed a ride.
Low sperm count? No problem.
You always said you wanted to adopt a rescue.
Honey Bun, have you put on a few lbs? I 've got it floored and I can't get over 20 mph .
It wouldn't fit in the cooler. It wouldn't even fit in the trunk. What else was I supposed to do?
What do you mean did I shower this morning?
And what if I told you he is already fully-grown?
Perhaps you'd prefer a ride-sharing service that discriminates?
I swear I told the dealership hatchback...
Next vacation your not getting any souvenirs !
Be nice, honey. You're making him feel like a fifth whale.
I don't like the smell of plankton either, but we need to stay in the HOV lane.
He'll be a perfect mate for the elephant in the living room.
We'll tell your mother he's a rescue. She'll understand.
If we have another, you know, we'll need a minivan.
I think they're tailgating on porpoise.
Hey, you were the one that wanted fins
Next time don't bring the whole sperm just the sample.
Well, can't you find a recipe?
For once, could you spare me 'the elephant in the room' talk?
At 10 cents a pound, we couldn't pass it up.
Thank you for using Uber Tidal Pool
We can put him in the pool. We just have to clear it with the condo association.
We should of just taken a Picture!!!
You smell anything ?
He's chipping in for gas.
OK, OK, so I didn't see the 'Fish Crossing' Sign.
Did you bring his water tank?
he used to play with Bob Marley
Your plaice or mine?
"Penny for your thoughts...'
Uh oh, I think that's Greenpeace following us.
Well, you should have thought about going to the ocean before we left.
We're going to need a bigger car.
The irony here is that Captain Ahab is a third cousin on my mother's side
I knew you had a lot of baggage, but isn't this a little extreme?
For the last time, there is no one with a wooden leg living on Oak Street.
I think this guy's tailing me.
Didn't think that one all the way through, did you Ahab?
Again, BIG thanks for calling shotgun.
What's so strange about having a companion animal?
And you thought we had no reason to buy a station wagon.
Everyone has to do their part to decrease rising sea levels
Where do I begin?
YOU NEVER BELIEVE ANYTHING I TELL YOU!
Okay, before we get to the drive-up window,.... one plain Filet-O-Fish, one cod sandwich with extra tarter and a super size bucket of plankton!
It's amazing what you can find on the Craigslist "Free" want ads these days.
I specifically stated that I wanted the Porsche with the whale tail.
If he doesn't like the pool, we can take him back.
I got rid of the elephant in the room, didn't I?
I AM pressing the peddle!
One back-seat driver is enough, dear.
Some have greatness thrust upon them.
Sorry, UberPool is still working out the kinks.
It's a long story but that's right, everyone just calls me Ishmael.
I'm getting that catch-and-release thing.
It happens every time we walk into a pet store.
Don't say anything about lamp oil and we'll be fine.
I didn't know Greenpeace was going to be so literal.
We need to discuss the elephant in the room.
This is the last time we pick a rideshare at Marine Life World.
Then I guess we're going to the beach. Again.
Blue? Flipper? ... Fido?
Let's just hope we don't draw anyone's attention.
I guess we could just hang up signs and maybe someone will claim her.
'No singing in the car'
See, I told you everything would fit.
Next time you find a whale of a deal can you just walk away?
In a year, everyone will be talking about "Sea-to-Table".
OK, I promise next time I won't commit to pet-sitting without talking to you first>
You know...sometimes, winner doesn't have to take ALL.
You just had to save a whale.
How Stella Got Her Humpback
He's tailgating us.
What did the mechanic say about that wailing noise?
Well, you're the one who wanted seafood take-out.
"Jonah doesn't get out much, does he?
You buckled the kids in first, right?
Don’t tell your sister we’re not using a car seat.
You couldn't just leave it at the elephant in the room.
They won't say 'fish story' this time.
How could I possibly 'smell like krill'?
We'll just have to get a bigger bowl.
I'm happy to help, but just how big is your fish tank?
We are never going to the animal shelter again!
I thought he said "hatchback," but he must have said "humpback."
The rear airbag in this car is organic!
OK, I'll bite. Why 'Ishmael?'
Okay, so we'll need to buy a bigger bowl.
For the last time, yes, they have a pool!
I hate these "you touch it, you buy it" policies.
Well, you can remind Willy there that gas isn't free.
Well, don't give me that snide look. You're the one who said it's cheaper to buy in bulk.
so, you save whales?
"Really, you thought saying "We're gonna need a bigger car" was still funny?
One last stop at Costco for the jumbo pallet of Krill.
It's your imagination.
I know, I know...I should have kept the living room set and traded it in for Door # 2.
Well, I'm glad we got that behind us."
I will consult the GPS next time, okay?
At first I thought he was just a fluke, but then he grew on me
...and just where do you plan to save this one?
I don't love her for the shape of her body, I love her for the size of her brain.
I thought you were bringing the krill.
I told you we should have rented the full size.
Honey, I think we're being tailed.
Well, it's the one that didn't get away.
Now that you've landed a whale, they'll have to make you a Partner!
Yes! But it took them a while to work the bugs out of the Tesla too.
Why can't you just collect shells like everyone else?
I'm glad you called shotgun.
Google krill store.
Ok, I'm pretty sure this metaphor isn't working.
Five fathoms since last time you asked.
Call me idiot.
This wasn't what I had in mind when you said "Free Willy".
Look, I'm not getting rid of him. We've been through a lot together. We're survivors. You wouldn't understand; you didn't see last week's cartoon.
Did we have to bring your mother?
He gives me great traction in the snow.
This is exactly why I hate carnival games.
Watch her, I couldn't get the seatbelt to lock.
I think you are taking this "Save The Whales" thing a little too far.
What makes you think I have a Melville complex?
You shouldn't have begged me to see "Free Willy."
If you ask me that Captain Ahab fella just didn't try hard enough
Anyone else in the mood for krill?
Anchovie, my ass!
I think it's been more than three days
That reminds me...when did you say your mother was coming for a visit?
I never should have signed up for Uber.
Did you hear a thump?
So, how long have you been a sperm donor?
That was the weirdest threesome ever.
If you don't start behaving, this will be more than just a visit to SeaWorld.
Look, you're not the only one in this car who's blue.
Do you think they have plankton at Taco Bell?
I didn't know you meant "searching for your white whale" quite so literally...
I'm thinking pan grilled with lemon and red pepper.
So, what else is allowed on this Paleo diet?
Other than that, how did you enjoy the beach?
Did you feel that, I think we just fish-tailed!
Nobody likes a humpback-seat driver!
Relax, it's only until Sea World finds her a forever home.
So, I'll concede the station wagon would have had some advantages over the sedan...
Must you sing that same song the whole way?
Why don't you get a cat?
Why would I call you Ishmael?
Should we discuss the gigantic whale in the car?
Plankton is in now, and he knows a good spot!
What happened to wanting a rescue dog?
This certainly tops anything else we've done in the back seat.
Why can't you just be glad that I picked up the right whale and not the killer whale?
You're the one who said he'd grow on us.
Next time you might consider Uber XXL, pal.
Next time they say "You'll have a whale of time," let's pass.
They were all out of goldfish.
Can we talk about the 100 ton Cetacean in the room...?
If you didn't want an Uber Pool, you shouldn't have selected it.
Did you feel a hump?
So there I was on this desert island, standing next to a palm tree...
Why don't we just acknowledge 200 ton whale in the car?
I mean, everyone collects seashells at the beach...that's the obvious choice.
I think one of the taillights is out.
Now will you believe my fish story?
Yes, but there are a lot fewer stops than with the old carpool.
He keeps saying, "This is all so Kafkaesque."
He was stranded on the beach. So we pick him up and take him to the nearest marine park. They'll fix him up and release him back into the wild. What's the worst that can happen? It's not like he's some bison from Yellowstone.
Honey, wake up. You'll never guess what's trying to pass us!
I know a good bar and krill.
It's the Herman Melville Limited Edition.
My arms aren't that wide and besides, who'd believe me?
Are we there yet?
Car dealers. 'Seats five comfortably,' my ass.
It's a hybrid.
It really does improve the handling
Did it even occur to you that maybe it isn't my sperm motility that's the problem?
That's the last time I take my kleptomaniac girlfriend to SeaWorld.
I swear to God one more peep out of you and I'll turn this car around, there'll be no SeaWorld today!
So you think we should have picked the other one?
I agree, dear. This would never have worked with Uber.
He was hitchhiking near SeaWorld.
I guess that's the problem when you combine Apple Maps with a self-driving car.
I told you picking up Jonah was a bad idea.
Did you bring some water?
I support mass transit.
I know this ride blows.
I prefer the old horn sound.
Oh, my God! Where's Jonah?
Fine. Next time we just get the capsules.
Okay, but I still caught two to your one.
Nobody likes a back seat diver, Frank
No one will believe I caught it on a fly rod.
Sushi again?
I love surprising your parents!
I knew we should'be gone to Scotland, not Wales
This is the last time we do errands for Andrew.
Call the kids and tell them to turn off the pool heater.....
He said he's from whales, and just wants a lift to the next Brexit.
You should see the one I threw back!
I don't care what your friends say. He's too big to be rear-facing.
At Thanksgiving, maybe my uncle won't run on about his latest deer hunt.
I thought you said you wanted to see Wales!
Did I mention that my name is "Ishmael."
I thought you said no more rescue animals
He's neutered.
But I followed the one souvenir limit.
Honey, it appears that someone's tailing us.
We need to talk about the elephant in the room.
Uber says I can't discriminate against animals.
Something seems a little fishy.
You used to love sushi.
You wanted a compact.
Buckle up or we're not going to Sea World.
Picture, schmicture. I'm showing the guys.
Are you sure that's how it happened? Because to be honest something smells a little fishy...
You were right, we have a tail.
I'm not taking this too far, and I promise this is the last thing I buy for the aquarium.
Do I tell you how to swim?
You never know with these rescues, but the guy promised he wouldn't get any bigger.
So, whose sperm count is low?
Yeah it was a great night, I just think Jonah's wedding favors were a little overkill.
I'm just saying, your last three fish have all died. Perhaps you're just not ready for a pet.
For our next kid, we're using a sperm bank.
So is this your first time taking UberPool?
I think it's time I told you "Joe" is a nickname. My real name is Jonah.
At least HE's not pressing an imaginary brake pedal every few minutes.
So, what was wrong with just adopting a dog?
I can't believe he's car sick.
Just think of the traction when it snows!
I just read 'My Porpoise Driven Life'
that's not the spot to sit if he gets carsick...
I'll tell you what's endangered, young man. Your TV privileges. That's what.
Are you sure baking soda will get the smell out?
Why would we need to talk about an "elephant in the living room"?
Okay, share cars aren't always immaculate.
Let him enjoy his songs.
I know the sounds of the ocean help you sleep, but this is ridiculous
This wasn't what I was expecting when you said " I want to save the whales! "
Well which is it, a fluke or a whale of a tale?
I said "why don't you take the wheel."
This is not my idea of a Car Pool.
You're the worst humpback-seat driver I've ever met.
I think there is something in my blind spot.
Think he's outgrown the car seat?
There's plenty of fish in the seat.
Is this the equivalent of an elephant in the room?
For the 100th time, YES, I had a good time at the party, but just a good time.
It’s either buy a Suburban or tell him he’s adopted.
I said HATCH back.
I'm thinking fish for dinner tonight.
Look, at that price Sea World was practically giving him away. Besides, we'll make it back on the caviar.
But we agreed that this was the only way to save Jonah
'If I hear, 'Are we there yet?' one more time,.... I'm gonna stop the car and harpoon that thing!"
Define "a whale of a good time".
When he stuck out his fluke, I couldn't resist picking him up.
Sperm whale donor, Honey. We know he's a good swimmer!
I don't know whether this new carpooling lane is worth the trouble
That's the third drive-thru in a row and still no krill. Today's not your day, Murray.
Do we have to take your mother with us everywhere?
Another Tailgater.
At the time teaching him how to live outside his tank and giving him room to grow seemed like a good idea.
What's that smell?
I know you don't understand, but we were stranded on an island together a couple of weeks ago, so we're like brothers now.
Because I like the smell of the ocean, okay?
I read that echolocation is the new GPS.
So, we have to buy a bigger fish tank. Big deal.
Call me Lyftmael.
We're the first on our block to own a humpback hatchback.
You can tell Captain Sonar I know the way from here.
I feel like our relationship has alot of dead weight
Looks like I get to buy that big new grill!
Uber doesn't play favorites.
What? You said I could get one thing from the gift shop.
They aren't the tailfins I had in mind, but I like them.
He says he lost his pilot fish.
And at home its 'the elephant in the room' you won't discuss!
You wouldn't let me have a dog.
I don't see why we can't take him with us once in awhile. We're a family, dammit!
It's just for the weekend.
Seriously Edna, there's nothing back there
Well what's wrong with calling him "Ishmael"?
When I was talking about bringing a whale home, I was talking about your mother.
Yes I'm sure there will be leftovers.
Next time let's use a different car-pool app.
"I think he wants us to pull over".
It will make a change from tilapia.
"I told you when we met that I was super serious about saving them.
Now, that was a true all-you-can-eat seafood buffet.
When they offered a whale of a deal in a used car, this isn't what I expected.
Maybe we should rethink sushi night.
Honey, see if there's any of that krill left in the glove box.
I am not avoiding the elephant in the room.
Can we tone down the nonverbal communication?
It creates more downforce and therefore provides better traction. Why do you ask?
No, I said humpback, not hatchback.
Just drop me off at 19.896` N and 155.582`W.
If you say "whale of a tale" one more time........
Well, you could stand to lose a few pounds yourself!
Whales must be really easy for cartoonists to draw.
We should have rented at least a mid-size.
Is this what you meant by whale watching?
I can't wait until he's old enough to drive himself.
Look on the bright side: we can use the HOV lane the whole way home.
So where the hell am I supposed to get 100 kilos of plankton?
Did you remember to pack his squeakie toys and the karaoke machine? We can't expect your mom to entertain him ALL week while we're gone.
We can't go--she hasn't fastened her seat belt yet.
" Well , at least we know my sperm count isn't the issue " .
I'm starting to think you were right that we should have just had kids.
Where am I going to get 5 million pounds of plankton?
Perhaps we should re-consider our position on hitch hikers
YOU tell him he has krill breath!
Read the fine print before clicking Submit.
And you said we'd have a whale of a time...
You just HAD to have a souvenir.
His singing soothes me in traffic, OK?
You're right, I think we do need a new air freshener.
No, I said this car was echo friendly.
For sushi takeout you can't beat the serving size.
If you ask me, a whale in the back seat is a heck of a lot worse than an elephant in the room.
We did what you wanted to do last weekend.
You really can't beat the warehouse store prices, even if you're getting a little more than you need.
You distinctly said, "Show me a whale of a good time."
I can't wait to see that show off try to filet this.
It is not unprecedented. Someone took a young bison from a national park just last summer.
Your turn to clean the catch.
Any objections to having it mounted?
You kids quit crying back there!
You tell him it's time he found his own way to the coast off Baja
Objects in the mirror are not just closer than they appear.
I think you're right, we should've stuck with the calamari.
He'll cheer up once he sees there's plankton for dinner.
I thought you brought the krill.
Let's just keep driving. Maybe we will find some roadkrill.
Is it me, or has the smell of krill followed us all the way from Montauk?
Do you think he'll miss the ocean as much as we do?
Do you get the feeling that they might have put a tail on us?
seal level rise is worse then I thought
If there's one thing I can't stand, it's whalegating
He wants krill? We could stop at Whole Foods.
No, honestly, it followed me to the car.
Next time we get pulled over, let me do the talking, ok?
I told you we should have gotten the cetacean wagon.
I know honey, but the doc said I had to do things to increase my sperm count!
You wanted a car with fins on the back, right?
This car won't stop fish tailing
Really, no chips?
I thought you said we need to eat less meat?
I told you I was dedicated to Greenpeace when we met.
I assumed it was ok since your profile said you like pets.
I still say your Uncle Ahab would have liked a gift card better.
Your always bothered by little things.
I'm telling you Jonah, I think we have this thing backwards.
Well, call me Ishmael.
I promise, it's just for one night.
Your sure the whale sounds CD isn't enough to get you to sleep?
Is that Greenpeace following us?
I think Whole Foods probably knows what it's doing.
I thought I was buying a hatchback.
I think it's time we talked about the blue whale in the car.
We can't just give our son a goldfish. His fifth birthday is too important.
Don"t you long for the days when the only thing in your tank was a tiger?
What a back sea driver.
Something's fishy around here.
On the phone, you said you didn't mind sharing your Uber ride.
Ever since I put on that bumper sticker that says 'Honk if You Love Krill', this has been happening.
I know you're skeptical, but trust me. The kids are going to love it.
He's not quite as majestic above water.
No, we're not at the beach yet!
Does your radio get any lower frequencies?
I will never, ever drive a minivan.
I never thought we'd be watching him for this long.
Now I just need to stop by the store for 10,000 pounds of krill.
This should be enough blubber to last us through the Trump administration.
What are we going to say we used for bait?
I am giving him a lift just to school
No to the tender strains of the humpback mating call? Ok then, would dinner and a movie put you in the mood?
How far ya migratin', stranger?
So much for the small pond theory.
We really need a backup camera.
Fine, go ahead and blame it on autocorrect, but how was I supposed to know that you meant "hatchback?"
I told you to rent a "hatchback".
I spy with my little eye....
I don't mind him tailing us. I just hope he doesn't breach.
Clearly we don't agree on what a "whale of a time" means.
You said if I caught a big one, you'd clean it!
This model is available with hatchback or humpback.
Honey, did you remember the chips?
I feel like we've forgotten something. Did you turn off the oven?
Right Ralph. You got another whale of a deal.
No one is going to believe us, so let's keep it a secret.
If it's sushi grade, we're set for life.
Right whale, white male; what's the difference? We're both endangered.
Wouldn't it be easier to download humpback whale songs?
Should we poach it or grill it?
He insisted I take him out for some sushi.
I know it's misleading, but the Shell station does not sell krill.
He's decided to take a 'gap year' between the Atlantic and the Pacific.
We're gonna need a bigger aquarium.
'Humpback.' 'Hatchback.' You can see where I got confused.
Believe me, it's HUGE!
It's closer than you think.
I'm pretty sure he wasn't drowning. You didn't need to "rescue" him
Okay! they got me,the seafood platter for life raffle sounded to good pass up.
I promise you, this will not turn out like our teacup pig fiasco.
Thing is, that new fish smell that everyone loves, just doesn't last.
When a car salesman says it's a "Whale of a Deal," don't assume he's speaking figuratively.
Oh. A 'Save the Whales' bumper sticker. Yeah, I didn't get that.
Should have got the mid-sized.
Im telling you, it's not going to fit in the bowl.
I think your Mother will be surprised with her gift.
It's a keeper
Want to listen to Moby?
I have crabs.
Google "how to filet a whale."
He's reading "On The Road."
Yes...He actually DID call shotgun.
It really was a hell of a storm surge.
Please don't give me the "we're about to be swallowed by a whale" routine again.
Does the car seem sluggish to you?
I think we need to buy a bigger grill.
So I said to him, "call me, Ishmael. We have Bluetooth now."
Our problem wasn't bringing a whale to the party. We just shouldn't have brought a blue whale.
Again? You have the bladder of a humpback.
I meant the comparison as a compliment honey.
He's right. Shotgun controls the radio.
I don't know about you, but I had a whale of a good time.
OK, I will now concede that it is NOT a goldfish.
You'll be singing a different tune once she coughs up the ambergris.
I think we're gonna need a bigger fish tank.
Nobody would believe me otherwise.
Let me tell you about the one that got away!
It must be low tide.
If we don't find his owner, I think we should keep him.
We'll figure it out when we get home.
I was thinking maybe we could go to the beach this weekend.
No, dear, I will not call you Ishmael.
Do you smell krill?
I think you are taking this whole “save the whales” thing a little too far.
Seriously? Another whale cartoon?
Like you could get us there without fishtailing.
I was just lying there, on my little island . . .
Bob Mankoff has a thing about whales, that's why.
How expensive is krill?
What could I do? He asked for sanctuary.
Remember when you said you wanted fish for dinner?
I feel like there is an elephant in the room and it smells fishy.
How can you be bored again?
Did I tell you about the one that got away?
I wish I'd been alive in the 1950s when fins were in.
I know it smells, but think how long it will be before we have to buy cat food again.
I like to listen to Moby in the car
I mean, why have a convertible if you're not going to use it?
Honey. Wake up your dreams are becoming reality again.
Yes, Bob, I am aware you have a backbone, but I need you to slide down a bit further.
He can blow that thing all day long...where am I supposed to go?
Yes, I thought saving them was important, but that was before I realized how much I'd enjoy the bragging rights.
I thought you were a "catch and release" fisherman.
Wait... have you seen the dog?
Does it feel like it handles better to you?
Wake up. We're being tailed.
I still think it was too soon to switch to a forward facing car seat.
There's something besides the elephant in the room that we're failing to address.
Carpool is a misnomer!
Okay, maybe the Adopt -a- Whale rally wasn't such a good idea."
Mom said it would be just for a few days.
We're picking up the next one in Noah's car.
What're you guys talking about?
Just think, you won't have to stress over meal planning for weeks.
I'm starting to wonder if our car can support our lifestyle.
Did I ever tell you that I was a Marine Biologist?
Do you think its about time we talk about the blue whale in the car?
Do you trust me now? I really do go fishing.
I told you not to follow Apple Maps.
Are you sure about this, hon? Think about the vet bills?
I said put moby on the radio
I guess you didn't quite check my whole profile...
I think we got the whale sighting thing down.
How's the air back there?
I told the salesperson I would only buy the car if I got a whale of a deal.
I thought he said HATCHback.
Should we talk about the elephant in the room?
They say this Melville recorded book has unusual special effects.
Save the whales sounds so stellar. Now what?
Did you get a look at that kid at the take-out window?? What? Like no one's ever ordered plankton before?
Let's face it, the krill is gone!!
Next time we'll take the ferry.
Anyone can go whale watching.
He's afraid he's becoming an imposition.
Getting him in here was a total fluke.
I wish that blowhard would get off my tail!!
No Honey, I haven't lost my excitement about us having a baby. I just never comprehended the craving thing 'till now.
It's all part of Sea World's new public relations program!
At least we can ride in the carpool lane
It's hard on mileage but we can use the carpool lane.
Forget the elephant in the room, we have something much bigger to talk about.
What could I do? He was in a kill shelter.
Ugh, I hate this song.
It's no different from you spouting off back there.
He took the bait ... hook, line, and blinker.
I liked the puppy, too, but, I don't know ...
Ok, I'll clean it if you cook it
What? You're the one who wanted to Uber Carpool.
I checked and the condo bylaws say nothing whatsoever about whales.
You sure this restaurant serves krill?
They were all out of mermaids.
Vegan? Since when??
You're krilling me, Dave
Let's *not* call him Ishmael.
okay, I hear yeah..."closer than they appear."
You really believe he could be alive inside there?
Still better than a kid
What?...He's chipping in for gas!
I told you the shelter wouldn't take him.
I'm sensing you're moving on and that I'm not the most important thing in your life now.
Are you sure this is sustainable?
Call the hotel and see if they take pets.
Ok, she is a whale and this is a car, but we still have to talk about it!
I just wanted a " little " something to remember our trip by .
Well, maybe if your mother whale-sat once in awhile...
There's no such thing as a free Willy.
Greenpeace ride share service is great... until migration season.
Grateful for the back up camera
Well, if you're not going to address the elephant in the room...
I thought they said this car was a whale of a deal not a deal with a whale
"I had no idea what 'drive-through bulk sushi' really meant"!
Don't worry. I'm a natural born kriller.
We really need to find a closer day care for him.
We are all mammals here
Maybe we should have followed the "catch and release" rules.
No, I think it's more than just a mirage.
Could you please push your seat up?
Remember, you said I got to pick out our next pet.
Some fin wrong?
His friend helped me get off that island. A Broadway show is the least I can do.
We'll get him to the ocean in two minutes. Maybe they won't know he's missing.
YOU wanted to use the carpool lane!
Honey, he's got a point. All the other eight year olds get to sit in the front.
I just need to stop for some more krill.
They'll never believe me otherwise.
The rules were clear! What happens at Sea World stays at Sea World.
How long are we going to save this whale?
I bet he'll taste just like chicken
The doubters will have to believe us this time!
He's hitchhiking to the Pacific.
There's a whale in this car that I think we really need to talk about!
They really overdid it with the party favors.
On the bright side, we'll never need another oil change.
So maybe it's not the great white whale, but it's still pretty great if you ask me.
We'll address the elephant in the room and explain he's no longer the largest land mammal.
You were the one who wanted a hybrid!
Yeah, but the trip wouldn't be as fun without Jonah.
I wish you'd stop calling him that. You know very well that he's a mammal!
Remember that day when we first brought him home from the State Fair, he was so cute in that plastic bag . Now I think we need a bigger car .
The car steers itself when it fish tales.
Maybe he should sit up front so he doesn't get seasick.
I'm beginning to think Sparky might not be part beagle after all.
It didn't look that deep, did it?
He said he just finished reading "Moby Dick" and he needed a drink.
Well, we wouldn't have to walk him!
So far, so good with the test drive. What makes you think there's a catch?
It's times like these that make me glad we bought a convertible.
Well, you kept ignoring the elephant in the room.
I know it's Jonah's bar mitzvah gift, I only hope his parents are going to be as amused as you.
It's the latest concept in bio fuel.
And then the guys says to me, "looks like you're gonna need a bigger car".
But you always said you wanted a Minke.
For the last time, we are not almost there.
I think you misunderstood when I said "we need to get our hump back"
I'd be more worried if he ate something other than plankton.
Stop complaining. Our next motel has a pool and an ocean view.
Fine. Your mother was right about me. I'm just a useless whale thief. Are you happy now?
That's the third vet today who would not honor their 'spay your pet for free' service. I'm calling Bob Barker.
This Uber rideshare thing has a few minuses.
Honey, would you tilt your mirror up a touch?
In case you didn't know, our car loan is under water.
OK, so we won. What's next?
Well, what happened in Vegas didn't stay in Vegas.
I agree--on long road trips, a one-song repertoire is rather annoying...
That wasn't weed, Clara.
Well, it won't bark like a dog.
I never should have brought along that CD of whale music. He's been singing harmony for - what - 137 miles now?
I don't think anyone saw us.
Guy behind me is blowing his top.
If you don't like the song just ask him to change it.
Honey carpooling in the HOV lane doesn't just save time, it saves the environment.
Look, we needed something to remember our summer vacation.
Well, guess what? You married this blowhole.
Well, you said if I could fit it in the car I could take it home...
You know I hate it when your uncle Ahab comes on vacation with us
But they say it burns more cleanly than biodiesel!
I can't believe the vet wouldn't see him unless he was in a carrying case.
I liked it better when the limit was two-per-day.
He's your friend. You tell him he has bad breath.
Can we talk about this later?
Once again - it will go nicely with my seashell collection.
What happened to "Take only pictures, leave only footprints?"
And you said we didn't need a minivan.
You know if upsets him when we drive past the old Arthur Treacher's.
I cleaned his blowhole the last time we stopped.
Can you believe Costco had this on sale for 99 cents per pound?
Check or carry-on?
I'm sorry honey, but we couldn't just leave it there!
Well we couldn't just leave him there stranded.
Well what did you expect would be all over the back seat? It's damn sperm whale!
You're right, we should have taken the wagon.
Wow, the guy behind us is really fish tailing!
At least the trunk won’t pop open.
I've never had good luck with hitchhikers.
I don’t care if Alaska Cruises has banned us for life. We Ahabs can finally hold our heads high again.
Look, I'm not a mind-reader o.k.? You you wanted to do something different tonight.
So where are we supposed to put the Turf?
This REALLY wasn't what I had in mind when they asked me to help with SAVE THE WHALES
I may have hit something. Did you see anything?
I know I told you that there's plenty of fish in the sea but whales are actually mammals.
He needed a lift to the beach...
Where's Ahab when you need him?
Would you mind moving your head to the left a little bit?
Tell me again, which ocean?
Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time.
For the last time, it’s a mammal, and no, you won’t have to clean the tank.
I tried. He wouldn't fit down the toilet.
We're not in a room, and I don't see an elephant.
HOV Lane?
Next time please don't "Reply All"
I promise I'll feed it
I forgot the krill.
I think you took the sign "Free Willy" too literally!
What? You think I should have said no?
From now on call me Ishmael.
I think the hospital gave us the wrong baby.
I'm starting to think shells would have been the better souvenir?
Next time don't say I am hungry enough to eat a whale.
I think it will look fine over the mantle.
Whale, whale. Look who's back.
I'm getting sick of these whale cartoons too.
Ever get the feeling you're about to be krilled?
I think the voice GPS misunderstood when you told it we wanted to go to Wales.
The car salesman said it was a whale of a deal.
This wouldn't be a problem if we had bought the SUV.
Who said that you should only watch them?
BE HONEST...IT'S MY BREATH, ISN'T IT?
Do we have to pick up every stray that comes along?
Who knew that an old Plymouth Barracuda would be such good bait?
What's with all these The New Yorker whale jokes lately?
It's going to have to be one more thing we don't talk about.
It goes without saying you can't beat the pound unit price at Big Al's Fish Depot.
He's just whining because we're going hiking this year.
Look...I'll tell you the same thing I told Ishmael. This will not come between us.
Now do you see why I wanted an SUV?
Well, the car dealer DID promise us a whale of a deal.
It's not my fault you didn't make any friends at the zoo.
Well, tailfins are back, and they're farm-raised.
What? It's just a few miles out of our way.
You believe in the Jonah Bible story, but not global warming?
When they mentioned adopting a whale, I thought it was symbolic.
The hump back seat came standard.
You're the one who said I should drive for Uber.
So, what do you know about krill?
I suppose if Jonah's Wife had been there God wouldn't have ever heard the end of it !
Do you think Customs will notice?
What??? Sea World was getting rid of it.
Do you get the feeling we're being tailed?
Okay, you were right; we should have been practical and taken the convertible.
Well that's what we get for Japanese engineering.
PokémonGo has really gotten out of hand.
I agree picking up hitchhikers is dangerous, but this one only eats krill.
Don't look at me. He wouldn't have gotten the idea if you hadn't insisted on that bumper sticker.
Maybe next year we can start a different anniversary tradition?
We're paying a fortune for that school, and they won't let them have pets in the dorms!
Why was it they told us not to feed the whales?
We're out of oil.
It's an air freshener, and yes, it's organic.
If we drive straight through, it will still be fresh when we get to Kansas.
Did something about the dealer smell fishy to you?
Finally our neighbours will believe our fish story
Well, how about fish tacos for dinner?
How do you get to Nineveh?
I guess we could use a new air freshener.
Is this the mobile equivalent of the elephant in the room?
Honey, do you ever feel like we're being too protective of little Jonah?
We'll have to cancel Uncle Ahab's dinner invitation.
...after this...no more road kill
I appreciate your 'Save the Whales' mentality, but now what?
At least I gave up Bee Keeping
At least we can use the HOV lane.
Sure, we're fishtailing a bit. What did you expect?
I'm sorry, but, yes, your mural over the fireplace has to go.
What I had REALLY wanted... was a Bat-mobile...
I happen not to care for that new car smell.
Does it smell like fish in here?
No, I'm keeping the radio on, Mike. No offense, but your singing puts me to sleep.
Now do you regret not getting a sunroof?
Remember when you used to say I was the catch of a lifetime?
Are you sure Petco has 5 trillion krill in stock?
Could you open your mouth a bit so I can back out?
If you say we'll have a whale of a time, ONE more time......
Well, how about the Walthers? Their pool is Olympic size.
We seem to be slowing down since that low water crossing.
Can we squeeze in a visit to the aquarium?
Oh, and I suppose YOU could have gotten us a better deal?
I wish for just one summer we did not have to go to the beach.
We've been urging it on our bumper for years; it's put up or shut up time.
You're the one who said we should car pool.
This isn't the carpool I was expecting.
Did we have to borrow Jonah's car?
You don't find it soothing?
Do you think they have plankton at PetSmart?
I thought you only wanted to pick up some sea shells.
The app said Uber Pool.
You knew I wanted a large family.
This is much more impressive than a hood ornament.
Where to now Ahab?
Sure enough, we fishtailed on that black ice.
I'm sorry you're so upset, Bob, but I'm not going to drive all the way across town just so you can get a plankton latte.
I can imagine your mom being very comfortable in the backseat.
I always wanted a car with big tail fins like my Dad's had.
Look, he powers the car and gets us into the HOV lane.
Maybe we shouldn't have used "PLANK10" for our personalized license plate.
You might say he's an out pod-cast.
This is the LAST time I tell you that you can have anything you want while on vacation.
I have a sinking feeling that symbolism has hitched a ride with us
What happened to the elephant in the room?
You said you didn't want a pet you'd have to take for walks.
Another benefit of my Alaska mileage club, honey.
This is not a good idea for a SAVE THE WHALES campaign!
No one thought 'Shark Week' would fly, either.
I think we've got a tail.
We're going to have to get a bigger pool.
We can buy a bigger freezer.
For what it's worth, we're all a little blue today.
Think leftovers.
I want a divorce.
"Should we stop and buy a bigger pan?
You'll be happy we have rear-whale-drive once the rains come!
I never would have expected this based on his Uber rating...
This is not the kind of whale watch I thought we were going on.
I've had left ventricles bigger than this car.
But the shelter threw in a free bag of krill.
You'll be more comfortable in your new school.
The marine biologist said I had 48 hours to return it.
Is it strictly symbiotic?
All I said was that it smelled like fish in here...
Does it seem to you that this car is doing a lot of fish tailing?
Yes, we saved the whale, but it's killing our fuel efficiency.
It's getting hard to keep up with the Joneses.
Our mileage has really dropped since we installed those fins.
What did you think I meant when I said whale watching?
Fine. I'll call you Ishmael. Now, can we go home?
You know, your dating profile said it was a dolphin.
Technically, he was hitchhiking, not stranded.
What are you blubbering about now?
Do you even know what 'keeper' means?
He used the Lyft app, just like you.
Whew! We really fishtailed back there.
Tom, Moby Dick and Harry go on a road trip.
Honey, do you still have your grandmother's gefilte fish recipe?
Where did we go wrong with him?
This is why we can't go to IKEA anymore.
Yes, you always have to sit on the hump back there.
Do you remember that time when the kids spilled their aquarium in the back seat?
So his mom is at Seaworld, but you're sure there's visitation?
Yes, another whale cartoon.
I got a whale of a deal on this car!
Humpback, hatchback, there all the same.
Should we address the whale in the backseat?
Maybe we should stop grocery shopping at the warehouse store. We'll never use up this fish before it spoils.
Okay, now that we got that elephant out of the room, can we talk about the whale in the car?
I'm just trying to save the plankton
She's a rescue from Sea World.
Now what Ahab?
It's not what I had in mind when you asked me to help you with the Save the Whales weekend.
I told you it was a mistake to take the Holland Tunnel.
Tailgating has gotten out of hand.
I thought you liked pod casts?
Let it go. You know you won't take care of it.
Should we sign him up for swimming or soccer next year?
You should of seen the one that got away
I think we can dispense with the booster seat now.
I knew there was a reason you wanted to take my car.
"Well, whats your idea of a "whale of a good time"?
If you don't keep it down back there I'm driving this thing straight to Sea World.
Uber pool.
Well, what about the swimming pool?
We did sign up for an authentic whale watching experience.
Remind me why we pick up hitchhikers at the beach, again?
You're not going to tell me the big fish little pond story again?
Catch and release, not catch and lease!
I told you: there are times when we will need a pickup.
I thought whale watching was done in a boat
Look at the bright side. We can open a sushi bar.
Why does he keep calling me Jonah?
YOU feel like a fish out of water...
"Did you by any chance have tuna for lunch?
Fine, we'll go back to the aquarium and I'll put it back.
Must you insist on calling it a whale of a tale?
But no, you had to bait your hook with krill.
But your match.com profile said you were looking for someone wanted to "Save the Whales".
GPS says 45 minutes to Seaworld.
This is what you call from the sea to the table
So maybe I did overbuy.
C'mon, it'll look great on the wall.
You're the one who said we had to save the manatees
Can we get krill at the drive-thru?
Soccer?? I thought tonight was his lacrosse team meeting...
I'm perfectly aware of how my daily commute is destroying the environment.
You said you wanted sushi tonight.
I said the car needs a new wheel.
I think we were just supposed to donate money to Greenpeace.
I'd prefer we discussed the 'Elephant in the Room'.
Wait for it...I'm calling it Bl-uber.com.
Another whale cartoon. That's all we are, another whale cartoon."
Even if I did hit him, which I did not, who's gonna care--he's obviously a stray.
You're sure this bulk shopping will save us money?
Steve, stop being a back seat diver!
My doctor said whale sounds would pacify my emotions.
...and to what exactly are your referring by 'the elephant in the room?'
The baby won't stop whaling.
I really don't think a bigger car seat is the best solution.
It better not be pregnant.
Do you reckon she’s blocking the view of our “save the whales” sticker?
Well Ahab, I guess we can end the search
Ironically, I call him Willy.
Do you think they will miss him?
You heard me ask, they don't have the McKrill anymore!
Lucky thing they didn't check the back seat, huh?
I told you we needed an SUV, but nooooo.
It was free
I told you we were being tailgated...
Well, you can just call me Ishmael.
Why in the world did you use krill for bait?
I told you to throw it back!
You're kinda being a third whale.
It was dark, OK? I really thought I was picking up your mom.
You do realize how much we're saving on delivery charges?
No Krill Till Brooklyn.
You have that "elephant in the room" look on your face.
Why are you suddenly filtering everything I say?
We take car pooling very seriously at the aquarium.
You know that old washtub in the basement, over by the sink?
When we get to the airport, I think you should check it.
I thought we agreed no more strays.
I hear that loose fanbelt again
Try the carp pull lane.
We're just avoiding the issue if we talk about some elephant in a room.
Yeesh...it really smells of blowhole in here.
Got any krill?
It promised gas money.
It's not as easy to find motels with pools these days.
Sure, but the tax break we get for having the baleen filter out all our emissions totally offsets the reduction in fuel efficiency.
Still think my Whale On Board sticker is a stupid idea?
He has to stop blubbering soon, right?
Ok, I'll admit I failed to read the small print in the carpool aggreement.
He needs a ride to Baja. Says he has a sure thing.
What did you think I meant when I said we'd have a whale of a time on our first date!!!
Can I recommend Uber XL the next time you have to visit the vet?
You ever get the feeling you are being followed by an obvious metaphor?
They'll never believe the one that got away.
We could get pulled over for fishtailing.
Oh, great--we're being whalegaited.
All right, no more cars off of Craigsfish.
We need to find a vet who does house calls
If we don't pull over soon, I'm going to breach.
One whale of a car, huh?
Do you mind closing the windows, I'm getting a little too much air back here.
You shouldn't just throw around words like "divorce."
Admit it - my choice to go with the salt water pool is looking pretty smart
Next time I'll pick the podcast.
They call me Ishmael.
Next time, we try Sea Monkeys.
Point taken: Don't leave shrimp salad in the backseat.
But I've always picked up hitch-hikers.
Do you think our elephant in the room is jealous?
I told you my name was Ahab when I asked you out.
You have to admit we got a whale of a deal!
I know, but they said they were a pet friendly hotel.
Couldn't you have just downloaded the mp3 file to relax?
Look, the guy said it was raised organically. What else do you want from me?
Besides scaring kayakers, he's pretty well behaved.
It's either a Pokémon sighting or a global warming event.
I thought the invite read whaling exhibition, not expedition.
Do we still have Ahab's number?
You said you thought I needed to go out and get my white whale. So, I went out and I got him.
Is this your first ride in a BlUber?
He needed a ride to school.
Well, technically it's a humpback, not a sperm, but either way I'm not implying anything.
When I signed up to drive for Uber, I knew I might get some strange passengers, but this?
Catch and release? I catch it, I eat it.
...whale kabob, whale burgers, whale gumbo, whale steaks...
What do you mean, what shall we feed it?! Let's start with how the hell did it get there!!
Will your college friends ever grow up?
It's not my fault, The GPS said here lives the Prince of Wales.
I still think the Prius would be greener.
You were right about krill breath!
He asked if we knew the way. We're going to San Jose anyway. So what's the big deal?
Can we talk about the elephant in the room?
Sure, it's a bit unwieldy, but you can really sense its gratitude.
I know by your look that this is not quite what we both thought, when I recommended whale watching.
Strange... Why did he cross the road?
That's the last time we buy Costco for Thanksgiving dinner.
Stop at the taxidermist first?
I dress up as a whale, and you go as a krill. What's the problem?
Marge, stop being such a humpback-seat driver.
Do you want to talk about the elephant in the room?
Now, you're sure (italicized for emphasis) Costco has krill by the pallet?
I’m sorry this isn’t what you expected when you chose the über pool.
We can't go home until we find Nemo.
But who would believe it if we didn't bring it home?
Am I crazy or do you smell krill?
Of course it is worth it. Now we can use the HOV lane.
Stop that whaling in the back!
I think this will solve our krill problem.
What happened to the Koi pond idea.
Wanna stop for krill?
Can we stop at the next rest stop for water?
I'm still glad we didn't get the minivan.
Didn't I tell you the backup camera wasn't working?
Metaphor for what election?
I was up for whale watching, not whale adopting.
He insisted when he heard me say "carpool."
I think we're going to need to check our baggage.
Where did you say your perfume was from?
But Honey, it was a steal; zero down, zero interest and six month's free krill.
Bastard's been whalegating me the whole ride home.
I don't mind your brother, really, but he's beginning to feel like a third whale.
Weekends with Willy
Believe me, the pond is much bigger than you think.
We could move closer to the beach.
Worst back seat diver ever.
Shoot, my tail light's out.
'Honey, do you smell something fishy?'
Fishtailing I get, but this...
Moby loves Adele, too.
On a 10 pound line? Really?
I don't know! How could he even set the pick up location without fingers?
That car with the fins is following much too close.
We really shouldn't have ignored that recall notice.
Next year when we go to the ocean, would you consider just bringing a seashell home?
He says he's Chris Christie, the Governor of New Jersey. He says, he fell off the Boardwalk into the water, and turned into a fish,...and he wants you to take him to Trump Tower to see the Wizard? Ok, where's John Quinones?
Do you ever feel like you're being watched?
Gosh honey, do you think we got too caught up in the bidding at Sea World?
He sounds just like you in the shower.
I didn't even know they sold these at Costco.
I don't like to miss any HOV lane requirements.
I said I need your sperm, Will. Not your Sperm Whale.
If you're going to sing, could you at least learn the lyrics?
Don't worry, I saved the receipt if it doesn't fit
They did say BYOW to this whale watch, didn't they?
Your the one who selected Uber ride-share.
Yes, I concede. You're a better at packing a car than me. I just hope you're as good at unpacking.
Don't blame me, I wanted a pet goldfish. You were the one who insisted we get an animal that could sing.
Which way to the carpool lane?
I'm sure glad you called "Shotgun"
Now remember, it's your responsibility to feed it.
We are going to need a lot of chips!
Did you douche today?
Fine, the next time we buy a car, you can negotiate.
The luggage always seems heavier returning from the beach.
Well, you should have heard what the guy at U-Haul said.
He's my brother from another mother.
The new car smell is overrated.
The producer completely trashed my "Whalenado" pitch.
And you're sure your dad doesn't already have one?
Greenpeace ran out of tote bags.
Do you think we can just sneak into our room and avoid the pet deposit fee?
We'll get a bigger aquarium.
I'm glad the other one got away!
Returning to the land can't be easy for him either.
I can't just tie him to a lamp-post and drive away.
You know that it makes my rear view mirror virtually unusable.
I don't care if it's a mammal. I should have won that fishing contest.
Do you notice that the car doesn't have the power it used to have when we first bought it?
We'll stop at the next exit for gas and krill.
See, I told you we needed a mini-van.
What am I going to do, pay for movers?
You said to get the catch of the day.
Don't blame me, you're the one that wanted to go to the Marine World inventory clearance sale!
If you can stop squirming... we'll be at Bill's Krill Shack in 20 minutes.
Sure, she's hard to care for, but her pics are getting me tons of likes on Instagram.
Do you smell something fishy?
You're sure it's mine?
Now don't you wish we'd gone for the SUV?
But I promised him a whale sighting by the end of summer.
Please quit your wailing.
How was I supposed to know he would grow up to be the world's largest animal?
I don't care if he is a right whale--he's just wrong to be tailgating us.
For the last time - it's not pink, it's not an elephant and, technically speaking, this is not even a room. So, NO, I don't want to talk about it.
It does not smell fishy. It smells like marine mammal.
I hope the pet shop hasn't run out of krill
Well, that proves it. You'd pick up anything!
How could I know he's allergic to shellfish?
I thought we were renting a Peugeot. This car drives like a Pequod.
I'm his sponsor Jennie? What did you want me to say? 'No, he can't stay in our pool for a little while?
...so then I told Cheryl, it's not paranoia if you really are being followed.
It's not a bad as having an elephant in the room.
A lot of people are underwater on their car loans. We’re not in that bad of shape.
I told you they'd charge extra if we took him to the drive-in.
So I've taken this new gig with Gruber--It' sort of a cross between Greenpeace and Uber.
Of course there’ll be changes in road kill with global warming.
Why do you always make that face when I say something is a whale of a good idea?
He shouldn't feel cramped. After all, we rescued him from SeaWorld!
It's the world's most powerful hybrid.
Carpool karaoke just isn't the same with only humpback whale songs.
The dealer was right. I'm amazed at all the room in the back seat.
What makes you think I went fishing?
Since when are you so against hitchhikers?
What luck! I won with my first toss of the ping pong into the fish bowl.
It's a rescue whale.
How could I resist? It came with a trailer and everything.
Look, they will never believe us without the evidence!
I think we have a tail.
Apparently, our Chrysler isn't as big as a whale.
This Uber gig is getting out of control.
Did your mother really have to come with us on date night?
Even the car salesman said I got a whale of a deal.
Now you tell me about your seafood allergy!
I'm sorry but I have a soft spot for strays.
I think it's time we discuss the elephant in the room.
The beach. Again. I wish we could go to the mountains for once.
You always said you wanted to "Save the Whales"
I thought you said "rent a humpback".
I just don't get it. Everyone at work says they have no problem getting a sitter.
"It's a rescue whale and you are always complaining we don't use the pool enough".
I know I said I'd do catch and release, but define "release."
I don't usually pickup hitchhikers but we were heading its way.
I'm putting my foot down. Melanie is absolutely forbidden to go out with any more sperm whales.
How are you going to nag a driver-less car?
Well, did you have a better plan to free Willy?
Maybe we should have adopted a cat.
I don't care, you still need to wear your seatbelt.
This will be the tenth time he sang 'California Girls'.
you said you wanted a whale of a time.
Feel like seafood?
I told you. I'm not hiding anything!
Well, at least she's hypoallergenic.
Do you think they exaggerated the superior cargo area in this car?
The B-52s were wrong about Chryslers.
I can see plenty in the side mirrors.
How was I supposed to know what they meant by "Whale of a deal1"
We'll give some to our neighbors,then what?
Hey! You may be dreaming but what about me!
We need to discuss the elephant in the room here.
This guy is totally whale-gating me!
I thought "fresh catch of the day" was a safe bet.
You know the first time you called me Ahab it was kinda funny...now, not so much.
Good thing we drove the convertible for this fishing trip.
Well we did discuss getting a car with fins.
Remember when I asked if I should go left at the pier and you said right?
This is the last time!...Next time Larry gets tanked,he can call himself a cab!
Well, no one would have believed it otherwise
I know this really great place down by the beach. Are you good with krill?
I don't know , Jonah. What do you want to do?
So, should I call you Ishmael?
So, what do we think of our new hybrid?
So much for this car having room for five.
But I thought phishing was only virtual.
Honey, have you showered lately?
I found Dory.
We're going to need a bigger cracker.
This guy tailgating me is a real Moby Dick.
It wasn't my idea to save him.
Do you think he will be happy at the lake?
When you said we'd have a whale of a time, this isn't what I pictured.
Are you sure we're out of breath mints?
The guy said this car was a 'reel deal,' but I didn't know it came with a catch!
Just sit tight til the waters recede.
I know but his sense of direction is better than a GPS so I will never need to ask for directions.
Just the fish food store and we're done.
I'm not going inside of it. It's your Dad.
All I said was it looks like your mother.
No - I don't have no idea how he got the Uber app.
Your 'stop for all hitchhikers' policy has to change?
What does your GPS have for Migratory Hot Spots?
You don't think this is better than the driftwood lamp?
The new Chrysler Baleen also features 300 horses under the hood...
You rarely see hitchhikers anymore.
I think we overdo it. Noah didn't have to invite any sea animals.
Now they'll believe me when I say, 'I caught the big one.'
Did you remember to pack the toothbrushes?
Yeah, like you've never taken a wrong turn?
Are you sure you don't want me to move up my seat?
I was always Uncle Ahab's favorite.
The worst thing is that he's blocking my mirrors.
I think there's someone tailing us.
Jonah! Jonah! Wake up-you're not going to believe this!
Don't worry. It’s a rescue.
Please stop saying, "Okay, Ahab!"
I said, "Let's go to the love shack." You said, "Only if you can prove your car is as big as a whale."
Yes, his singing is off-key. Yes, he only eats Krill, but he took a harpoon for me, I owe him.
Can you run in for the fish food?
I asked for the smallest one they had.
I just hate it when people whalegate me.
We need to talk about Kevin.
It followed me all the way on to the beach, we have to take it home with us.
This is why my parents told me not to marry a Jonah
You're krilling me, Bob.
...It'll keep the cats fed for several years...
This should do wonders for my UberXXL rating.
On weekends, I help pick up marines from the airport.
Did you eat anchovies for lunch again?
Thanks for riding UberPool.
Hey YOU'RE the one who wanted a compact car!
I know you don't like stopping for hitchhikers, but you have to admit it's kind of intriguing to see one of these guys with a thumb.
My parents are going to krill me.
And your positive your sister likes whales, right?
That guy behind up has been tailgating us for miles.
Are tail fins making a come back?
You said to go pick-up Jonah.
Rescuing the whales was your idea. I didn't count on providing a home for one of them.
Jonah's fine - we're almost at the hospital.
we couldn't leave him at sea world
You've never liked any of my school friends.
I am feeling like sushi tonight and every night for the rest of the year, how about you?
Can you believe they were just going to detonate this thing?
At this point, I think you should be a little more worried about our sustainability.
Are the krill supplements in the trunk?
Wasn't there a whale in last week's Cartoon Caption Contest?
Now, aren't you glad we bought the larger hot tub?
Did we, or did we not, drop the kids?
Dick.
Stop blubberin'.
Last time I ever drive this drunk asshole home. Fuckin' krill all over my back seat. Nasty.
Better call Ishmael
Isn't the third rider supposed to be inside the car for the HOV?
Whale Lives Matter!
How do you know about the elephant in my room?
Are fins going to be the rage again?
This isn't a typical Uber call.
I give up, we'll get the cetacean wagon.
You?re sure that a goldfish wouldn't have satisfied the kids?
An excessive choice of souvenirs, Elaine.
Are you in the mood for Sushi tonight?
When you said, "save the whale," I was hoping the vet would be closer.
This isn't what I expected when you said your cousin was a whale from Vegas
I told you a picture would have been a lot easier!
Oh come on we'll have a whale of a time. "my ass"
I'm telling you--you're wrong. It's not over-fishing unless you take many of them.
Don't make me turn this car around.
I know, but SeaWorld keep dragging their feet.
You seem dubious that eating sperm whale every day will be a solution to our infertility problem?"
Should I let him pass?
I wonder where they go in the winter.
I've never seen beach traffic this heavy.
Now that we took care of the elephant in the room...
I swapped a guitar for it.
What whale?
Technically, it's a mammal, not a fish
Do you think Whole Foods has some plankton?
Do you have a deodorizer?
Hey, you're the one who forgot the camera!
I don't even want to be in an HOV lane.
It said "seats three"
We're being whale gated.
This is the last time I volunteer to give Jonah a ride home!
I believe the correct term is "Elephant in the room."
Just let him spout off about his politics , I've opened the sun roof .
They say blubber is fuel efficient.
Gotta go back. Forgot the lemons.
There's something fishy going on with the back up camera.
But honey, he was free!
Yes, our acceleration does seem a bit sluggish.
The ad said $2.00 per pound... It did not say I had to buy the whole fish.
Yeah, but think of all the mileage we'll get out of our story.
I say, to hell with the seat belt law.
I can't wait until we get rid of the "new car smell".
No I think that outfit actually makes you look thinner
Don't give me that look. I don't want krill for dinner either.
Why did you tell them we were marine biologists?
Now, maybe you'll believe me
Nice choice, using Ahab as a lure.
So it did say school crossing.
"I think the trunk ornament was a terrible idea
Your mother said there is never enough gefilte fish for the high holidays
You'll see....this one will be special!
I promised my little girl she can have any pet she wants, so long as she takes care of it.
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH TARTAR SAUCE.
Relax. Enjoy your vacation. You're probably smelling a spritz of seabreeze air freshener. The rental agent guaranteed me it was cleaned inside and out just before he drove it around.
"Sorry, I was following the G.P.S.
I beg to differ: Cetology is actually Melville's finest chapter.
So I’m the only one who enjoys our trips to the seashore?
Did you hear something?
Did you brush your teeth this morning?
I feel good. We're adopting the newly orphaned whale from contest #532.
It's not a protected species if it's trying to swallow you.
You promised you'd be supportive of my gluten-free diet.
I'm new to this dating site...now what ?
You really should have ordered an UberXL
I still don't see how this improves our carbon footprint.
We can convert the den.
We need a bigger car seat.
Look, I like him. It's just that I assumed you meant you had a big idea.
Whale, are we there yet?
Just be glad we have a convertible.
This does not even up for my elephant in the room.
Come on, anyone could confuse Bally's Irish with Irish Baleen.
Say what you will, I think it was a helluva catch.
Good thing he's not a puffer fish.
I don't know why you're so upset; I told you we'd have a whale of a time."
This is not what I expected when I gave to the "adopt-a-whale" program!
This oil will last longer than that fancy stuff.
I should have known something was fishy when the used car salesman said his name was Herman Melville.
I just wish he's stop calling me Ahab.
It's an adult. I can't make it wear a seatbelt.
How can you be sure he's not an ax murderer?
And I think that bad attitude of yours is why we never get invited to parties.
How about another round of "Down by the Bay"?
How about we pull over at McPlankton's for lunch?
This is the last time I pick up a hitchhiker on the beach.
No, honey. I'm STILL not a dog person. I don't understand why you keep bringing this up.
He doesn't have too much blubber, honey...he's big boned!
Remember how little he was when we brought him home from the breeding grounds?
Kelp!
Wake Up!Someone's tailing us.
This is why you shouldn't let me watch Free Willy.
OK, when are we going to talk about the whale in the trunk?
Let the cat try his goldfish trick with this guy.
A little pampering and he'll be as good as new.
There's no satisfying you is there Gail.
Thank goodness he's asleep. One more John Cale song and I was gonna lose it.
Always a catch.
So I don't have a fishing license. That ain't no fish, right?
Sheila, when your said we'd have a whale of a good time, I assumed it to be a figure of speech.
His third wish was to be a Whale on Wall Street.
In hindsight, I think you would have been better off with an Uber Pool.
Let see the Joneses keep up with this!
Bad breath or not, at least HE knows all the words.
You were right, we should have gotten the minivan.
I should have slowed down when I saw the Whale Crossing sign.
Do we have enough Krill in the house?
I heard the mechanic, but what does he know about global warming?
So, do you know any good recipes?
I know you're upset, but the dealer said this was better that a Hatchback
The interior feels roomy.
keep your seatbelt on because I have a feeling we are going to fishtail.
Wake up, Honey, I think we are being tailed.
I'm saving gas but using a lot more krill.
Let's just talk about the elephant in the room here...
I told you going to the new sushi place IN Costco wasn't a good idea.
An elephant in our room wasn't enough?
I guess we now have to invite your relatives to dinner.
Let's just tell people they were having a closeout at Sea World and leave it at that.
Okay, so we're done with the elephant in the room. Now what?
"If a cop stops us we'll give him a fin."'
Ever have that feeling you're being followed?
What did you think "whaling" was?
I think we need to talk about the elephant in the room.
Think of the money we're saving by moving them ourselves.
Honey did you remember to close the garage door?
This is going to hurt my Uber rating.
We'll never find Nemo this way.
Okay, okay...the next person we see I'll ask directions.
Why? Because all your stuff is in the trunk.
Who says everything has to be educational?
I told you your mother wouldn't like it.
It's murder on the suspension but he's an excellent tipper.
Don't worry! I'll build a gigantic wall and the neighbors will pay for it!
It's cheaper than airbags and they need the work.
It's just the acid, man!!
Do you smell fish?
Whale?
At least, we didn't put our dog on the roof like the Romneys.
It does smell a bit fishy, doesn't it.
When you said you had a full tank I assumed there would be other fishes in it.
Do you get the feeling we're being followed?
Tell the cartoonist to call me Ishmael.
As long as the Immigration Agents haven't heard the story of the Trojan Horse, we'll be OK.
It smells like fish in here.
You said make sure the kids are strapped in, you didn't say how.
You realize of course that this is going to get us banned from SeaWorld.
Your face has 'excited' written all over it.
COULDN'T YOU GET A SMALLER SOUVENIR
Honey, please stop singing along with the whale.
What did you say you used as bait?
Air fresheners come with it.
This is NOT what I thought when you said it would be a whale of a good time.
Keeper is just a term. It doesn't mean you have to keep it.
Costco 2.0
It''s like a vintage Cadillac, with fins.
You said we were just getting toilet paper
Pull over at the next McPlankton's.
I thought it was a whale of a deal
This is precisely why we paid extra for the folding rear seat.
What do you mean you don't like fish?
Really Susan? After Yellowstone I thought you had learned your lesson
Dick, I still say we've bitten off more than we can chew on this trip!
At least he won't spend the commute talking on the phone.
I told you it was 'this big'!
This takes beach combing to a whole new level...
Melville was pretty good, but have you read Hobbes?
Listen, you don't become an ambergris kingpin without making some sacrifices.
I never promised to catch and release.
My boat is named Ahab, you knew that when you married me.
It's a throwback to the fins of the Fifties.
Did you pay the water bill?
I just catch 'em. You clean 'em.
Easily bored, aren't you?
Maybe I should have taken their offer to cut it up into fillets.
But he likes to feel the wind blow his baleen when we go fast/
Whale songs are crucial for taking the stress out of a long trip like this.
The sign said everything must go.
#Jonah
You said not to buy anymore fish, so I got a mammal.
Damn car fishtails.
We'll put him next to the white rhino and the snail darter.
I had a whale of a time, how about you?
I'm fine with Ish.
We should have gotten salmon instead.
I didn't know he'd be a Humpback-seat driver.
Technically, we're not fishtailing. That's a whale.
This is precisely why we paid extra for folding rear seat.
Elephant in the room just sounded so trite.
I've had it with back seat drivers.
Now where are we gonna put the chips?
Stop calling me Captain Ahab.
John you do realize that Sea World is going to be pissed right?
Someone needs to start eating salads.
Sure, entry may be cheaper at SeaWorld but they gouge you with the souvenirs.
It's the most eco-friendly hybrid you can buy -- and 60 nautical miles per gallon.
The waiter must have thought you were crazy to ask for a doggie bag.
When you told me Grayson was bringing his friend Jonah, you didn't tell me it was THAT Jonah.
I rescued him from a small island after a previous caption contest.
Just think of the 7,000 tuna fish sandwiches
Now let's sing a song we all know.
I told you we'd have a whale of a time in the back seat.
I couldn't afford the island and the whale, so I just got the whale.
The ad said 1956 model with dual tailpipes and fins on the back.
This is not my idea of "a whale of a time"
At least the monkey is gone.
I know you're not a cat person, but they're just so much lower maintenence.
I'm tired of Gordon Lightfoot too, but it his playlist.
Why do you s'pose the peg-leg guy was cussing me?
You guys in the mood for sucking down some shrimp?
Is apparition spelled with one or two p's?
You never asked 'why' I owned a convertible when we first started dating...
I wonder which restroom it will be using.
I told you when we met: Love me, love my whale.
Now that I finally caught it, I thought you would feel more excited for me.
I think we may have missed our exit.
Should we discuss the elephant in the room?
Do you think SeaWorld is going to notice the beluga is missing?
Where's your proof that cars cause global warming and costal flooding?
I'm thinking sushi restaurant
No, this time I assure you, it wasn't me.
Does your Mother have to come with us everywhere we go
No, I don't see a 800-pound gorilla here.
I'm having a whale of a time trying to get my seat to recline.
Can you just give me a warning the next time you read Moby Dick, Again?!
Okay, so maybe I shouldn't have mentioned we're headed up the coast.
No, I suppose Frisky doesn't HAVE to go everywhere with us, but he does love his car rides.
Well, I thought it was a whale of a deal!
Do you think this Pescatarian diet might be getting out of hand?
You didn't see Free Willy?
Your buddy need to stop for some krill or can we push on and make Albuquerque?
Apparently, not everyone is having a whale of a time.
I think the guy in back of us is finding this traffic hard to swallow...
Really. You should've seen the one that got away.
Like I told you "I caught a fish this big"
Mind if I'm smoked?
You never support my marine biology!
Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet?....
I know what you're thinking. Didn't I see it was catch and release?
Humpback? What Humpback?
I feel so wild. It's not even Friday
But I thought it would look great on the wall in the den.
'The seat is up as far up as it'll go, Henry. If that's not good enough you can get out and walk!"
This should be in The New Yorker.
You can boil it, broil it, steam it, sauté it, ....
He has absolutely no filter.
Well, yo momma so big she has her own zip code!
But, honey, I said I wanted to include Wales in our trip this summer!
They warned us about driving through standing water.
Seatbelt!
Do we have enough food for three days and three nights?
Do you really think this is what 'Save the Whales' means?
A little late to be saying "quit your blubbering," isn't it?
Do you have enough leg room back there? I can pull my seat forward...
You thought it was a catch and release tournament ?
We don't even have freezer space.
Wait'll I tell em about the one that got away.
You're the one who wanted to Uber.
It's best he go back to the ocean. The increasing cost of Krill now exceeds epinephrin pens.
I thought I asked for a hatchback.
I'm not lost!
I am starting to think we should have bought the bigger tank.
The sardines were way too expensive.
I know you wanted to test-drive the hatchback but we really think you will enjoy the brand new humpback.
We need a bigger car.
You're not the one with a low sperm whale count.
This isn't exactly what I meant when I said I wanted a "hybrid"
Yes, my sense of smell is just fine. Why?
The used car salesman offered me a whale of a deal!
No. I don't know a good drive-thru krill place.
I smell sushi.
See? Who needs a minivan!
Who cut the ambergris?
C'mon, we won't have to go shopping till next August!
Wales, wail, whale, explain it again . . .
So what did you expect I'd get from SeaWorld's Clearance Sale? A stuffed Shamu?
Ok, honey - I will delete my Mobile Dick App.
OK, poets are 'literalists of the imagination,' but when you said, 'We'll have a whale of a time...
Would you mind if he rode shotgun today?
So, nowhere we can stop for krill?
I thought we had a whale of a time.
It's a little DIY for the pompous environmentalist who can't afford a Tesla.
Guys, mind turning to the orca-stra station?
I like you a lot, but I feel like something's weighing us down.
Are you sure I shouldn't worry about my sperm count?
See? I told you it could fit a whale.
I wish we had something with more horsepower.
I told you, if we're going to rescue Shamu we can't rent a sub-compact.
I never use the rear view mirrors anyways !
No, I don't think that the fish needs a seatbelt.
Don't forget your seatbelt.
You're saying it's NOT the New Yorker Harpoon Capture Contest?
I don't think this is what they mean by "Save the Whales".
They say a mammal in the trunk is worth two in the...nope, not right.
Look, you got the front seat, and he gets to have the top down. Rules are rules.
I still don't know what was wrong with the beach we were just at.
But this was cheaper than the hatchback.
Next time we decide to go whaling, I think we should use a boat.
That was a good catch, Megan. Think of all the omega-3 we can eat.
Probably should have paid the delivery fee this time.
So is this your first time riding with Uber-Sea?
I don't know Bob. Something seems fishy to me.
I guess that makes us the eggmen
I hope you don't mind krill for dinner.
Look, I didn't invite him.
It was then that she longed for the elephant in the room.
We'll free Tibet *next* week. I promise.
Yes, yes, OK, so Mom and Dad named me "Jonah." What does it matter?
Then we added Seaworld to the car pool...
Well I thought YOU packed his krill!
I knew going to Sea World was a bad idea.
Sure, fine, I can admit he may not have been "thumbing" for a ride after all. Now can YOU admit we'd be better off not bringing it up anymore?
You're gonna need a bigger fish tank.
At least we left the elephant in the room
I know you wanted babbling brook, but it's my car and the soothing sound I wanted was whale song.
You're the one who wanted Seaworld to pay me overtime.
This is a bad idea. Sushi leftovers is not a thing.
What did you put in my drink?
So it's baleen, not blue tooth!
Sometimes a "beached whale" is just a beached whale.
Excuse me for trying to liven up our staycation.
Guess we have to look for a largest animal vet
You're the one who suggested the shore route
I told you to get the freezer fixed!
I am so glad you called shotgun today.
Ok Ishmael. Now what do we do?
Because he's cartoon family. That was his brother on the small island a couple of weeks ago.
When did he get so big?
Fins are very retro.
Sorry I really didn't see this coming
I know the whales at Seaworld are unhappy, but this is ridiculous.
And you said that they didn't take VISA at Whale-Mart!
it's a whale of a view in the rear-view mirror
That was one heck of a sale of a whale.
We’ve all made mistakes, just admit the note should have read "Do not open, giant inflatable mammal inside".
There's whale steak, whale salad, whale and grits, whale curry, whale stew, whale...
Did you have fish for lunch?
And here I was thinking all that legroom in the back would make a difference...
So after the army I figured "what the heck!" Three years later here I am, full time golf pro.
Did you remember the lamp wick?
You knew I was an ethical pescatarian when you married me, Darlene.
And you thought it was just another fish story.
Well, who could pass up a sale price like that one!!
Ambergris, gas or grass; nobody rides for free.
OK, so stop calling me Ishmael.
Wouldn't a couple pounds of salmon be enough?
Just wait. It'll render big savings this winter.
It may seem silly now, but just wait!
"You can forget about the E-Z PASS lane"!
What whale in the room?
You gotta love that new Carp smell !
Then next time don't choose uberPOOL.
Trust me, this is the next big idea in meat CSAs.
I thought you said you always wanted to marry a marine biologist?
Sometimes you watch the whale; sometimes the whale watches you.
I know, but the humpback has more zip than the hatchback.
I know your mom wants grandkids, but did she have to rub my nose in it with the sperm whale?
While you were asleep, I came up with a really clever carpool joke.
Is this your first time using UberPool?
Think of it as a metaphor for whatever
And Yes, I'm going through security ahead of you.
Honey! I think this Greenpeace thing is going a little too far.
This is not what I meant when I said Humpback
This is the last time I am taking you whaling.
so this isn't your mother?
Well, at least we got rid of the elephant in the living room.
something smells a bit fishy
What??? You didnt really expect me to just leave him on the beach flopping around like that...did you?
I'm thinking sushi tonight for dinner. What do you think?
We're gonna need a bigger wall to mount this"
No worries...there's lots of fish in the sea.
I told you: when the three of us take a long trip, we'll wish we'd gone with the sedan.
Do you know what he keeps blubbering about?
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
Couldn't you just pick out a goldfish like the rest of your friends?
I should've know this new Honda Pequod would be trouble.
Maybe now your dad will believe that I really am a marine biologist! ('am' should be in italics, or different font, if possible -- though not necessary)
No. We just stopped an hour ago.
I still don't think he's got my eyes.
Couldn't we just buy our krill at the supplement counter like everyone else?
A Whale of a Tale-Gater
I really don't see why you're worried about the border crossing
What do you mean, global warming?
I know full well that it won't fit in the refrigerator, so we'll just have to cook and eat it tonight.
I dunno; maybe we should have just gotten a dog.
Next time yo may want to consider UberXL!
Seriously, there is a whale of a tail.
We could try to patent the bait.
I don't know about this raw diet.
I am not fishing for compliments but you are the one who keeps telling me size matters.
Fishy? You don't smell so springtime fresh yourself!
The mechanic says its worse than fishtailing.
did you ever get the feeling your being watched?
... and if you need to sneeze I'll open the sun-roof.
All we need now is 100 pounds of onion and carrots and a gallon of horseradish and we're on our way towards making the world's biggest gefilte fish!
I still think we should have thrown it back.
No one is gonna believe we used a 20 pound fishing line.
Yeah, but I baited the hook.
Yes, something does smell fishy, but I'm still not giving you my password.
Did we have to bring my mother-in-law?
Yeah, it gets on my nerves, but a humpback seat driver comes standard with a cetacean wagon.
I've never had one before.
To be fair, I did tell him to squeeze on in.
Does this make me look fat?
I promise, this is the year I finally get rid of my blubber.
Migration is so much easier with Uber pool.
It runs on biofuel.
You did stock up on krill, didn't you?
He's not going to fit in our bathtub.
That's what you get if you try and cross the BQE at rush hour
I told you he doesn't smell fishy.
Goldfish aren't as cuddly.
I don't see his parents driving any kids to swimming lessons.
...But can you get a hatchback into a humpback?
All right, have it your way - you smell krill.
Honey, wake up. That damn whale is following us again.
But no one will believe me if I can't show them the catch.
Wonder if I should have listened when she said "Recalculating!"?
No! We're not stopping for "all you can eat krill" again.
Now I see why most of your decisions were eel advised.
Now aren't you glad we installed that big bathtub?
So if someone asks you "Hast thou seen the white whale?" you can say "Yes, he's in my back seat."
Yeah, it's a thin line between "save" and "indulge."
The smell will fade in time.
Sure it's organic but I vote we go back to the traditional airbags.
Agreed?" "Joe's Bar and Krill for lunch?
...yeah but I'm pretty sure hitchhiking is only illegal for people though
By the way, did I ask if you liked sushi?
I warned you he's a back seat diver.
You weren't kidding when you said this car drives like a boat.
I always come home from Whale-Mart with a ton of crap I don't need.
I hire a whale and you're still bored.
I couldn't resist. I heard that baleen is the new quinoa.
Perhaps a sushi platter for the tailgate party is not such a great idea.
Slow down. You've already been fined once for being over the legal limit today.
Our next car is going to have one of those rear-view cameras.
I wish they still made the AMC Pacer.
I told you we needed a mid-size.
What's the big deal? It's not any more cruel than an aquarium.
I know! I know! You still think it's fishtailing.
I'll ask him to go, but it's hard to be the third whale.
You'd said we'd have a whale of a good time...had no idea it meant carting him around.
spoiler alert
I never could resist a bargain!
you said you wanted a big whopper.
When we get to the border, make sure your seat belt is buckled.
Did you feed the fish before we left?
I know I said call me if you or your friends get drunk but...
Oh, whale. I thought you said, third wheel.
Yeah, but you should have seen the one that got away.
I think if we move the gazebo we can make it work.
And Consumer Reports claimed that the back seat was too small for adults.
Why do you always find my excuses hard to swallow ?
I'll teach him to tailgate...watch me slow down to the speed limit.
I don't care--being an endangered species doesn't give him the right to be tailgating us.
It's your turn to walk her.
That is ridiculous. I did not adopt a rescue whale to keep your mother from backseat driving.
Thanks for calling shotgun first.
I know you said hatchback, but you've got to admit it's impressive.
Call me Ishmael.
Cindy, interracial relationships are no longer an elephant in the room.
Excuse me, I did try the plankton. I just wasn't crazy about it, alright?
Wish we remembered the pine tree air freshener.
I said I wanted to swim with a whale on my birthday.
Everything I do puts you to sleep.
'It's a whale of an idea but does it fit?"
Hey, sushi for days and the roof will pound out.
The license plate just wouldn't do?
Good thing you called "shotgun"!
It's the latest ride sharing app, Bl-uber.
It was supposed to be a hatchback.
I just ask that my home office be a no krill zone.
We're going to need a bigger freezer.
Honey, are you sure we should have gone with the humpback?"
I didn't know this was what Fahrvergnügen meant.
I can't think of a better way to show the IRS that MOBY is a legitimate deduction
Perhaps the neighbors might want some.
Hey, he did say it was a whale of a deal.
If you've got a better one for that cop, let's hear it.
I tried to warn you about Cape Cod traffic. At this rate, he is going to totally miss the reunion.
Yes, Bob, I'm having a whale of a time.
Trust me--Mankoff can't get enough of these babies.
Prince of Wales? I never said that!
Actually, I think she is fully ready for the deep end.
It said turn left, so I turned left, okay?
Wake up! Next rest stop there's a Krill Grill.
Tale or tail?--we should get our stories straight.
Not now Larry, I have bigger fish to fry
Hey, you said I could have a pet.
He ain't heavy. He's my brother!
I know... I know.. If he just hadn't been holding up his flipper in such a cute way.
Don't judge my folks by the wacky party favors they give; you'll love them when you know them better.
This has been the best beachcombing trip ever!
Just put your seat back and relax.
Upon reflection, the shi-tzu might have been the better choice.
A whale, a girl, and a surfer stepped into a Toyota.
I don't think it will fit on the grill.
Did you remember to order plankton?
At least we sold the Pinto.
Honey, I think we outgrew the sedan.
On second thought, maybe a Drive-Thru Aquarium wasn't such a good idea.
Okay, I'll do it... but I don't think one of those cardboard pine trees is going to make a difference.
I meant to tell you -- I used to be a harpoonist.
It's surprisingly roomy.
Remember when you said, 'Only pick up hitchhikers with a nice set of lungs....?
I don't know, I think it's a Pokémon?
Captain Ahab? I need an address, lady.
Sorry that took so long.
You're the one who said, 'let's go out for seafood.'
I wasn't sure what to get you for your birthday.
I swear the listing said drywall.
So they won't fit in your frying pan...what's a freezer for?
Phew what did you eat for lunch?
People always talk about the one that got away... not me!
Well, you're the one who suggested we watch Free Willy.
Honey, it's your imagination -- there is no elephant in the room.
When I said we should car pool, I didn't mean it literally.
Did you just say "James Thurber?" (Note to editors: please add this link: http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/60-minutes-favorite-new-yorker-cartoons/42/ or, even better, a newyorker.com link to The Seal in the Bedroom, if one is available)
It estimates the distance of the vehicle behind me, and inflates accordingly.
Don't look at me like that...this is the smallest size Price Chopper had.
I know, back seat divers are so annoying.
Uber for whales. I know it's gonna be big!
I was daydreaming about when you used to call the backseat of your hatchback, the humpback.
"Awww, you worry too much. We just have to buy a bigger aquarium, that's all.
The big one got away!
Well, I for one, had a whale of a time
Do we have any chips?
Tell me another tale.
Couldn't wait to inflate huh!
I told you we should have bought the mid-size sedan.
...For the last time... I'm not a misogynist! I just didn't think you'd catch anything!!
No she does not want to hear about Ahab, a priest and a rabbi sitting in a bar
I'm in my Blue period.
When you said 'get Beluga', how was I to know you meant caviar and not a whale?
I just don't want the kids to be disappointed when we tell them no pets besides a fish.
someone is on our tail again
Well, we really don't need much rear leg room
Its not an elephant and its in the car.
We got it off a guy on a tiny tropical island.
I got a whale of a discount on him at SeaWorld.
Sure, we're helping them, but it's killing my gas mileage!
By any chance did up leave that case of Costco Omega-3 Krill Oil supplements in the trunk?
Tacos?
So you told them we would bring a seafood platter?
I'm telling you, blubber-fuelled is the car of the future.
What? The invitation said, 'pot luck'.
How much sushi can one couple eat?
For the last time, we are not going to go cruising and pick up some immoral porpoises.
Save the whales you said.
We were the only bidders at the silent auction at the aquarium.
Look who's doing the watching now.
You did throw him back, didn't you?
Don't worry it'll look good over the mantle.
You agreed we could earn some extra cash with this Uber thing.
I thought you said take a Right!
E-SEA Pass.
It's been a whale of a day.
Biofuel has a long way to go.
I don't see how picking up a whale will help us win the caption contest.
Couldn't we at least do something about his breath?
He's adopted.
You said you wanted a whale of a good time...
No more "Sea World" documentaries, OK?
I could have sworn that cop said 'citation.'
I try to do the basics -- drive a hybrid, baleen not toothed.
This car has no acceleration since our trip to the beach.
Do you smell plankton?
Feeling blue?
I'm not lying. Really.
Can you turn the radio up? The sound is kinda muffled back here...
Replace the grill—I thought you said krill.
It's called the sharing economy, and there's nothing I can do about it.
I wouldn't mind except he keeps changing the radio station.
"Sarah Paleen" is too political for you?
Maybe we should consider an SUV?
I thought you were bringing the tartar sauce.
This car is electric. It evens out.
Actually, I had a whale of a time.
I caught him just so I could use the HOV lane.
I told you not to get so close when they're breaching.
Fine, I'll admit it. We should have gotten pet insurance.
how's about, for old time's sake, we, uh, pull over on one of these quiet country roads and, uh, hump... back there?
I promise honey, baleen has hundreds of uses.
So, Jonah, what did you say was eating you up recently?
I need the baleen.
Road kill! Beach kill! I'm bringing it home.
Is there something fishy you don't want to discuss?
Did you just....?
Krill out! It's just to the Arctic Circle and back!
It was your job to pack the krill.
Why does the car always smell like sardines?
From the ocean to our swimming pool...what's not "Catch and Release" about that?
SeaWorld's going-out-of-business sale left Tina with buyer's remorse.
Next year let's save an Alabama Cavefish.
He's still whalegating us?
Why do you always need to bring the pool toys to the beach.
You always said I exaggerated its size. Now you know.
Knock it off, Kevin. Nobody likes a backseat driver.
This guy puts the baleen in tailgating.
To be fair, this whole Uber driver thing was your idea...
The image on this back up camera is not realistic!
I forgot, they took krill off the menu at Stu's, how about Bistro On Main?
Do you think he has change for the toll?
We will make room on the wall
I just wish we could take one vacation that is not a fishing trip.
For the last time, we're not stopping at Red Lobster!
Do you know how hard it is to find a place that serves krill?
It's a little out of the way, but the krill is superb!
Well, you should have thought of that when we passed the rest stop near the tank a few miles back.
I didn't say it was 'free,' I said it was included with purchase.
Doris my dear, do you have any krill in your purse?
"I don't think save the whales means bringing them home with you"linda.
Don't look now but I think we're being swallowed.
I know it's a little tight in here, but he needed a ride and we needed a third to drive in the HOV lane.
It's the only way we could prove our fish story...
The whole idea of designer pets just really bothers me.
The elephant in the room was busy.
Let's count the different kinds of animals we see.
But you have to admit that he did make a big impression.
Costco trips used to be more fun than this,
Dammit Karen, I'm not trying to fishtail!
I told them "Krill" was a bad name for a car.
Why didn't you just go and buy some fish oil !
I think we need a bigger car
You're right. The convertible would have made more sense.
Hey, at least we saved money not renting a U-Haul...
Once we get him back in the water, we'll have a latte.
Okay, Ahab. Where do we go from here?
I'm sorry I liked the Cape and just wanted a souvenir.
Are you sure about the shrimp place?
Okay, it's not the best car wash, but it's the cheapest.
This was way more dramatic in the movie.
'nuff room back there?
I think it was attracted to our Save-The-Whales bumper sticker.
So I says "right Jonah, how is God going to get back at me, just let Him try"
No, it's not a hybrid like you wanted, but we really got a whale of a deal.
So...I heard Moby's new record is coming out soon.
I have an erudite classic literature reference you'll never see coming.
If the dog doesn't like it we can take him back.
Just remember, take out was your idea.
We got the bigger boat. Now I think we're going to need a bigger car
Can you please stop making those whale sounds.
Hey, it's hard to get a whale-sitter on short notice.
Can we not have plankton pie again for dinner?
You don't seem to care that I got a whale of a deal.
I think you're right. We should've gotten a rescue dog.
Whale... this is unusual.
Don't worry, Vegas will love this guy.
All Right, Have it Your Way--You Heard A Seal Bark.
When he told me he was "Going to whale on me!", I honestly thought he was kidding.
You were right. I'm not soothed at all by these whale sounds.
So you want to cancel our planned Safari for next year?
When was the last time we updated the GPS?
Honey, I swear . . . It was either krill or be krilled!
"Mammally." It smells really mammally in here.
99 planktons on the wall, 99 planktons...take one down, pass it around, 98 planktons on the wall...
Well who was the one who wanted to 'take him out for krill' in the first place?
Your family or mine?
It will be the freshest sushi you've ever tasted.
Well, this IS UberPool.
The new Volvo COMES with a roof rack.
I feel like we fish tailed around that las turn.
You think I should put the top down?
How far's the next rest stop? I really gotta blow!
'We're gonna need a bigger frying pan too!'
When we get to the car pool lane, I'll say Jonah's in there
I don't care if you did yell, "shotgun" first.
Well. It was cheaper than a beach house.
Car salesmen don't lie---he gave us a whale of a deal!
5 percent! 10 percent! I don't care if it's on sale! We don't need another sperm whale!
You did it with Titanic last week, now it's my favourite scene reenactment time.
I just feel like I'm heading into the belly of the beast, you know?
Is this what you meant by "Save the whales"?
I wanted to volunteer for a good cause. Apparently, Save The Whales is all about user engagement this year.
Call Moby, tell him put more krill on the grill.
Once again, you're ignoring the elephant in the room.
I prefer sperm white to a baby beluga interior.
Thanks for not nagging me about the krill.
Rising sea levels my eye!
You have to admit, we'll have a whale of a story!
If we don't tell him the baleen fairy doesn't exist soon, were going to run out of quarters
Can we please stop listening to Moby?
What good is our pond if it isn't stocked?
We're going to have a problem getting him a seatbelt.
I bet your dad will be surprised when he sees my catch !
She's hitching to Nantucket and it's on our way.
Maybe we should just stick with salmon fishing.
And you said a convertible wasn't practical.
What? The compact was 10 bucks cheaper.
Being on vacation doesn't mean you cant do a little cooking.
I told you we should have adopted a penguin.
Just because he doesn't understand human speech doesn't mean you can talk behind his back.
Sorry for blubbering...
When you said your Mom was a whale I just thought you had a really porr relation ship with her
Just think of it as Jonah's revenge!
It's like uber, but for impractically large sea mammals.
Just krill me.
Well, no more vacations for us. After this it's just going to be Netflix and krill.
Shall we clean the sperm out of the backseat?
Did you ask for the receipt?
Think of it as an opportunity to test the effectiveness of that little cardboard pine tree...
So, this is your idea of a quiet vacation without the kids?
Didn't you bring the shrink wrap?
It's just a whale in the car honey, don't make it an elephant in the room...
But you told me to take the next Right.
I was thinking, little by little, on the outdoor grill
You were the one who wanted ALL the options.
We go much faster during high tide.
The lease says nothing about whales.
I know they're intelligent but I assumed that they would prefer Melville over Kerouac.
What do you mean "We just saved a whale" is debatable?
I'm supposed to just leave it there? Do you have any idea what blubber is going for?
We should have taken the Hudson River.
Anything for carpool.
What can I tell you? He said he was sick of seafood, and wanted to go out for a steak dinner instead.
You are missing the scenery honey
Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to catch a fish and you feed him for a lifetime.
Forgive *me* for wanting to carpool.
Fuel economy is just terrible with this car
I never know how much to order when I take out sushi.
You asked for a whale of a time.
Have you guys heard the one about the humpback trapped in a hatchback?
How was I to know that it literally was a whale of a deal on seafood?
Okay, I won't pick up any more hitchhikers.
There was something different about that whale watch
It's hard to steer when he comes along.
Uber carpool totally worth the discount...
Why am I the freak when you are the one who wanted to try a threesome in the first place?
They didn't get a good response from the last whale contest so they gave it to us.
When you said you had one of those new Eco cars that saves the environment, this isn't what I was thinking.
They're filter feeders so they really cut the emissions, but they're hell on gas mileage.
I told you the new "Volvo ZXXX" wagon had plenty of cargo space.
See dear, I told you it would fit in the car.
And you said getting a comvertible was irresponsible
What's wrong? Krill doesn't sound good to you?
I don't like SeaWorld either but this is ridiculous.
Did the sign say 'Last krill for 300 miles'?
You need to work on your need to collect souvenirs.
Great uncle Ahab would have wanted it this way.
Don't know what your thinking but I'm guessing a 1,000 fish sticks. Maybe more!
Look, we'll save on everything else we buy at Costco this year.
So what? He didn't spout this time.
I feel like sardines.
Did you use MapQuest again?
But it was on sale. I know how you love sales.
Go ahead and say it, Margot. I'm an ass!
We should of let it go.
But it's gluten-free!
No, the dispatch app does not specify species.
I've had him since he was a baby. Funny... his favorite thing to do on weekends is when we go to the car wash. You know those plastic cleaning strips? They remind him of his mother.
Got a whale of a deal on this used car!
Oh boy, no more fish sticks!
Could you please give the baby her bottle, she's whaling.
I hope you know this will be reflected in your passenger rating.
He wants us to stop at a fast food place and order some algae.
I got it from a New Yorker cartoon.
"I didn't want to talk about the one that got away".
The important thing is to keep our heads above water.
The GPS always takes me across the bay.
Spare wheel? I thought you said to bring a spare whale
I knew we should have gotten a puppy.
What do you think the kids are feeding it?
oh fuck
Should our invitations read fish fry or mammal roast?
We forgot to ask what to feed him.
What do you think he wants for dinner?
For once, I'm the cool dad . . . the one who brings home a porpoise!
I disagree, hun. If Suze Orman knew me well enough, she would say I really did "need" a humpback whale.
We should really make a point to come out to the Dive-In Theater more often.
I think he signed-up for the wrong carpool.
I should have taken that recall of defective airbags more seriously.
Look. Garage sale whales are not that easy to find anymore.
This is the last time I rent a car from USS Enterprise.
We're gonna need a bigger back seat.
Is that ambergris you're wearing?
uberPOOL has officially expanded into the Pacific.
I think this was a whale of a bad idea!
I think this is really going to affect our gas mileage.
I'm no therapist, but if you are carrying around this much damage I think you need to sea kelp...
What, no water bottles back here?! Oh, you are definitely getting one star in my Uber review.
I'm going to deal with it as soon as I get rid of the elephant in the room.
You have to admit, it was a whale of a deal.
I thought we got a hatchback, too.
This will be quite a whale of a tale.
'Getting the backup camera is the best decision I ever made.'
This way we can watch it every day at home.
Yeah, but now when I say it was this big, they'll have to believe me.
drive-thru sushi?
truth is, he caught us, he just hasn't eaten us yet
My guess is the aquariun won't hold it.
If it weren't for the ambergris I'd just as soon have a dog.
I'm beginning to wonder about all that plankton you put in the trunk.
My cat's really mad at me right now.
OK, so it isn't a whale that's tailgating me.
I know you don't like my brother, but who else has a pool?
I spy with my little eye something that is large.
The driver behind us is a real blowhole.
Stop wailing. We are almost there.
The ad said "a whale of a deal" not "a deal of a whale."
Is his seat belt on?
Tailfins -- retrochique.
I'm tellin' ya--I smell krill.
Porche Whale Tail - there is no substitute
We're out of floss again.
I hope you remember what you wanted all that baleen for before we get home.
Trust me -- this'll get us to Honolulu an hour earlier.
I've been trying to shake him for years. He just keeps pursuing me obsessively.
Who keeps playing with the rear view mirror?
Right now that's not the question.
And you did tell this new school we won't tolerate any bullying about his weight?
But it said 'calf - just weaned' in the add...
I thought we were looking for Nemo.
I think it'll go faster as sashimi---not nigiri.
You think this will make a difference? Your fishing buddies will still think you are exaggerating.
Gosh, don't you just hate whalegaters?
Okay, I'll admit you were right. We should have put him in the kennel!
Well, I think the ending of Finding Dory was completely plausible.
Told you she was a great catch, we met online.
Would you stop wailing about my driving?
This isn't just another fish tale.
I told you why. The aardvark didn't come in blue.
This car is safe, it came with the jaws of life.
Don't worry, I heard him say it's enough for six.
It doesn't emit carbon dioxide like those nasty petroleum fuels. You see, this new sustainable whale oil burns much more clean.
Is the air alright? Let me know if you get hot back there.
You have a very large imagination, honey.
They're tailing us.
That's not your mother in the backseat?
Ok, I admit I am not a marine biologist either.
I was sure that officer said he was issuing me a “citation.”
This may sound crazy, but now I feel like we are being watched by a whale.
This is why I always wanted a pickup truck.
NOW would you agree that a sunroof might be nice?
We should have stayed with Costco!
I just don't trust these cars that park for you.
Do you still think a pickup truck is a bad idea?
I think we have a fluke!
I think someone's whale-gating us.
Maybe we should stop the small talk and address the whale in the room.
He's a killer whale. We should get a reward for him.
I told you this would be a whale of a commute.
I take it this is not what you expected when I invited you to join me on a whale watching trip.
Next time, please request an UberXL.
If it doesn't fit, we can always take it back.
You don't exactly seem to be having a whale of a time.
It's time we talked about the whale in the car.
But honey, his sign said 'Pequod or bust'.
I knew those "Sushi Shack" coupons would come in handy.
I don't think that's what they intended by "Car Pool Lane".
What should we call him?
In my defense, it was a whale of a sale.
Nothing I do, big or small impresses you!
I told you that buying a hatchback would come in handy.
Couldn't you just have bought a mug or fudge?
Okay, you win; I'll take him back.
It's the prototype for using echolocation in it's front collision braking system
I think we should save Plankton, not whales!
Do you have enough room back there?
Got enough room back there?
We're fine. He's a krill eater.
Your idea of a beach souvenir is just weird.
What? The kids promised they'd clean up after it.
I'll be glad when Jonah can stay home alone.
How about a little beluga tonight?
I was hoping to show you a whale of a good time.
Fill 'er up with biofuel you said.
the folks at PETA said I needed to work on my street cred
Obviously, its GPS needs reprogramming!
Did you put a towel first?
It's called the car-pool lane.
Why did you have to go and supersize your whopper meal?
Maybe we should have gone with the snow tires.
Hey, he just darted out in front of me I and I didn't see him until it was too late!
I know your story Jonah, but what's His?
But if you prorate the money over its entire lifetime, the costs are really quite reasonable.
Yeah... like we would be going any faster if we were towing this 300,000 lb. blue whale with your car.
If we do this right, Starship Enterprise can stay where it belongs.
You promised me a whale of a good time, but this is ridiculous!
He'll never learn without watching me do it first.
Sorry, there was a speed hump back there
I don't need to ask for directions.
Can't tell a fish tale without proof.
I told you that twelve-pound test line would be enough.
Ant other bright ideas, Ahab?
Have you ever thought about being a sperm doner?
She couldn't resist my "Songs of the Deep" CD last week at Venice Beach
And I thought the worst thing that could ever have happened to me was that time the elephant was in the living room.
Hatchback? I thought you said "Humpback"... besides, his baleen is an excellent oil filter: he spent the last 6 years training in the Gulf of Mexico...
I feel like a fish out of water in this thing.
For the bouillabaisse a pound of saffron will do.
You and your "Pick up that poor hitchhiker" syndrome.
It's an all terrain model.
I think we should drop him at the next beach, our mileage has gone to hell.
Sure it stinks, but at just 5 cents per pound thats smell we can learn to live with.
And then you said, "We're going on vacation, why would we need the pickup truck?"
Hey you have to say, that was one whale of a ride!
okay, next time I'll read the fine print on the "magic" lure
Listen. We got a hatchback for a reason.
An elephant in the room? No, I don't think so. Why do you ask?
Well, I got tired of "elephant in the room".
He's a refugee from Sea World.
I did not expect such a small trunk.
The shocks on this car are horrible.
Couldn't we have just gotten a goldfish?
They weren't kidding when they said 'Whale of a Sale'.
I am aware whales have backbones, Bob, but I need you to slide down a bit further.
"It's powered by sperm oil".
He says he got the idea from reading A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
Look, we can hire someone to clean and filet it.
Doesnt this tailgater know we're all dying to get to the beach?
Worms, minnows, lures............. no one will believe we talked it in with a promise of a better life.
I know I said no hitchhikers, but I thought I'd make an exception in this case.
Taking him to the off leash whale park.
Maybe we should just foster him.
It's your turn to get krill.
Do you think this is enough for you to practice rolling sushi?
This was one whale of a vacation . . .
Yes, the ad said, "Help rescue a whale," and this is what we are doing. Any questions?
But I like Bob Marley and the Wailers!
I told you we should have bought a full-size.
We parked on the beach too long.
Well, it makes one hell of an airbag.
He's too big to throw back!
I'll bet you the vet will charge us 150.00 just to tell us that a gallon of mint flavored mouthwash will cure his baleen breath.
I thought we were going whale watching!
Think of it as a conversation piece!
Can we just agree to disagree?
I knew we shouldn't have watched 'Free Willy' before coming to SeaWorld.
Because she said "shotgun" first
Your Puns Are Krilling Me.
And you didn't think the whalegate option was a good idea.
You'll see, in a few years there will be a Krill station on every corner.
But you said you wanted a big dick.
No, I definitely heard a seal bark.
Is there something you need to tell me dear?
I told you, I've just always wanted one!
Do you think people will believe us about the one that got away?
I'm going the speed limit. Let him tailgate.
Keep your eyes peeled for a Long John Silver's.
Research
Do you think we would've been better off renting the Jaguar?
The dealer said that the back seat could hold a whale
Hey, you're the one that told me I had to do something about the krill situation
Did you hear? Tailfins are coming back.
You wanna list it on Ebay or Etsy?
So sue me for trying to save money on the ferry.
You're not exactly having a whale of a good time, are you?
Are all the seat belts buckled ?
Should we serve red or white with it?
Do you feel a sprinkle? I'd better close the sunroof.
Ok, Mr. Aey Hab, now what?
Did you have Broccoli for lunch?
For God's sake, Ishmael, I told you not to feed it.
It's not just for Porsches any more.
I'll admit, this wasn't the best investment.
Now the girls will never guess we were actually at a strip club!
No more picking up hitchhikers.
It's the only way I can ride in the HOV lane.
Good grief, Harry! Did you want me to just leave the poor thing in there to drown?
Happy now that you can meet your minimum daily fish oil requirement?
OK, so I haven't quite perfected the release part of catch-and-release.
Of course there's nothing fishy here. It's a mammal.
Yes, the trip is long, but do I have a whale of a tale to tell you!
Blubber is way better for the environment than petroleum.
Todd, for the hundredth time, I am not calling you Ishmael.
We're not talking about the elephant in the room. Okay!
The neighbors got a dolphin.
Dogs are great but I like to stand out.
Our engine sounds fishy
Hatch! I ordered the hatchback!
Call me Ishmael! Buying this new Chevy Pequod from Ahab Motors was a BIG mistake!
If you said now "we literally had a whale of a time, that would be the correct usage."
You're the one who wanted to listen to Moby.
I said we needed an efficient car not a fish in a car!
My insurance company called it a fluke of nature.
I had a whale of a time.
I don't know about you, but I had a whale of a time today.
In retrospect, it appears there are some problems with using krill oil as fuel.
Nothing worse than a backseat diver.
Cut me some slack, I wasn't that close to the water.
I hate tailgaters.
Was this the first step for your grandmother's homemade gefilte fish?
Did we leave the lights on at the house?
They will have to call "US" Ishmael.
This time I'm really not crying wolf. Seriously, look behind you. There's a whale on our trunk.
Well, there's not another Asian deli between here and the Canadian border that has any okiami left to sell, so I'm open to ideas.
We are NOT lost.
Seriously, I would have heard if you said to get a goldfish.
Elephant in the room? Whale in the car" What's the difference?
I thought we'd done well to get past the elephant
When you promised a whale of a trip, this isn't what I pictured.
OK, maybe there are easier ways to fuel our oil lamps.
Dare I say it--you're having a whale of a good time?
Jonah, we're driving him from Chicago to L.A. Then he's taking you from L.A. to Honolulu.
Okay, I agree that Eileen isn't the greatest travel companion. But who would feed her while we're on vacation?
You're father insisted on a chaperone.
Great sonar navigation, besides the penchant for school routes
I guess its whale sandwiches in my lunch-box for rest of the year!
Next time for cocktails at the Rosenfelds, what say we leave Moby home?
Not another bathroom stop !
Ok, you were right. Minced garlic on his plankton was a bad idea.
Whale? What whale?
You're right, it does smell fresher in here.
BIGGER than they appear?!
One of us gets out to confront it, and it's not gonna be me.
That's a years supply of sushi!
You didn't happen to have krill for lunch, did you?
Well, I guess that's the last time they'll have all-you-can-eat krill.
No, you can't keep it even if it did follow you home.
Admit it. We had a whale of a good time.
I thought that eating muktuk was on your bucket list.
I think this is the wrong kind deposit to the sperm bank, honey!
Now aren't you glad we got a convertible?
Okay, not in the house. I'll hang him in the garage.
I am not fishtailing, I am driving in a perfectly straight line!
really Alice, don't you think ordering fish and chips is a bit insensitive when our hitch hiker friend is struggling to find himself without the threat of having tartar sauce thrown in his face.
Oh, quit whaling!
Mascot tryouts in Hartford is your big idea?
Global warming may be a fact,
I swear, if I hear one more baleen joke . . .
I have think this counts toward reducing our carbon footprint.
You always do this!!
The bumper sticker says, "Save the whales" not free rides for whales.
I knew this convertible would come in handy.
Do you think we should put its seat belt on?
But didn't you say you wanted something really spectacular as the centerpiece of the rehearsal dinner?
But you said you wanted take out!
No, he does NOT want you to call him "Ishmael".
I still don't think I should have gotten a ticket. Where else was I going to put it?
Do you want to come up for a drink?
This is a "two if by sea" ride.
Now we can drive in the Ultra-HOV lane
Sure, it's great using the carpool lane - but I can't get the smell of krill out of the upholstery.
next time we need to get a four door...a two door just doesn't fit our family needs
Save the whales! Now we only need a hump back to have a complete set!
Quick -- Google 'whale rescue'
Did we really need that Krill oil on sale at Costco?
You have really taken your "Save the Whales" passion a little too far.
Not back seat diver...back seat driver!
SeaWorld is really taking advantage of UberPOOL.
See, I told you Costco literally has everything.
It isn't my sperm...
I know cars are not your thing dear, but I just love our new auto pilot.
Well, THAT was a whale of a time!
So, where does one get 8,000 pounds of krill?
Jonah?...Who's Jonah?
No, I specifically heard you say that you were going to pack his Krill.
I just remembered my taillight is out...
I think we are going to need a bigger car
..but think of all the electricity we'll save.
I know. They said legroom wasn't a problem.
It's amphibious, you know, like James Bond's.
Now that we've addressed the elephant in the corner, is there something else you'd like to tell me?
I know you wanted an Eco-Friendly car..but this is ridiculous.
Really, he said 'Call me Uber'?
Tell them the truth?
Yes, but there isn't anything better for flossing than baleen.
Hey, you were they one that wanted fresh sushi.
It's a short cut.........trust me.
This is not what I meant by having a whale of a time.
Do I look like Melville?
Thanks for riding with Uber.
Trust me, it will make a whale of a story
Second place in "The Voice", what were they thinking!?
Guess I can't hang this one over the mantle.
When I said I wanted a newer car to help save our animal friends,this is not what I had in mind.
So have you talked to the therapist about the whales you've been seeing?
Would it be cliche to suggest Starbucks?
Like I said, it is not a fish, it smells like a fish, it swims like a fish, and it lives in the ocean, but we already have a dog so this one is going back.
Orca whales don't bloviate and they are not ignoramuses.
This will be a whale of a tail.
I told you you'd have a whale of a time.
I don't understand how switching to a whale-oil car is going to save us money in the long-term...
Honey, I told him I wanted a tune-up, not a tuna!
I'm glad we went with the sport package.
You know it's very inconsiderate to Stanley when you say you feel like a beached whale.
Whale Gating?
Our gas mileage sucks !!!
You wanted a plankton green Mini.
Think about it. It will feed the koi for years. We can use the baleen as an air filter. I can do scrimshaw and the kids can have something to show and tell at school. So what if there is a little smell.
Maybe you could call Ish and tell him we’ll be on time for the surprise party after all.
Let's try a smaller fishing rod next time.
The left taillight is out again
Bob, I said I wanted to go deep sea DIVING, not deep sea DRIVING.
Look, I understand why you didn't want to deal with in the elephant in the room, but this is getting ridiculous.
Honey, I'm sure we can get a good price on krill if we buy in bulk.
So then my fishmonger says....."they're cheaper by the ton".
Honey, I hate to tell you but your breath really stinks.
I said a whale is tailgating us. And no. I don't know if it's an endangered species.
Do you really expect me to believe another one of your fish stories?
Well it's not like we could just leave him there. Have you even seen Blackfish?
No, I don't recall you mentioning your great uncle Ahab before. Why?
They were definitely fat-shaming me back there!
Let me guess. A tail gate party in Miami.
Don't like my horn? What if I don't like your complex song?
Don't be a hypocrite, you've taken strays home before.
Something tells me we're going to need an overweight permit to cross the Verrazano–Narrows Bridge.
Remember Romney, Senator!
Hey, you in the back. Put your seat belt on.
No, seriously! He says Seaworld has changed their ways.
Can you not play Moby, right now?
Feel like fish for dinner tonight?
Sigh, just another whale of a tale.
We need to add air to the rear tires
You sure the fraternity has a pool?
Well, the salesman was wright you know...it fits.
Something's fishy.
What's eating you?
This is what happens when you ignore the 800 pound gorilla in the room.
Whale Oil is an alternative source of Energy, Sarah. At least we're not using Fossil Fuels!
I bet you are re-thinking that coupe versus convertible decision now, huh?
So, tell me more about your dream.
This is waaaaayyyy bigger than Sharknado.
Cheer up. We're going to have a whale of a time.
"Krillin it with the Big Kahuna" is not what I heard.
Got a breath mint for the back seat diver?
You gotta love a Subaru.
Wait - you thought I said third wheel?
No, I'm not gonna stop. He may not be a killer whale, but who's to say he isn't some other kind of felony whale?
I need to pee. Can you quickly run in and see if they have a 400-lb. bag filled with fish, crabs and plankton?
Sounds like a whale's tale to me.
OK, you were right. "Krill" is not a good brand name for a small car.
Well, at least he's not whale-gating.
For the last time, I'm not gonna pull over until he puts his siren on.
Okay, you've got your fish story, let's get home.
Can we un-adopt her? Can't put my seat back, and her breath.
My caption entry came in fourth.
This thing with the new eco-cars have gone too far.
I don't know why, but I have a whale of a headache.
Again Jonah?
We should probably krill up the tank sooner than later
What's with you? You said it was my turn to choose a pet.
Come on... We're gonna have a whale of a time!
Maybe we shouldn't have tried to run away from the elephant in the room.
The perfect hostess gift for the Ahabs.
OK. You don't want my mother to come.
How in Hell do we pan-fry this thing?
I told you the seat belt was too small. Now we have to throw the damn thing back.
You just had to say, hop in!
But, he has such good stories!
I can't help feeling that our surf and turf dinner is still with us.
I agree, we don't seem to be on the same page anymore
It's either this or we wait until he evolves to walk on land again.
So I'm gonna go ahead and rate you 5 stars right now.
"I just wish he'd stop calling me Ahab." (My apologies. This is not a DUP submission. I mistakenly entered caption #535 with a typo and am simply re-submitting it from my wife's computer. Tnx.)
That's the problem with these coastal roads - the whalegaters.
It was just a dream, Jonah.
This wasn't what I had in mind when the dealership said it comes with a whale tail.
I found it particularly odd that not one person at the party mentioned the huge elephant in the room.
It was better than a great deal!
Honey, if that's a police flasher, I will do all the talking.
From all the whale watches we could have gone on, we pick a boat that doesn’t spot a single whale!
The car feels a little sluggish today, no?
I'm so over Uber pool.
I've seen tailgating but one more foot and we will be swallowed.
Fish obstructing view, at least the Judge will laugh!
Next time we're just going to Whole Foods
I told you we should have gotten an SUV.
I'm not the one who insists we stop at every copepod stand we see.
I like to bring my own entertainment to the beach.
OK, OK, so we'll get another refrigerator.
I thought I signed up for Uber pool, not Uber ocean.
It may be difficult to find a krill diner at this hour.
You're the one who said we should try Waze.
I beg to differ...it's not the smell of baleen... but ambergris.
I promised you a whale of a time.
I told you that agreeing to carpool with the Beluga's was a bad idea.
Care to come back to my place for a bite to eat?
I don't usually pick up hitchhikers, but ...
That's odd. This is the second whale I've seen in a month.
The extra $5500 for the convertible model doesn't seem so bad now.
Didn't I tell you that Right Whales are docile?

You and your cut-rate humanitarian projects.
Yes, honey, I'm pretty sure that was the Natural History Museum's gift shop
Did I miss the boat ramp?
I don't care how rare he is, he is riding my tail!
Are you sure that you want to start your own cosmetics line?
Getting hungry?
Honey, I think maybe this was a bad idea.
You wouldn't need to bring proof every time if you would only stop crying wolf and telling tall tales, John!
I thought that sign said Deer Crossing!
Remind me next time we get the car washed to NOT ask for Krill scented freshener.
You know honey, we really oughta think about downsizing our souvenir selection next time.
Consumer Reports mentioned the lack of space in the back seat but I don't really agree.
What do mean, endangered species list?
See? There were no 'harmful' effects of pouring nuclear waste into that lake. Sure it made the commute worse, but tourism has skyrocketed!
Did you ever get to finish reading Moby Dick?
He's already started and we're still 2300 miles from the ocean.
Convertibles and fishing; not a good combination
isn't this the one from that other caption contest?
Door prize for first ten patrons at Aquarium World this weekend!!!
I wish you could imagine just how uncomfortable I feel around your friends.
The guy at Carvel claims I said, "To feed 400"!
When you told me we're going to help to save the whales I thought we'd just wright (wright whale) them a check.
Ever since I married you, things have been very fishy.
Flossing seems unwise. We need something ... Curiously Strong.
Jonah, can you get out and see what that noise is back there.
I did not give him HGH fish food.
It's not a fish! Look at the fluke, its flat and he's breathing air right now!
'You know it's a long way back to Iowa.'
I'was "adoption free" at the pet store.
Whale? What do you have to say for yourself?
I don't smell anything. What? You think I did it?
Where's Krill?
One more word and it's back to the island for you
Stop acting like a fish out of water.
Sushi or lamb for dinner...you choose.
You were supposed to face it towards the rear.
He begged me to take him to his pod reunion.
You know, on Porsches, whale tails are a desirable option.
So it landed on the car when I started talking whale. Why do you say that's a fluke?
Are you sure we have a fish tank large enough?
It was supposed to be a fun trip, why is everyone so blue today?
Honey, did you remember to feed the fish?
It's going to be a whale of a story if we get pulled over.
My car. My playlist. End of discussion.
Trust me, it's all stuff that matters!
Proof that online dating is fishy.
Did you hear a blowhole?
Never drive a convertible through a tropical rainstorm.
You have to admit, it was a whale of a catch
I think Japan's car industry is trying too hard after the fuel scandal.
Let's stop for sushi.
This is really going to be a "Whale of a Tale"!
If you don't like the way I'm driving well you can just stay at the beach.
Now he wants squid? Well, that does it. We have to tell your mother that we're done babysitting for Ahab.
It will never fit in the freezer
OK, I admit it. We're lost! Should I ask "him" for directions?
Do you take everything so literal?
Is this your bad dream, or mine?
I told you Mexico wouldn't take him.
We should get one of those rear view mirror pine trees.
How did I know he could cross the road?
I need to get my hearing checked. I keep hearing cousin Jonah.
I feel like there is a sea between us. Whale you tell me what is wrong?
It was 'Catch and Release.' Yea, I forgot the 'Release' part.
I'm fine with you picking up the odd down-on-their-luck hitchhiker but I have to draw the line at fish hiking.
Yes, Mildred, I had a whale of a time...
Moby's going to college. We're empty-nesters.
Don't think great white, think great millage
Nobody likes a back-seat diver.
I didn't ask for one of those
No, a convertible would not have helped in this situation.
Hey Ishmael, it's me, Moby. I'm back and ready to rumble.
Really--I heard you say that we should take advantage of this 'Whale of a Sale'!
You should've went before we left the beach.
Yes, I'll let you out on the Pacific side of the road.
Even the tires are made of blubber.
Now, what were you saying about not picking up hitchhikers?
Aww, c'mon. It was a mistype. Beluga caviar... Beluga in a car... Either way it was a whale of first date!
Are we sure about home birthing?
So do you want to 'fish story' me again?
My wife says these new cars are my white whale.
When I said "let's have a whale of a time", this wasn't what I had in mind.
This check-up for dental cleaning better not take longer than a week.
Oh, it's just another one of those annoying tailgators.
Woody Allen was right. The New York Aquarium is restricted.
Enough of your Kirk Douglas obsession! This is embarrassing.
Why do you keep sniffing? Why is this car slowing down? Why did I ever marry you?
Sushi tonight?
Seriously, a transoceanic relocation program to save the whales?
Well, you said you wanted some Beluga!
Beginner's luck, do it again next Sunday, honey?
did you just fart?
When we bought the car they assured us it was "Dolphin Safe"
No. I said they are a lot worse than crabs.
It's one thing to chase us, but what does he think he's gonna do if he actually catches us?
SeaWorld's clearance sale -- what a catch!
After krill, a ride in the convertible is his next favorite thing.
I hope you stocked up on krill capsules.
Well, look on the bright side...We're taking home a whale of a tail.
He said it was a whale of a deal...!
He's fine out of the water, but not so well on long trips.
Let's use my uncle the adoption agent, she said.
I just know the people at Sea World will find out that you snuck this out under your blouse.
You should have thought of that before.
You were just complaining that we didn't have enough to fill that second freezer
got plankton?
So, is my whale of a tail story boring you?
I am uneasy about transporting a whale across State lines.
My mechanic's been in the oil business a long time.
Stick you head out the window and tell him we're not the world's biggest plankton.
I just felt so bad for Charlie--never being chosen... . I just had to do something about it.
Evolution happens
The next vacation hire someone to feed your pet fish.
What do you mean there's no return policy?
I told the auto club to send the big tow truck.
Can you believe someone just dumped him on the side of the road?
Going to adopt-a-pet at Sea World may not have been a great idea.
Bad on us, we should have brought the SUV.
No one will believe this fish story
I'm going to have to orcastrate a left turn soon.
I told you. I'm a method actor and I am playing Captain Ahab!
"I got me a car, it's as big as a whale." Next stop, the Love Shack!
Is that all you got, the fillet sandwich?
Looks like dinner tonight is more 'surf' than 'turf'.
This was not the whale tail option I had in mind.
Takata airbags always smell like krill.
Well, I'm sorry, too, but he looked too cramped at the aquarium.
I promise you I'll have it ready for your bouillabaisse.
If everybody did, but not everybody will.
It'll be fine Sarah, he said he knew my great-grandfather, Ahab.
Whadda ya mean, free meals? We'll have to buy a new freezer.
The guys said join a carpool, it will be fun.
I don't see what the big deal is. We used to do this all the time when I was a teenager in Reykjavík..
I'm making sushi tonight.
You'd think SeaWorld would have learned their lesson by now.
We get better mileage with the elephant in the room.
It is called fishing you know?
There is no way his father was a sardine!
I really don't see how you could have heard 'sale'.
And you thought the elephant was bad.
Whale what do you know, it fit.
I'm sorry. I forgot the Aquarium was closed today!
I told you -- if you want the navigation system you have to get the humpback. It's part of the package.
He turns into a were-whale whenever they play Brittney Spears.
Tell me again, why are we still saving this?
That’s one whale of an air freshener.
I got it on sale—it was a whale of a deal.
What? I told you it was aquatically diverse carpool.
So why did you think I bought a convertible?
Fine. I'll say it if it'll make you happy: 'You're right, Honey, we should've at least rented the hatchback'. There. OK?
He made a request to ride sharing.
I get excellent mileage with whale oil, but yes, finding a filling station can sometimes be a problem.
That was awesome seeing The Heart of the Sea in 3D, I could almost smell the ambergris
I just don't care if it was a whale of a deal anymore.
Yeah? Well, you're the one who wanted me to teach a man to fish.
I don't think this complies with state fish and game regulations.
Sperm BANK? I thought you said sperm TANK!
Margaret, does something smell fishy to you?
I wish they'd do something about that pothole!
How much longer till we get there?
You're right, we should have rented the SUV.
Want to help me clean it ??
Seriously, with the rain, that was quite a fishtail back there.
I'm glad you've finally become a marine biologist, but do we have to take him on our vacation to Maine?
Have you considered the consequences of buying the one without a sun roof?
I believe it's your week to plan the menu!
I'm trying to incorporate more fish into my routine.
When I said your mother was a whale, I was just trying to be honest.
They should have warned us about the "adult size" of this species.
Settle down, or you're going back in your car seat!
I told you not to pick up hitchhikers so close to Sea World!
Okay, I think we need to address the whale in the car.
This traffic is krilling me!
At least ours doesn't wail.
Does it rhyme with Schmoby Schmick?
Great mileage, but I'm not completely sold on the plankton-powered car just yet.
I need to get the car in for that airbag recall
This is a Chevy "Plankton"? For real?
Of course I still support 'Save The Whales,' I just don't have any money for a U-Haul.
The one who smelt it dealt it.
Your whale dreams are so vivid.
I told you I love the taste of fish
This will turn our pool cleaning service up a notch.
And yet, he hates when I stick the vacuum's hose down his blowhole.
Something is fishy here.
No, clean diesels just feel like that.
Let me guess, don't tell mom?
Does our policy cover whale damage?
What about some songs of the deep to go with?
So I had one too many shrimp cocktails--so sue me.
Yes, but buying at the big box store, we saved 25 cents a pound!
"Something smells fishy." Very funny. Ha ha ha.
Is this what it’s like to have a whale of a time?
It's just when you said you wanted to pick up Moby Dick from the store this isn't what I had in mind.
Stop complaining. I told you that I would clean it.
Did I tell you it weighs three tons?
They all said you were a great catch.
Wait, what do you mean I'm 'overcompensating through my aquarium'?
I'm not getting sushi with you anymore.
Yes I was thinking of you when I bought it.
You look as though there's a peoblem.
You're worse than the Japanese when it comes to whaling.
We're heading on down to the Love Shack
I don't know about you dear, but I had a whale of a good time.
It did fit in the car, so maybe getting new a pet wasn’t such a bad idea. I still think we’re going to need a bigger bathtub though.
I'm telling you, the trademark attorney cleared "McSushi."
I know. But he's white!
Jonah's asleep in the back seat. Just heard him gurgle.
The guys will never believe this one!
Why is it we get stuck with the least talented of "The New Yorker's" cartoonists?
It's a Moby Mobile
I repeat "it will be mounted on the family room wall "
I can't lose him; better turn off the Whale Love Songs CD.
And you thought we didn't need a back seat.
I told you "Honk if you love krill" was a bad bumper sticker!
It takes regular gas but gets spermeceti oil changes.
I just shifted "I've just shifted from sport to the Eco mode."
Okay, just one more large marine mammal and then I'll stop for directions.
I can't believe this traffic.
I told you 100 times, we shouldn't have named our son Jonah.
Quick ... wake up ... and don't act like krill.
Broach, breach. I still don't want to talk about it.
So - what's your favorite car song?
We should've looked at the materials list before we let him sign on for advanced placement marine biology.
Next time I'm not dealing your class pet.
I told you we should have opted for the pre-purchase inspection.
What do you mean you don't want it? I don't want it! What am I going to do with a whale?
Low on gas, out of food. Look for a Fill and Krill.
We have to hide him from captivity.
Bob hated having a backseat diver.
You can't imagine the thrill of fighting a really big fish.
Is this your idea of a whale of a time?
Well, the car salesman said it was a whale of a deal.
I swear this is the last time I uber pool.
No, I'm not obsessed, I'm just saying Moby should have won that Grammy!
Look, Mae, you do want the kids back, don't you?
Ok. Next time I'll ask for directions.
Yes, I understand we use more gasoline, but since I joined Green Peace, it's the only way I feel guilt free driving.
Okay, you win! We'll give it to your mother.
They were here first.
It's for scientific research, Bob
The ales! The ales! Not 'the whales'!
Now Who Da Man, Meslissa?
Yeah, I really liked the coupe, but I felt for me the four-door would just be more practical.
The working title is "Final Flop".
But honey! That's what fishing's all about!
I knew your phishing would catch up to you eventually
Where are we? I cannot find any pokemons
No one will know I didn't harpoon it.
Did you remember to bring your juke box money for the Love Shack?
How about pizza? Chinese? Just not seafood, please?
The kids have been asking for a pet.
I suppose it's time for a bigger freezer.
I'm waiting to back up until she opens her mouth.
Why do you always insist on picking up hitchhikers?
Ever since you got that job at Sea World, the car has had a fish smell.
So, Porsche's 911 "whale tail" spoiler has nothing on this baby; go big or go home, right?
Stan is the worst backseat diver.
Look at it this way - we'll always have a whale of a tale.
No more cock and bull about the one that got away.
Did you get the auto rental insurance?
at least we don't have to cross any international borders.
I think Ishamel'd better call US.
It's not as if we'reigniring the elephant in the room
What do you mean, "too literal" ?
I thought the whale was supposed to turn this into a good time.
Maybe the story wasn't so big.
It's called 'one-click' purchasing, if you've heard of that.
I told you" Mr. know it all "that it would be too big for our garden pond
Honey, is that you singing or is it coming from the car?
Can we stop to swim again?
Admit it you two. This has been quite the adventure.
JOSH, so when you dropped out of school and said you were helping save endangered species it didn't mean you could bring them home like a suitcase!!!
" I told you we should have brought the station wagon".
We sure had a good time, didn't we?
Well, we had a real whale of a time!
I heard "a whale OF a prize"!
Well our son Jonah said he wanted a pet.
This isn't the type of Carpooling I had in mind.
You clearly said it was the right whale!
Look at that punim. I couldn't push him back in.
I really like the new car smell of the Barricuda.
The mileage isn't great but it rates off the charts on its rear end collision safety scores
Boy, that was one whale of a fender bender.
Now let me show you how to operate the front wipers.
What? I told you I'm an ÜberCetacean driver.
Not everyone loves Marineland.
We have a whale of a problem and its not going away on its own.
I wonder how long sashimi stays fresh!
We should stop picking up hitchhikers...
I think we're beached.
You could at least admit that at 29 I'm over Ahab's dilemma.
This happens when you don't talk about the elephant.
Sorry for the delay honey, I came straight back from the wharf.
When I heard there was going to be a garage sale at Sea World I knew we had to get there early.
Wake up honey.........I think i'm in your dream!
Hey, you were the one who wanted fish tonight.
But honey, you said we could get a new pet.
It's the major reason I bought the car. If you wanna save the whales, you need a giant trunk.
I think we're gonna need a bigger car.
I do not like your idea of a shopping for natural, organic food for dinner at the source.
You said we'd experience marine encounters. I wasn't anticipating this!
Honey, what time does the krill store close?
Shall we stop by the Jones's on our way home?
I don't care how much funding you got. 'Uber-for-the-sea' is still a terrible idea.
Next time let's buy the full size SUV
We've got a whale on our tail
Then perhaps you should douche more often.
It isn't easy being locovores.
If you think I was tailgating - check this guy out.
Don't you think this is a bit much, just to prove the caviar was locally sourced?
Fish AGAIN tonight. I wanted to get Chinese takeout.
Smells fishy to me!
Looks fishy to me.
Not getting the sedan might be the stupidest thing I've ever done.
My fortune cookie said, "You will have a whale of a trip."
Let's stop off and get some krill.
Maybe if we bought a large freezer...
I suppose you don't dig fins on a mini.
I should've listened to you about not fording that stream.
I had in mind a smaller memento from our summer vacation.
It was on sale at SeaWorld.
Back in the '80s we used to have those every Friday.
I told you we should have gotten the full-sized SUV!!!
Backseat diver.
I thought you liked to whale on my driving!
It's hard to believe this Hybrid is really reducing our carbon footprint.
I don't get what this "problem" is you're talking about.
We should have bought a Hummer.
Well, since you got blubber instead of flubber, at least put a red flag on the tail!
I think we had to make the left before the aquarium.
next time we dine at an all you can eat buffet,don't ask for a doggy bag
You're the one who said 'try some krill'.
I think it said you can run your car on blubber, not the whole whale.
Were you playing "Hitch Hiker's Guide" again?
Once again she makes us take her beach party leftovers.
It's my alternative to talk radio...
It's sad that someone hit it--let's hope it was a stray.
When I offered to be the designated driver, this isn't what I had in mind.
Stop blubbering. We'll have a whale of a time
Perhaps a humpback whale was the wrong choice.
How was I supposed to know he'd be scared of the the fishing boats!
I'm thinking steak for dinner...
It's a backwards take on the the book of Jonah.
Don't test me, Moby. One more word out of you and I will turn this car around and go right back to Sea World.
You're right. I've got to do something. I'll buy a convertible next week.
Officially, an Uber trainee.
If you get all up in his krill he becomes a bit of a backseat diver.
Right, I have told the company that this new carpool feature was somewhat misleading.
Not a fish; Is So; Is Not; Is So; Is............
You know we've got a whale on our tail, don't you...and really, you're NOT allowed to say that's a whale of a tale!
Will it fit in the refrigerator?
I can't believe this legroom!
Now that we've managed to discuss the elephant in the room...
Anybody in the mood for seafood?
I've had it with your back seat driving.
What we need is a humpback car
….but honey, we are HOV3; Jonah is riding in the fish.
Still, it was rude of them to decline our dinner gift
Is anybody gonna address the whale in the car?
Does it look like my brake lights are out?
The whale fishing was ok, it's the lobster watching that I found a bit boring.
You're bored?" "I had a whale of a time!"
I just happy that it stopped fishtailing.
M'am, I work for Unter
Whale of a time
I mean it. I've run out of gastropod.
What's the matter . . . feeling sea sick?
Uber needs a revision.
I thought I signed an agreement to deliver the WHOLE shipment.
I wanted our hump back for the ride.
Don’t worry, no one knows there’s a baby whale in the trunk.
We're going to need a bigger coupe.
So exactly how far behind are we on our premiums to the Neptune Society?
F-L-U-K-E
I'm stuffed; Maybe we shouldn't have ordered all-you-can-eat sushi take-out?
The top speed is not great but it has a lot of torque.
It's smarter than sandbags.
What the Aquarium don't know won't hurt it.
Let the cat try his goldfish trick this guy.
I told you we should have kept that rendering pot
What did you think would happen when you send in that Adopt-A-Whale card?
OK, you're right. We shouldn't have named the boat "Jonah."
You're the one who called for an Uber Pool
If he sings that damned eeee-ooo-eee-uhhh song one more time, we're dropping him at the bus station.
He could be dangerous. What if he squashed some guy on an island? We'd never know!
It's been a whale of a vacation!
We fail to have a tale to explain the whale.
Well, I did promise you a whale of a time, didn't I?
You said you wanted fish for supper!
I suppose we aught to invest in a bigger fish tank
I knew this would happen, but you insisted on the sedan!
Boy, that's one big 18 wheeler on our tail.
I think that our after-market rear view mirror might be acting up.
Yea, Roger, that's how the term "fish tail" originated.
I'll take the car in tomorrow to get customized seat belts, and I'll pick up a red flag for his tail.
When are we going to talk about the elephant in the room that's under the whale?
I told you not to call me Ishmael.
Herman missed the school bus.
Why can't I say it was a joint effort? After all I did buy the bait.
The 'sharing economy' is becoming a fishy business.
Well, I had a whale of a time.
i heard it was a wishing whale
Since neither one of us is willing to broach the elephant in the room, I thought this might work.
Darn, another whale-gater!
I am exhausted! What a vacation and to think I have to wait another year to have this much fun again. Life is wonderful.
So, we can get a freezer!
Honey, I promise I keep him in our pool for just a few weeks.
I sick and tired of you feeling like a third whale.
Damn whalegater.
In the future, please don't pack for both of us.
I don't think this is a car wash
maybe we should have left it in the water.
It's going to cost a fortune to stuff that thing.
I know I know. We need to go south.
Sing along if you wish, dear. I'll split the plankton.
But I have always wanted a white elephant.
I think he escaped from Sea World.
Sorry, I mentioned fish in my dating profile.
There ought to be a law against whalegating.
First time in a Mercedes-Baleen?
I know it's a bit extreme, but what's the other option? Stale caviar?
But, honey, you said I keep whatever I caught!
I told you I didn't want to go to the beach!
You had to bring a third wheel!
This isn't what I meant by having a whale of a time at the shore.
I thought it said SALE!
Brian found out the hard way that Ambien and fish tacos should not be taken in the same evening.
Don't look now but I think we are being followed.
I'm thinkin' of baleen out of this krilling traffic.
How could it smell fishy?
Hey, at least we don't have to fool with a car seat.
Move over Ahabass!
Are you sure your aquarium is big enough?
Hey Benjamin, that animal was used in an earlier Caption Contest! Tsk, tsk!
How was I supposed to know you didn't want fish for dinner>
Did you remember to post it on all our social media?
I know you told me driving for Uber was a bad idea, but you don't have to be so smug about it!
You're the one who wanted to vacation in Nantucket.
Look, if we drive all over town looking for krill for a recipe, you're got to expect this sort of thing.
I'm all for green energy. But the whale powered technology just isn't there yet.
I thought if SeaWorld could do it, why not me?
Damnit, I'm never doing UberPOOL again.
My fault? This wasn't a marine sanctuary last week.
I'm glad we met that old man by the seashore selling the catch of the day.
I'm a little concerned about my tire pressure. Would you mind walking?
Catch Of The Day
Talk about a tale that’s actually the tail of a whale.
I told you, Sea World is back!"
"This is really a whale of a whale story".
What? You said a refuge?
Ever have the feeling you're driving around in Steven Spielberg's nightmare?
I'm tired of the beach - how about the mountains?
Oh yeah? Well, your mama's so fat....
And I thought we left tailgaters behind in the city.
Ok, so I hit the curb when I back into the space sometimes. But did you hear a kind of a gutteral moan?
I don't care if you do think it may be an overweight mermaid; it's still fat-shaming!
Whale; what did you expect?
I don't know if I'd go back to the whole sale sushi place….
If you were in such a hurry, we should have taken the Stingray!
A whale of a time, you say?
So you cheaped out on the navigation device and got a fish finder instead? Seriously?
There's no need to call me 'Ahab' just because I love fishing.
What, the Uber location should have been a tip-off for me? You've got to be kidding!
You sure you don't need a tag, Ishmael.
Four years at college, and this is the best you could do?
I told you that I was fishing!
How did the whale from the Cartoon Caption Contest of August 8th & 15th get into the back seat of our car?
His story about Jonah is a driveway moment.
He insisted on going to Captain Ahab's retirement party.
He has a 5-star app rating.
But believe it or not, goldfish are now endangered.
Did the dealership say anything about off-shore seating?
Not the "humpback" I was looking.
You didn't have to pick UberPool.
The girls will have to take the bus home.
Had a whale of a time during my presentation today....
If we want to continue with your new hobby, we will need to buy a car with a rear facing camera.
I don't I'm going to continue driving for uberPOOL.
It sure beats a tee shirt from "Black Dog."
You'll change your tune when you see it mounted on our living room wall.
Whatcha gonna do with all that blubber inside yo trunk?
You didn't say a whale was the deal.
I told you I'd planned a whale of a good time. How could anyone possibly have been clearer?
Hey, there are plenty more fish in the sea.
Still kvetching about non-vegan and non-Kosher?
We're only doing sixty clicks...oh...sorry...that's the whale.
Looks like we are being whale tailed.
Think we have enough krill for the weekend?
I could have sworn you said "bring some filets home for dinner."
I told you we shouldn't have gotten the sub-compact.
Every time we visit your parents, I feel like a fish out of water!
I love a yard sale as much as you and no you can't put them in the pool tonight!
We like to road trip from Alaska to Hawaii every winter.
He needs to hide. People are watching him.
Nothing exciting ever happens to us. It's just the same old, same old.
You should have driven the one that got away.
Next year, no trading in the goldfish prizes at the carnival
I know. I know. Appearing in all these New Yorker Cartoons IS giving him a big head.
I'm really pulling some tail.
My rearview mirrors show odd images
Last time you said the fish I caught 'wasn't even big enough to see!'
Oh yeah? Well who said she wanted to have a whale of a time?
Go ahead, say it.
Don't look back, hon, we are moving onward!
I'm not paranoid, someone is on our tail.
I know your father flushed your goldfish down the toilet when you were four but is this your opportune moment?
Like I said, koi ponds are so 20th century.
Well I don't know about you, but I had a whale of a time.
Maybe we should have stopped after the baby buffalo.
The advert said a mammoth trunk; I don't think so.
Everyone hitchhikes around here.
So...I guess this means we should buy Tommy a drumset for Christmas this year? I told him we would if it didn't take up so much space.
I think we have a flat tire
I meant whale.
Isn't it about time we splurge and rent the SUV?
You know, Jonah, that's hard to swallow.
'Blackfish'? I've never heard of it.
Let's discuss the elephant in the living room.
Seat belt? Are you nuts?
It's better than getting another goldfish
I'd say we had a whale of day.
