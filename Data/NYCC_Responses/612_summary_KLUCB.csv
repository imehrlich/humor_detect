5404,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,I'll say they've been here a long time.
5584,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,There's something missing here.
5595,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,I don't like the way this case is progressing.
6863,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,"It's an interesting theory, but some people may not want to believe it."
5646,3137,3,15,52,70,1.3,0.06546536707079771,612,Here's my theory...
5687,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,I suspect Darwin.
6919,3137,3,15,52,70,1.3,0.06546536707079771,612,"You’re right sergeant, the perp’s pattern is definitely evolving........"
7229,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,My theory of whodunnit is still evolving.
7025,3137,3,15,52,70,1.3,0.06546536707079771,612,I have a theory about what happened.
8298,3137,3,15,52,70,1.3,0.06546536707079771,612,"Time of death estimates vary, but first responders say sometime after the Early Devonian Period"
8310,3137,3,15,52,70,1.3,0.06546536707079771,612,You're out there somewhere Natural Selection...and I'm going to find you.
8371,3137,3,15,52,70,1.3,0.06546536707079771,612,"Our theory of the case is evolving, Chief."
8459,3137,2,17,51,70,1.3,0.06222246869713582,612,Creationists? No proof. Looks like the work of the Darwin gang to me.
8515,3137,6,9,55,70,1.3,0.0743501870243714,612,The suspect had been quietly at large for 5 million years.
8787,3137,1,19,50,70,1.3,0.05880099434378475,612,Let's see where the DNA points us
8894,3137,3,15,52,70,1.3,0.06546536707079771,612,They had a lineup at headquarters and the witness made a natural selection.
8895,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,Fishy? Originally. But now the facts on the ground are evolving.
9026,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,God. I think I know who did it.
9036,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,"I like Scopes for this one, but I just don't think we can bring it to trial."
4552,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,I can't believe it evolved into this.
9104,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,"Notify the families, but don’t worry about the fish."
9254,3137,2,17,51,70,1.3,0.06222246869713582,612,Darwin again.
9288,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,This is definitely going to be a fast-evolving investigation.
9072,3137,6,9,55,70,1.3,0.0743501870243714,612,Would've been simpler just to take out Darwin.
8285,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,Just like the others but what's the missing link?
6983,3137,3,15,52,70,1.3,0.06546536707079771,612,My theory on this case is still evolving.
8256,3137,6,9,55,70,1.3,0.0743501870243714,612,"So then, it appears the situation evolved swiftly."
8211,3137,2,17,51,70,1.3,0.06222246869713582,612,Looks like the trilobite got away from the murderer. Find out if it saw anything.
7185,3137,2,17,51,70,1.3,0.06222246869713582,612,"Actually yes, I do have a theory."
7219,3137,3,15,52,70,1.3,0.06546536707079771,612,What we're witnessing is the evolution of a serial killer.
7243,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,The victim’s name was Darwin.....Charles Darwin.
7269,3137,5,11,54,70,1.3,0.07151133921002156,612,I don't believe the fish but the rest seems ok
7367,3137,5,11,54,70,1.3,0.07151133921002156,612,We have no clue who will be next.
7516,3137,6,9,55,70,1.3,0.0743501870243714,612,I think Darwin had this same problem.......
7553,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,I'd say that our suspect has a pretty long-standing grudge.
7767,3137,5,11,54,70,1.3,0.07151133921002156,612,We'd better turn this one over to Inspector Darwin.
7789,3137,3,15,52,70,1.3,0.06546536707079771,612,Did they know the ascendant?
7791,3137,2,17,51,70,1.3,0.06222246869713582,612,Well this case evolved quickly.
7899,3137,3,15,52,70,1.3,0.06546536707079771,612,It seems as if accidents have been happening here forever.
7974,3137,2,17,51,70,1.3,0.06222246869713582,612,I guess it's pretty clear how this crime evolved...
8060,3137,3,15,52,70,1.3,0.06546536707079771,612,Hmm... there must be a missing link between these victims
8081,3137,5,11,54,70,1.3,0.07151133921002156,612,"It all seems a bit sketchy, if you ask me."
8153,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,We need Detective Darwin; these clues keep evolving.
8241,3137,2,17,51,70,1.3,0.06222246869713582,612,We're working with an evolving crime scene.
4418,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,Looks like someone met an evolutionary dead end.
5692,3137,2,17,51,70,1.3,0.06222246869713582,612,I sense a missing link.
4348,3137,2,17,51,70,1.3,0.06222246869713582,612,The good news is the fittest survived!
4412,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,So then the mystery is what comes next
2203,3137,7,7,56,70,1.3,0.07708455737375189,612,Looks like that damn Darwin again.
2176,3137,6,9,55,70,1.3,0.0743501870243714,612,The case is evolving: our perp will be the fittest among them.
2095,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,They tried to make it look like natural selection.
1732,3137,3,15,52,70,1.3,0.06546536707079771,612,We call this Darwin’s hopscotch.
1561,3137,5,11,54,70,1.3,0.07151133921002156,612,I'll be damned if I can figure out the missing link here.
1494,3137,3,15,52,70,1.3,0.06546536707079771,612,"""His choice of victims seems to be evolving""."
1440,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,Looks like they've been mowed down by a time machine.
1426,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,Evolution of a dead man walking!
1393,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,"Despite what happened here, I still love a parade."
1382,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,Call HR. This has diversity written all over it.
1358,3137,3,15,52,70,1.3,0.06546536707079771,612,Let's just tell the press that the situation is still evolving...
1315,3137,6,9,55,70,1.3,0.0743501870243714,612,I don’t think these all occurred at the same time.
1254,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,"""Good heavens, they finally got all the family in one shot."
1252,3137,3,15,52,70,1.3,0.06546536707079771,612,We better call Detective Darwin on this one. And tell him to bring his beagle.
1104,3137,3,15,52,70,1.3,0.06546536707079771,612,How did you get evolved in this?
1057,3137,3,15,52,70,1.3,0.06546536707079771,612,Keep me updated as the situation evolves.
44,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,"Go back to the beginning and tell me again, what happened?"
115,3137,1,19,50,70,1.3,0.05880099434378475,612,"I assumed they just wanted to discredit the theory, not actually kill evolution."
217,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,Make me a list of every Creationist in town.
372,3137,5,11,54,70,1.3,0.07151133921002156,612,He died a very slow death.
494,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,Let’s just say that my thinking on the case has evolved.
537,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,"This case is definitely evolving, but that's just a theory."
2306,3137,6,9,55,70,1.3,0.0743501870243714,612,My view on this case is evolving.
571,3137,6,9,55,70,1.3,0.0743501870243714,612,"I don’t know what’s more upsetting, losing my family like this, or Ted’s depiction of my kids."
733,3137,0,21,49,70,1.3,0.05516772843673705,612,Contact detective Darwin. He's good at these cases.
740,3137,2,17,51,70,1.3,0.06222246869713582,612,Guess you could call this natural selection.
819,3137,2,17,51,70,1.3,0.06222246869713582,612,Get Sergeant Darwin down here immediately.
903,3137,5,11,54,70,1.3,0.07151133921002156,612,"Hmmm, evolution AND extinction. Tough one."
909,3137,1,19,50,70,1.3,0.05880099434378475,612,It started as a poaching case but clearly evolved into murder.
1012,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,Looks like someone's trying to frame Darwin again.
723,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,This looks like an evolving case.
2317,3137,3,15,52,70,1.3,0.06546536707079771,612,Creationists have gone too far this time!
791,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,My theory is still evolving.
2386,3137,5,11,54,70,1.3,0.07151133921002156,612,Looks like the boys in homoerecticide got it cut out for ‘em.
4322,3137,6,9,55,70,1.3,0.0743501870243714,612,Why don't we see how this case evolves?
4199,3137,5,11,54,70,1.3,0.07151133921002156,612,"Apparently, this case is still evolving."
4131,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,Finally! This is the missing link we need to crack this case wide open.
4049,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,Looks to me like the way this guy chooses his victims is evolving.
3967,3137,5,11,54,70,1.3,0.07151133921002156,612,I think we're dealing with a serial Biblical literalist.
3900,3137,2,17,51,70,1.3,0.06222246869713582,612,There is only one possible motive; extinction!
3826,3137,2,17,51,70,1.3,0.06222246869713582,612,"Obviously, there have been some developments on the case."
3816,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,I guess he hit an evolutionary dead-end.
3697,3137,3,15,52,70,1.3,0.06546536707079771,612,Ask inspector Darwin for his theory on this one.
3680,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,Clearly not a case of random selection.
3671,3137,5,11,54,70,1.3,0.07151133921002156,612,"God did it, case closed."
3566,3137,5,11,54,70,1.3,0.07151133921002156,612,"If this case evolves any more, it will be beyond me."
3505,3137,7,7,56,70,1.3,0.07708455737375189,612,Looks like God's not the only one who's dead anymore.
3485,3137,5,11,54,70,1.3,0.07151133921002156,612,I have a strange feeling this case is going to evolve slowly over a long period of time.
3476,3137,1,19,50,70,1.3,0.05880099434378475,612,We stilll can’t find that missing link to tie this whole case together!
3518,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,It looks like the victim was chosen by natural selection
3401,3137,2,17,51,70,1.3,0.06222246869713582,612,Seems like an organized crime.
2421,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,"We don’t have any suspects yet, but the case is still evolving."
2569,3137,5,11,54,70,1.3,0.07151133921002156,612,Call Detective Darwin.
2599,3137,2,17,51,70,1.3,0.06222246869713582,612,"What happened? Well, I've got a theory..."
2743,3137,5,11,54,70,1.3,0.07151133921002156,612,Assign this case to detective Darwin.
2771,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,I see the Creationists are at it again.
2873,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,"The evidence points to Darwin, but it's still just a theory."
2948,3137,5,11,54,70,1.3,0.07151133921002156,612,Have we run a check on that guy Darwin yet?
2848,3137,3,15,52,70,1.3,0.06546536707079771,612,"So, they weren't the fittest after all."
2974,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,It all seemed to end right here.
3003,3137,4,13,53,70,1.3,0.06855503599782095,612,The facts of his life and past are completely clear. Now we have to find the killer before he strikes AGAIN and Again and again and again and again.
3225,3137,7,7,56,70,1.3,0.07708455737375189,612,I suspect Creationism
3283,3137,2,17,51,70,1.3,0.06222246869713582,612,Looks like another Missing Link case. Get me Charles Darwin!
3356,3137,3,15,52,70,1.3,0.06546536707079771,612,"This is a first. The evolution of a crime, perfectly preserved."
2972,3137,3,15,52,70,1.3,0.06546536707079771,612,This one's gonna take quite a while.
2376,3137,3,15,52,70,1.3,0.06546536707079771,612,Fake news.

6655,3612,1,16,47,64,1.28125,0.060866551595885596,612,We can rule out anyone who is a Darwinist.
6560,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,My thinking on this case is evolving.
6532,3612,1,16,47,64,1.28125,0.060866551595885596,612,This appears to be an evolving case!
6476,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,This looks like a case for Inspector Darwin
6473,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,They are calling him DASK. The Darwin Awards Serial Killer. Ultra-literal creationist.
6364,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,I told him his past would catch up to him one day.
6174,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,Our investigation is evolving before our eyes
6340,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,Put out an ABP for the VP.
6228,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,This guy's m.o. seems to be evolving.
6668,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,Where do we draw the line on manslaughter?
6072,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,"Ah, but do we read left to right? Or right to left?"
6010,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,Looks like the Darwin Killer struck again.
5998,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,We'll see how this case evolves but my money is on Adam and Eve.
6342,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,Looks awful fishy to me.
6680,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,It's fascinating to watch a case evolve.
6731,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,These crimes keep getting more sophisticated.
6721,3612,0,18,46,64,1.28125,0.05664543544843536,612,Looks like our killer is a creationist
7156,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,Talk about your rapidly evolving case.
7127,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,But will they still be able to climb trees?
7031,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,Don’t rush it.....let’s see how this case evolves.
7012,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,I have a theory on this one.
6993,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,The evolving sophistication of these killings lead me to believe the next victim will surely be a woman.
6978,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,Well we’re going to have to go way back in the cold case files for this one.
6962,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,"It started as a cold case, but it's evolved."
6909,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,I get the feeling that we might be next.
6845,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,Better put in a call to Darwin on this one.
6844,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,Ziss looks very suspecies.
6818,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,Looks like the killer is evolving.
6751,3612,1,16,47,64,1.28125,0.060866551595885596,612,I never thought evolution could lead to this.
6746,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,Prime suspects gotta be the Darwins--looks just like their minivan back window.
6733,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,I think it's some kind of intelligent design.
5989,3612,5,8,51,64,1.28125,0.07542455891353682,612,The killer’s victims are evolving slowly over time.
6697,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,"I see the connection between the first four outlines, but there seems to be a missing link between the last two."
5964,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,Looks like this is an evolving case.
5874,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,Any witnesses?
5881,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,The graffiti has been rapidly evolving.
5159,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,"Yes, it was a pretty big bang. But who did it?"
5101,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,Are we still doing Darwin Awards?
5084,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,It looks like the work of the Darwin Killer.
4742,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,Our killer seems to be evolving.
5020,3612,1,16,47,64,1.28125,0.060866551595885596,612,"Observe Astley! Scientific! The perp was steadfastly specific, vastly petroglyphic, ghastly horrific and lastly prolific."
4985,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,"You see, even criminology recapitulates phylogeny."
5233,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,Interesting how the clues in this case are evolving.
4950,3612,5,8,51,64,1.28125,0.07542455891353682,612,The solution to this case will be evolutionary.
4892,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,The killer is evolving.
4861,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,"Unfortunately, it reads left to right."
4760,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,I can see this crime evolving.
7164,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,"I have a theory about who did it, but that too is evolving."
4829,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,My theory is evolving on this one.
4838,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,Looks like a mass extinction.
4921,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,Wouldn't it be ironic if their vehicle had these as the family decals?
5912,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,Wait. How did this happen? It was on the back window of his SUV.
5250,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,I admit it may be difficult to conceive but here's my theory.....
5451,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,Looks like the homicidal creationist has struck again.
5825,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,"Telltale signs of a serial killer, probably up to no good since the Precambrian eon I am guessing."
5814,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,"Well, you can bet no Republicans will believe this."
5811,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,His M.O. has really been evolving.
5795,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,Now if we could only figure out a connection between the victims...
5773,3612,0,18,46,64,1.28125,0.05664543544843536,612,This case is evolving into something really weird.
5772,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,The charges are evolving to manslaughter.
5290,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,Round up all the creationists.
5743,3612,0,18,46,64,1.28125,0.05664543544843536,612,"Huh, some cases really do evolve."
5691,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,The poor saps. Looks like the work of Alabama judges.
5688,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,"It started out as a slime scene, but evolved from there."
5662,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,It's obvious intelligent design is not the culprit.
5624,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,"So, it's just a theory until I find the missing link."
5579,3612,1,16,47,64,1.28125,0.060866551595885596,612,This is why I avoid GMOs.
5577,3612,1,16,47,64,1.28125,0.060866551595885596,612,Our knowledge of the crime is still evolving.
5739,3612,1,16,47,64,1.28125,0.060866551595885596,612,huh... talk about character evolution.
7191,3612,5,8,51,64,1.28125,0.07542455891353682,612,It’s an evolutionary case.
8123,3612,1,16,47,64,1.28125,0.060866551595885596,612,This accident has a history.
7248,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,I think that last one was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
8747,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,"Just shows, if you don't crack down on crime, it evolves."
8710,3612,1,16,47,64,1.28125,0.060866551595885596,612,What I see here is an evolving crime scene.
8695,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,I can you right now this will literally take millions of years to solve!
8643,3612,1,16,47,64,1.28125,0.060866551595885596,612,God only knows what that's supposed to mean.
8628,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,I understand there are no next of kin.
8620,3612,1,16,47,64,1.28125,0.060866551595885596,612,"At first I thought it was fishy, but my thoughts on the case are evolving."
8810,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,This looks like an evolving case.
8579,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,It appears to have taken some time
8541,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,"Where do we go with this? One witness says he was wearing a sharkskin suit, another says it was an Armani."
8393,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,"OK, we’ve got an evolving crime scene here"
8390,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,"Here's what I think, although it's only a theory..."
8347,3612,5,8,51,64,1.28125,0.07542455891353682,612,"Clearly, he wasn't the fittest."
8336,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,We are looking for a very patient killer.
8328,3612,1,16,47,64,1.28125,0.060866551595885596,612,Put out an APB for Charles Darwin.
8577,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,"Mark my words, we have all the makings of a cold case."
8218,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,"For a case like this, we're going to have to develop a theory."
8834,3612,5,8,51,64,1.28125,0.07542455891353682,612,"It's evolutionary, my dear Watson & Crick."
8978,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,"That’s Darwin with a “D”, right?"
9295,3612,5,8,51,64,1.28125,0.07542455891353682,612,This is a rapidly evolving case.
9249,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,I have a hunch this is the work of a serial Creationist.
9241,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,No bodies were found. My theory on the graffiti's origin is an artist wants pedestrians to struggle to write captions and then crowds will naturally select the best one.
9228,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,This is evolving into an interesting case.
9205,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,It really is survival of the fittest out here
9182,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,We’ve got some leads on a man called Darwin...
8917,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,What kind of animal would do such a thing?
9120,3612,6,6,52,64,1.28125,0.07864410870073697,612,This kind of case has been a long time coming.
9042,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,"Put it on the non-urgent list. The killer will take at least 100,000 years to commit another crime."
9028,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,Looks like we have five Darwin Award nominees

8990,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,"It appears to be evolutionary, my dear Watson."

9047,3612,5,8,51,64,1.28125,0.07542455891353682,612,Open and shut case. God wins.
8191,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,Here we see the evolution of the crime.
8161,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,Wait a minute. I’ve seen this man before!
8138,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,"Find out if the suspect has an alibi for 4,000,000,000 years ago."
7760,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,What degenerate could have done such a thing?
7663,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,I estimate the time of death to be 350 million years ago.
7532,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,"I’d say this was an act of God, but..."
7499,3612,5,8,51,64,1.28125,0.07542455891353682,612,"Stop taking notes about the case, I want your opinion on this drawing my son did."
7419,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,... I just knew it was a little fishy.
7400,3612,5,8,51,64,1.28125,0.07542455891353682,612,Forensics is sure it wasn't planned.
7779,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,In which direction are we supposed to view this exhibit?
7394,3612,5,8,51,64,1.28125,0.07542455891353682,612,"Unfortunately, there were no witnesses."
7371,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,Their only surviving relative is an ameoba.
7358,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,I like the creationists for this.
7357,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,"This is a fishy case, but it's evolving."
7316,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,Looks like this case has evolved quickly.
7282,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,What we have here is an evolving crime scene.
7262,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,"I gotta say, part of me doesn't want to catch the perp. I'm curious to see what comes next."
7388,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,This case is evolving quite rapidly
7820,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,It appears to be the result of a long-time family feud.
7823,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,Now to find the missing link.
7837,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,Let's get the line-up ready and see who the witnesses naturally select.
8126,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,"Well, we can eliminate the Creationist suspects."
4735,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,And life imitates art.
8118,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,The motive? It's a long story.
8066,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,"""Seems it just evolved out of nothing, and escalated from there, with total randomness......"
8051,3612,5,8,51,64,1.28125,0.07542455891353682,612,That was quite a past to flash before his eyes.
8044,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,Looks like we should call Detective Darwin in on this one.
8026,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,"Even with the evidence, it’s still just a theory."
8024,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,This is definitely a serial killer!
7998,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,Looks like we've got a serial killer.
7962,3612,6,6,52,64,1.28125,0.07864410870073697,612,Better call 'em potholes or we'll be here all night.
7935,3612,5,8,51,64,1.28125,0.07542455891353682,612,Looks like the Catholic Church was here
7932,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,My thoughts on cause of death are evolving
7925,3612,5,8,51,64,1.28125,0.07542455891353682,612,All evidence points to Darwin.
7908,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,"Mr. Darwin, Please describe what you believe to have evolved here."
7877,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,We have good chances to solve this 243 million years old cold case.
7218,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,It'll take a million years to solve this case.
4679,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,"I have a theory about this case, but it’s just a theory."
6229,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,Better call the zoo
4573,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,"This is just a theory, but it looks like the work of an intelligent designer."
1157,3612,1,16,47,64,1.28125,0.060866551595885596,612,"What's your theory, officer?"
1173,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,"So that's what they mean by ""an evolving crime scene"""
1192,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,The slowest murder ever .
1205,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,We're wasting out time; I think the statute of limitations has passed.
1270,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,The perp is armed and dangerous. He’s carrying an evolver.
1277,3612,1,16,47,64,1.28125,0.060866551595885596,612,"I must conclude that, over an unknown period of time, something fishy happened to an upstanding citizen."
1303,3612,1,16,47,64,1.28125,0.060866551595885596,612,"Look, there's the missing link..."
1304,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,Our investigation is still evolving.
1346,3612,5,8,51,64,1.28125,0.07542455891353682,612,Say nothing to the press. The case is still evolving.
1363,3612,5,8,51,64,1.28125,0.07542455891353682,612,The profilers tell me our killer is evolving.
1374,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,That must have been a long light
1449,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,"Well we know one thing, whoever did it was diabolically thorough."
1454,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,It seems the case is evolving.
1532,3612,1,16,47,64,1.28125,0.060866551595885596,612,Our view of the case is evolving.
1579,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,It looks like we'll need him on this case. I agree. I'll call the station and get Detective Darwin. Get him quickly before this case evolves.

1659,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,I'm not happy with the way this case is evolving.
2123,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,Evolved right up to the revolver.
2111,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,Hard To Believe
2094,3612,1,16,47,64,1.28125,0.060866551595885596,612,Could be a creationist trying to throw us off the scent.
2048,3612,1,16,47,64,1.28125,0.060866551595885596,612,What scares me is the one who got away!
2046,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,"Detective: Whilst all the police attention, I would hardly claim this to be a rapidly evolving crime scene."
1959,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,Could you please describe this Mr. Darwin for me so we can put out an APB on him.
1142,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,I picked the wrong week to become a creationist.
1936,3612,0,18,46,64,1.28125,0.05664543544843536,612,Apparently the scene is still evolving.
1920,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,It's a very old cold case.
1910,3612,1,16,47,64,1.28125,0.060866551595885596,612,"It’s not a closed case, but my theory that is evolving."
1860,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,It looks like this case is evolving.
1811,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,Shouldn't it be left to right?
1797,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,How long did the CSI team leave this body out?
1764,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,Looks like this has been an evolving problem for some time.
1931,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,The story here is still evolving.
1078,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,We're looking for an apex predator.
1076,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,Looks like it starts out kinda fishy but this could evolve into one of our biggest cases yet.
1061,3612,1,16,47,64,1.28125,0.060866551595885596,612,The press? Just tell them it's an evolving investigation.
259,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,The evolution of the crime is clear in this case.
216,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,Looks like we’re deaing with a serial evolutionist.
202,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,"I realize all the evidence points in one direction, but it's still just a theory."
190,3612,5,8,51,64,1.28125,0.07542455891353682,612,I knew it would come to this.
181,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,I see our killer is evolving.
155,3612,1,16,47,64,1.28125,0.060866551595885596,612,There have been no reports of missing links so we are having trouble contacting next-of-kin on most of them.
294,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,This case is slowly evolving.
130,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,I’m guessing ... an extremely old serial killer.
93,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,Looks like the 'Son of Darwin' has struck again.
79,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,We'll find more leads as the case evolves further.
77,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,This case is evolving rapidly.
40,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,The evidence was evolutionary.
1,3612,0,18,46,64,1.28125,0.05664543544843536,612,Flying rat? I'll show'em a flying rat.
4605,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,We believe the murder weapon was a 38 caliber Smith and Wesson evolver.
112,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,Great! Now the Creationists are going to be all over us for improper profiling.
2147,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,My analysis of this case continues to evolve.
402,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,Takes a certain type of person to shoot down Darwin's theory.
456,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,Looks like another hit and run by Banksy.
1049,3612,5,8,51,64,1.28125,0.07542455891353682,612,"I do not think this will convince the creationists, Sharon."
1032,3612,0,18,46,64,1.28125,0.05664543544843536,612,This must have taken millions of years. How did no one notice?
961,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,"Needless to say, the case is still evolving."
889,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,This case is constantly evolving
842,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,This case really IS cold.
840,3612,1,16,47,64,1.28125,0.060866551595885596,612,Busy corner.
407,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,It's the evolution of a serial killer.
749,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,Evidence of the evolving criminal mind.
652,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,I’ve got a theory
650,3612,1,16,47,64,1.28125,0.060866551595885596,612,The profiler says his M.O. is evolving.
570,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,What comes after the human?
550,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,This case is definitely evolving.
545,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,"I have a theory, Sergeant."
477,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,"Well, that's one theory."
679,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,Looking for who was evolved in the crime.
2158,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,Now that's something you don't see every day.
1510,3612,4,10,50,64,1.28125,0.07206130960001934,612,I've got a theory about this.
2243,3612,2,14,48,64,1.28125,0.06481333851304336,612,It maybe just a theory buts it’s compelling
4142,3612,3,12,49,64,1.28125,0.06853320797422294,612,We'll need detective Scopes for this one.
4089,3612,1,16,47,64,1.28125,0.060866551595885596,612,That’s the fourth one this week! Looks like “the creationist” is back at it again

5211,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,I guess the Creationists won. The theory of evolution is dead.

8884,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,"Officer Jones, it appears this crime is still evolving!"
8882,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,Round up the usual suspects and get their alibis during the Jurassic age.
8870,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,What an animal.
8856,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,"Just note that local PD should probably beef up their presence here in about 100,000 years."
8841,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,"To tell you the truth, my theory on the motive is evolving."
8803,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,I don't have a clue about where we are going from here.
8801,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,"What we have here is, Darwin drawin' darlin'."
8791,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,T M I
8772,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,"Yes, officer, the case is evolving moment by moment."
8752,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,apparently they wouldn't stop following him.
8719,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,"Well I can tell you one thing, they weren’t created here."
8929,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,It's a serial killer all right...and he's evolving.
8704,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,This looks like a case for Detective Sherlock Darwin.
8622,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,He would have been better off deleting his Facebook account.
8605,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,We will see who’s the next jumper.
8603,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,This might evolve into something. Let's get sergeant Darwin on the case.
8582,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,We've got to do something about recidivism.
8565,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,"""Call the CSI, there's something fishy going on here!"
8560,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,"Call Mr Eden from ""Holy Mary High School"". He might have a suspicion."
8548,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,The crime scene is still developing.
8543,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,In all my years as a detective—I would have never suspected it...Not giving a mouse a cookie could turn out this way!
8536,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,"Unfortunately, I think we've hit a dead end."
8520,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,Looks like it started small and evolved from there.
8492,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,"Also, where is his tail?"
8679,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,"If the past is prolog, what's next?"
8947,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,Yet somehow I believe that these were all just random acts over a period of time. Probably none of them saw it coming.
8962,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,Who would do an awful thing like this? Go arrest the new people at EPA.
8966,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,It's clear the crime evolved slowly. The Deists aren't going to like this one bit!
8973,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,"When you told me you wanted to discuss the ""evolution of a criminal"", this is not what I pictured."
8994,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,I think those science deniers have been at it again.
9005,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,This looks like the making of a very cold case.
9009,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,The killer's taste is evolving.
9033,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,It looks like the work of the Animal Cracker Killer.
9049,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,Poor guy! fella by the name of Darwin
9090,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,I'd say this proves the theory of evolution beyond a shadow of a doubt.
9138,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,It appears that this investigation has been evolving from the Cambrian Period to the Cenozoic Era.
9163,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,I assume Chuck Darwin was the forensics guy on this one?
9164,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,I woke up this morning wanting to solve five murders in five stages of evolution.
9177,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,"Evidently, the killer is multi-organismic."
9178,5988,3,3,39,45,1.2,0.08164965809277261,612,"Looks like the end of the line for us, suspect in the car is glowing."
9209,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,This is bizarre even for Roswell.
9273,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,"We should get back to the office soon, this situation continues to de-evolve quickly"
9293,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,"Looks like we need the DSI: Darwinian Scene Investigators."""
9309,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,I am pretty sure our man was able to crawl before he could walk
9324,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,What do you think the funeral will look like?? i
9366,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,"Man, he went through puberty fast."
9376,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,"If I had to prosecute every fish trying to impersonate an officer, I'd never have time to go after serious fish crime."
9379,5988,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,612,Just write the suspect seems to be evolving.
9382,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,"This has got to stop right here, right now."
9383,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,They were a nuclear family.
4550,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,I doubt that even Darwin himself would be able to crack this case .
9396,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,"Well, I'm no Sherlock Holmes but I'm sure we can rule out one victim being a politician"
9398,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,The first was shot. The other four were D.O.A.
8491,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,The crime evolved quickly...
8490,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,Looks like Intelligent Design strikes again.
8438,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,"If I’m not mistaken, we’re witnessing the evolution of a crime."
8397,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,hmm Check if our suspect has an alibi for fifty-million years ago.
7596,5988,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,612,"Well, I guess evolution died off!"
7593,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,"""look for a guy named DARWIN""."
7578,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,"Well, I guess this kills our big bang theory."
7575,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,Your guess is as good as mine.
7565,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,Sad to think they were evolving nicely....
7548,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,Well at least they didn't go biblical on him
7536,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,This might be a strong biological evidence for the evolution of the case...
7525,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,The physical evidence is revolutionary.
7518,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,Strange...the victim seems to have walked right out of the crime scene!
7510,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,I told you gangs are evolving in this area.
7508,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,Looks like he had it coming.
7495,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,A serial killer with a Creationist message.
7437,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,"Lieutenant, when we catch the sicko who did this, I'm gonna throw The Book at 'em"
7432,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,"Write it up but no press, the creationists will freak out."
7424,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,I wish we would have gotten here sooner.
7421,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,"From all personal accounts, detective, he was not a truly “evolved man”."
7414,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,"This is what happened 20,000 years ago when you took your family out for walk in La Brea after dark."
7384,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,These sidewalk chalk artists are a real thorn in my side.
7335,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,It's the evolution of a crime scene.
7254,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,Chalk it up to a case of evolution.
7245,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,It appears the chalk artist is evolving.....
7240,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,"Let me guess, Marston, no leads have evolved yet, right?"
7234,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,His views on the crime bill had been evolving.
7202,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,Another one for cold cases.
7144,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,Be sure to send me updates as this case evolves.
7635,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,"After all that effort, what a waste."
7078,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,"By God, we're going to nab the astroid that did this!"
7681,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,My notes say 'courtesy of Keith Hering.'
7711,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,It's a process of elimination. Let's pull in the the amoeba for questioning.
8366,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,Walk me through your theory on how this crime evolved.
8363,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,I think we should get out of the way.
8322,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,It's an interesting theory. But what was the motive?
8291,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,"lady cop writes: of course, only men again"
8288,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,Just as we feared.... a killer targeting animorphs
8280,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,Did we ever pull in a mob head named Darwin?
8242,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,"When news of this gets out, the public is going to think that evolution is linear. That's the real crime here."
8163,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,I told the commissioner that this case will evolve slowly.
8155,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,I'm pretty sure I can figure out how this crime evolved.
8150,5988,0,10,40,50,1.2,0.05714285714285714,612,It's really too bad. I'd've fancied a dorsal fin.
8129,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,I sense Keith Haring’s clues are evolving.
8070,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,Send out an APB on Charles Darwin.
8058,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,This crime scene is rapidly evolving.
8050,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,The solution to the crime may be emerging.
8042,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,"I've seen this before. The last time investigation took 3,7 billion years."
8013,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,I don't get it. Who killed off who?
7999,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,"Okay, is this a crime scene or a Banksy ?"
7954,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,Looks like the work of a serial evolver.
7848,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,"'Looks like a case for inspector Darwin."""
7835,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,Looks like another Creationist Mob hit--rubbing out witnesses.
7827,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,The evolutionist strikes again.
7808,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,I can't be sure...but I've got a hunch the origins debate is about to get a whole lot more fiery.
7776,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,Put out an APB. This looks suspiciously like the work of the Appocolypse Killer.
7754,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,"I suspect this case involves a new, rapid-fire process for genetic modification."
7738,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,looks like it all ended right here.
7684,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,The killer is obviously a clever and devious Creationist who's trying to trick us into thinking a scientist did it.
4480,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,Clear evidence of the evolution of crime.
9080,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,Instincts tell me we're looking for a guy named Darwin.
4440,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,I fear the Darwin Mob is getting more sophisticated.
1594,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,..followed in his ancestors footsteps...
1562,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,A master of disguise!
1526,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,This crime clearly has some cold case elements.
1523,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,Foretelling isn't it?
1496,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,"Well, one thing you can say, this one goes back a long way."
1470,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,His pattern is evolving.
1464,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,We should question the Televangelists
1425,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,We're pretty sure the fish thing with legs has a motive - felt the rest were pushing him out.
1377,5988,3,3,39,45,1.2,0.08164965809277261,612,the only thing I can be sure of is that this crime was not intelligently designed...
1367,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,Our theory of this death is evolving.
1365,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,"It's Elementary Evolution, my dear Dr. Watson"
1337,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,We have to stop hiring dead body outliners from M.I.T.
1313,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,Things must have been moving fast.
1267,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,You have the right to remain confused.
1239,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,Call the mayor. This case has evolved into a nightmare.
1233,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,I'm thinking...Darwin!
1227,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,"It wasn't a hate crime, it was an art class about contours."
1178,5988,0,10,40,50,1.2,0.05714285714285714,612,How about we call Monk on this one?
1176,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,Yeah.... unless he was walking backwards.
1151,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,This case is fishy and growing some legs.
1150,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,Natural selection on overtime today.
1664,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,It would appear that this crime began millions of years ago.
1667,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,"I've seen this before, once in the late '80s. Evolution of serial killer."
1683,5988,3,3,39,45,1.2,0.08164965809277261,612,And I say good riddance to the Darwin Gang--what a bunch of lowlifes.
1706,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,"Yes, Captain. I agree. Murder has evolved."
2173,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,"It's just graffiti, but not an intelligent design."
2140,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,Our prime suspect is Darwin.
2128,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,"As a former medical technologist, it's the amoeba's murder than upsets me the most."
2092,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,And they all fell from the same branch?
2075,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,Death of a tail...Man!
2059,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,I see how why case is evolving so rapidly.
2040,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,This case could take a few million years.
2000,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,"And you said, ""Banksy sold out."""
1953,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,Looks like the serial killer has struck again.
1925,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,"I thought that when we moved to Texas, we’d get away from all this nonsense."
1131,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,It was a slow painful death.
1905,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,Survival of the bipedalest?
1878,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,Looks to me like he was either a Pisces or an Aquarius.
1861,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,"We've gathered loads of evidence in this case, but not everyone's going to believe my theory."
1847,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,We can eliminate Fundamentalists.
1846,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,"I don’t like how this investigation’s evolving, Callahan."
1843,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,So this is where the Christian Right buried the Theory of Evolution...
1841,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,It’s just as I suspected. Darwin strikes again.
1833,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,I just don't believe this can happen.
1766,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,And it all happened right here.
1749,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,And to think the first responders claimed there was no biological evidence...
1744,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,I know what you’re thinking...next he’s gonna kill the Internet.
1895,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,Interesting development.
1129,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,My opinion about the case is evolving.
1113,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,It's times like this that make me long for Clarence Darrow.
1062,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,I would say the case is evolving as predicted.
424,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,I don’t like how this case is evolving
417,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,I think Banksy's crossed the line here.
403,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,I think our crime problem is evolving.
398,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,"Well, well, well, this case evolved quickly."
383,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,"They told us to investigate the background on this, not the evolution."
334,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,"Well chief, it looks like the final nail in Darwin's coffin."
258,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,Next time it will be one of us.
253,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,"This nails it, ontogeny does recapitulate phylogeny"
231,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,It beats flying out of LaGuardia.
203,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,Clearly the work of a serial killer.
436,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,we seem to be missing a link here
160,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,Looks like Darwin was indeed correct.
92,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,Damn shame what they did to that ape!
87,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,Looks like Darwin strikes again...
73,5988,3,3,39,45,1.2,0.08164965809277261,612,My gut tells me creationism had a hand in this.
68,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,I guess all those species he pissed off finally caught up to him.
42,5988,3,3,39,45,1.2,0.08164965809277261,612,It looks like the work of the pet shop boys.
39,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,I fear this criminal is evolving.
25,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,Intelligent Design left not so smart fingerprints.
23,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,This case is rapidly evolving.
14,5988,3,3,39,45,1.2,0.08164965809277261,612,See? I told you science kills people.
4461,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,I'm thinking the killer must be between the age of Cambrian and Pleistocene.
124,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,Better get someone from the Missing Links Bureau over here.
2180,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,"I agree, Officer Darwin. This murder case is still evolving."
438,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,It seems our killer has evolved.
513,5988,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,612,Man. The story behind the crime...
1056,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,Darwin at work.
1038,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,It appears they were all victims of the same meteor crash.
997,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,"Oh, that's easy, Officer MacGuffin: It appears to be a simple case of devolution."
988,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,This investigation's evolving fast.
967,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,I have a hunch - which really makes me question my stage of evolution.
931,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,Find the missing link and we'll find our killer!
896,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,The first thing we need to do is find out if there is any relation between the victims.
886,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,This maniac's not going to stop until he catches 'em all.
865,5988,3,3,39,45,1.2,0.08164965809277261,612,"Well, this crime has definitely evolved into something bigger."
854,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,"Hmm, this case is evolving"
445,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,It looks like someone wanted Mr. Darwin and his theories out of the way.
831,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,I've been after this guy for billions of years.
807,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,Was the shark the only one wearing a seat belt?
797,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,Better notify the cold case division.
775,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,Let's look into the victim's history.
773,5988,3,3,39,45,1.2,0.08164965809277261,612,Ignorance killed evolution.
771,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,"Intelligent design, Officer, no pun intended."
763,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,We've put our cold case squad on it.
697,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,Put a warrant out for the 43rd Street Arthropods.
569,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,We haven't made any further progress up to this point.
554,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,Put out an APB for a guy named Darwin.
523,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,This case is really dragging on!
820,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,I’d say it was the evolution of manslaughter.
2291,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,I think I have seen them before- on the back window of a mini van...
492,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,"Mark it: DOA, Clarence Darrow and Associates."
4100,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,And you say they were all together in this tar pit?
4005,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,I don't believe in that murder
3963,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,It turn out that Darwin’s drawings was really a hit list...
3891,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,"At first I thought it was just a red herring, but my theory's evolving."
3867,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,"An eon to one shot, an eon to one."
3784,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,All signs point to a homocide.
3778,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,You don't see these figures on the family van.
3656,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,The facts in this case are evolving nicely.
3589,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,We will find the perpetrator on the next step of the ladder of evolution.
3556,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,This crime scene is the Pits
3535,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,It appears that this criminal’s M.O. is still evolving.
3534,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,Looks like an I think we can rule out natural selection.
3523,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,Looks like we found Darwin's stolen car decals
3507,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,We now know that evolution did not work in this case.
3475,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,"It doesn't matter how they evolved, they are all dead now."
3473,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,"As a statement, it's a bit on the nose, don't you think?"
3437,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,In the next stage they will have four wheels instead of arms and legs.
3432,5988,3,3,39,45,1.2,0.08164965809277261,612,Looks like another case for the Ancestral Violence Unit.
3420,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,Our prime suspect is a Creationist over in Coney Island.
3417,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,Damn kids drawing on the crime scene again.
3378,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,I'll go for number 2; she looks as if she can catch and carry!
3361,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,How many feet is that?
4008,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,It's clear the victim was NOT a climate change denier.
4028,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,Which way are they headed?
4039,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,The kids are at it again with the sidewalk chalk.
4047,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,This case is a tough one - it has been evolving for millions of years!
2318,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,"Put out an APB for a ""Charles Darwin"". Is the HMS Beagle still in dock?"
4410,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,"My dear Watson, it's evolutionary!"
4392,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,"Call Darwin, he’ll help."
4384,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,It is such an unnatural selection of victims.
4372,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,"I really need to cool it with the ""X-Files"""

3337,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,So was it all one person?
2482,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,It looks like where not the only ones trying to get away from the scene.
2479,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,Would you just take look at how much crime has evolved

2729,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,The killer took his time with this one!
3071,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,Better request help from our Galapagos Precinct.
3320,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,This is going to take years.

3221,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,We're going to have a problem with Creationist vigilantes.
3146,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,My best guess is that they all declined the killer's invitation to join his professional network on LinkedIn.
3142,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,That’s Scopes and friends.

2754,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,Another one by the Darwin serial killer......this is definately an evolving crime!
3053,5988,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,612,Well have to see how this case develops.
2390,5988,3,3,39,45,1.2,0.08164965809277261,612,Round up all the creationists who were in the area at the time.
3038,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,We've seen this pattern before
2832,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,Now we just need to figure out who the next victim will be.
2896,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,DNA evidence suggests they were all related.

3004,5988,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,612,Definitely the work of a serial killer that works slowly and methodically. Who knows when he'll strike next?
3029,5988,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,612,Looks like this case took a while to evolve

4003,7453,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,612,Definitely not a creationist.
3880,7453,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,612,This is what comes of mixing evolutionary stages.

2182,7453,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,612,Hmm. It looks like this one happened quite some time ago.

3450,7453,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,612,Try not to be too judgmental here! We should just let the facts evolve.
3340,7453,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,612,All signs point toward Darwin but I'm sure Creationists will propose another explanation.

2409,7453,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,612,It's too soon to jump to conclusions with this case still evolving.

8568,7453,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,612,"Either this killer’s been at this a LONG time, or he just went nuts at a pet store…"
8980,7453,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,612,The evidence just isn’t there.
1488,7453,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,612,That solves it!
8532,7453,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,612,I believe the reading of Darwin's works helps us in our investigation.
8501,7453,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,612,It's almost like an evolution.

8216,7453,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,612,This serial killer must be a humanist.
8096,7453,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,612,I doubt this is a recent happening Miss Watson.
8032,7453,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,612,"Hmm, I want to say the murderer doesn’t believe in evolution"
7900,7453,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,612,Somehow I knew it would evolve into this.
7485,7453,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,612,"Elementary, my dear Watson. This crime scene has been staged."
7193,7453,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,612,Have we any creationists in the database?

6024,7453,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,612,Look: they're leading right to us!
5979,7453,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,612,We've come along way baby!
5727,7453,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,612,"Evolutionary, my dear Wanda."
5696,7453,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,612,"Yes, the crime scene keeps evolving."

5604,7453,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,612,"Officer, who drew those Darwin’s?"
1159,7453,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,612,We will figure out who killed Keith Haring
9085,7453,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,612,The investigation may evolve slowly....
1004,7453,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,612,What have we got? Everyone and his brother here?
1135,7453,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,612,Looks like he died out...
246,7453,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,612,I feel like I've been on this case for eons.
321,7453,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,612,It's more than last time but I still don't get it.
476,7453,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,612,But this is just my theory.
9021,7453,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,612,I think we should look up his mother side of the family
751,7453,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,612,Must've been that pesky Darwin again.
910,7453,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,612,I hope we can solve this one before another million years goes by.
912,7453,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,612,The family feud goes way back.
713,7453,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,612,This murder has really evolved
