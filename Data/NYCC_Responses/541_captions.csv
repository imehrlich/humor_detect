Let me guess...the Gym Reaper?
You must be kidding. I've got tickets for 'Hamilton' tonight.
We're divorced---but I'd be delighted to give you his current address.
No, I get it. I just think it's a little insulting that he sends an intern.
It's for you honey
So this is your idea of "dressed to kill"?
Harold, it’s for you.
We divorced 10 years ago, but I'll be happy to give you his address.
He's in the kitchen washing the toaster.
Well, if it isn't the Gym Reaper.
Yeah well, you don't look like your Tinder profile picture, either.
Good luck getting him off the couch.
When he finishes the dishes.
Honey, it's for you!
The last man in my life and still a disappointment.
I was planning to move to Canada, but this works too.
Any wheat you need reaped, or your husband, lover, neighbors, etc?
No, I'm not ready. This is just the way I look without my makeup.
You call that dressed to kill?
Hold on. Let me get my husband.
He's out right now but as long as you're here could you trim the hedge?"
Come back on Nov. 9th and I’ll let you know.
He moved out, but I'll get you his new address.
Thank God you're here. One more debate and I would've done it myself.
No, I won't "Like, go with you and stuff."
Sure. Just let me get his Netflix password before you talk to him.
Come back on November the 9th and we'll talk.
Get a life.
I see fashion's dead, too.
So much for death with dignity.
Believe me, if he still lived here, I'd tell you.
Can you wait till he finishes doing the dishes?
You are persuasive, but I'm still voting for Hillary.
I'd invite you in, but I guess I don't live here anymore.
He's on the treadmill.
Sorry, Billy won't be harvesting any souls until he finishes his homework.
Who are you here for? Actually, how many can you take?
He's not home but you're welcome to wait.
Good, you're here. I'll go get my husband.
Grim, huh? I'll show you grim. He's on the couch in his underwear.
I'm just glad to see a millennial with a job.
Thank God, I thought it was another Jehovah's Witness.
You're too late. I'm already in hell.
Well, I'll be damned.
Just my luck, I get the intern.
Thank goodness. I was afraid you were a clown.
You look different from your profile picture.
Dressed to kill, I see.
I chose liberty.
Thank goodness! I was afraid you might be a clown.
Can he run a few errands first ?
George...it's for you.
You look like hell.
You want to move back home for a while? Over my dead body.
And what are you supposed to be -- the Gym Reaper?
I'll get my husband.
Ironically, he's in the living room.
Well if your little walk through the valley of the shadow of death goes through my living room, you're going to need to take your shoes off because I just vacuumed.
You look more like the gym reaper, if you ask me.
So good to see you, I was afraid I was going to have to vote this year.
Nice shoes and sweats. You must be the Gym Reaper!
Finally! He's in the den.
I can't come: I'm being audited.
Herb stepped out for a carton of cigarettes, but you probably knew that.
Thanks for coming on such short notice. He's snoring again.
Sure you are. And I'm the Easter Bunny.
Oh good, I thought you were a Jehovah's Witness.
It figures: I just paid my taxes.
I don't care why you missed curfew. If Pestilence, Famine, and Death jumped off a bridge, would you jump too?
He's relaxing in the tub with a martini and a few vicodin. Why?
What happened to Death with dignity?
Trump won, didn't he?
All right, don't tell us. Dad and I are just happy you got any job at all.
You don't scare me, I'm a teacher.
well, at least I won't have to witness another presidential debate.
A hoodie? That could get YOU killed.
If Trump wins, I'm all yours.
Don't go out wearing that hoodie, you'll make people nervous.
You aren't reaping anything, mister, until that room is clean.
I only support pro-life candidates.
So, what now...NO lives matter?
You're late. I did him myself.
You don't look anything like your Tinder photo.
I knew you'd get here before the Cable Guy!
Great! I'll go get him.
You're not exactly dressed to kill.
What do you mean, the regular guy died?
You look more like the Grim Rapper.
Typical! I get to die on Casual Friday.
Sorry -- I ran out of Candy. Will Harold do?
Seriously? The grim rapper?
Your scythe was much bigger in your profile pic.
I'm not going anywhere. This place is rent controlled.
So I take it he wasn't at the gym?
Well since we're being casual, how about just giving me the flu?
No, Jimmy can not come out and play dead.
Honey - Someone at the door for you.
You know, you only get one chance to make a last impression.
I would love to give you his new address.
We decided to go with hospice instead.
I hope you realize that most Angels of Death don't live in their parents' basement.
And take me off your mailing list, too.
Could you come back after he finishes cleaning the basement?
We’re divorced, John no longer lives here—LET ME GIVE YOU HIS ADDRESS.
Well, well, well; if it isn't the Grim Rapper.
Sorry, I beat you to him.
It never occurred to me that Death would observe casual Friday.
My husband isn't home, but I would appreciate it very much if you would wait for him.
If you don't mind, I'd like to see some ID.
Well, how was practice?
"I really wasn't expecting the 'Gym Reaper'".
Let me guess, Casual Friday the 13th?
You look more like the Grim Rapper to me.
It's the grim rapper!
For the record, I'd like to say that I told him to hire an electrician.
No, thanks. We didn't sow anything this year.
A man finally knocks on my door and look who it is.
He's at the golf course with his mistress. I can provide you with the GPS coordinates.
Oh, the perfect ending to a crappy day.
The Grim Rapper?
I thought I had a date with Destiny.
Dressed to kill, you're not.
The Grim Rapper, I presume.
It's about time. He's downstairs in the den.
Grim rapper? Right.
Oh, sure – and I'm the Virgin Mary.
First tell me the good news.
Since the divorce, he no longer lives here but I'll be happy to give you his new address.
Jerry, it's for you.
He's out celebrating. He thought your appointment was yesterday.
Thank you for coming. My other option was divorce.
He's in the den, wearing a "Make America Great" baseball cap.
Hang on a sec...I wouldn't be caught dead in this sweater.
Oh, it's the gym reaper!
You look more like the Gym Reaper.
Thank God. I thought you were one of those, "Get out the vote," people.
Well, well, if it isn't the Grim Slacker.
You'll have to wait. He's being audited.
I wouldn't be seen dead with you.
Let me guess, you're here to 'unfriend' me...
You must be the grim rapper.
Oh, good. I was afraid you were a Mormon.
Yes, we're still undecided.
The sweatsuit hoodie says, 'Look at me, I'm Death, I live in my mom's basement.'
Let me get my husband for you.
Death be not proud, but have a little self respect.
He just applied for life insurance. Come back next month.
Oh, look, it's the Grim Rapper.
Over my dead body will I leave this rent-controlled apartment.
For God's sake - get a life.
Well I'm all out of candy. What happens now?
I wasn't expecting the Gym Reaper.
At least you're not a clown.
I guess the election results are in.
YES, you still have to take your shoes off.
Not if I see him first.
You couldn't have shown up BEFORE this election cycle?!
He is not here. How about my mother-in-law?
You can find him at Paddy's, and you can tell him I told him so.
I knew the tuna tasted funny.
The back yard, weed it and reap.
I see outrunning you is not an option.
Honey, I don't want to do Airbnb anymore.
I knew millennials would be the death of me.
That outfit alone is killing me.
You could've dressed up a bit! This is kind of a big day for me!
I think you're looking for my husband.
You need to get a life.
Over my dead body.
If you're not taking your job seriously, why should I?
Are you here for the Republican Party?
He's still not home from skydiving.
I believe we already spoke on the phone, when I tried to cancel my cable.
Stand up straight and take your hand out of your pocket.
Well, he's dead to me too.
I thought I heard the doorbell toll.
Thanks for coming on such short notice. He's in the bathroom.
Figures I would die on Casual Friday.
I got tired of waiting, so I just did it myself.
About time; he's in the den.
Do I have time to take a shower?
I don't care who you are–he's grounded until Monday.
You're not taking my mother out dressed like that.
No, Plague and Famine can't come out and play. They're grounded.
I'm thinking maybe Amber can't go out tonight.
Well, your Match.com photo isn't exactly accurate, either.
He's due back in 15 minutes. In the meantime could you do the back lawn?
Im here for the Bris.
Well, I finally get to see Trump's healthcare plan.
You're as disappointing as the rest of my life.
If you’ve come for my girlish figure, my libido, or my faith in human decency—you’re too late.
Oh, thank goodness, for a moment I thought you were a clown!
What do you mean it's like unfriending, only longer?
Someone to see you,dear .
Well at least you're not a clown.
Oh dear. What I said was: My ideal date would be "slim" and "a keeper."
It was the sushi, wasn't it...
I gave my soul at the office
Well, you're not exactly dressed to kill either.
I don't care for whom the bell tolled. You're still grounded.
Sorry, I died at the office.
Donald? There's someone here from the RNC
Across the hall. All of them.
It froze over?
Just give me a moment and I'll go and fetch my mother in law
You're selling subscriptions to Life?
For Christ's sake even Death is younger than me
Not today, Death. Why don't you jog your way to 7b? She's a smoker.
You sure don't look like your profile picture.
Check back with me on November 9th.
Thanks for the offer, but we have a riding mower.
If you don't take those shoes off you'll be the one getting carried out of here.
Before you take my husband, any chance you can trim the hedges?
Well, I guess it's better than waiting for the elections
You're not taking my daughter anywhere dressed like that.
I thought you'd be taller.
Was it the salmon mousse?
I might vote for you considering the alternatives
Wait here. I'll get him.
Well it's about time! He's on the couch.
It's about time! He's in the bedroom.
Come on in. But, just so you know, he's already dead to me.
So, white is the new black.
At least someone still makes house calls.
He's with his mistress. I'll give you her address if you'll take both of them.
Honey, there's someone from 'no lives matter' here to see you
He's in the shower. Coffee?
Death be not proud, eh?
I just need a minute to put on clean underwear.
He's the one in the bedroom with the knife sticking out of his chest.
I wouldn't be caught dead in that outfit.
Please tell me you weren't out reaping souls in THAT.
Thank God! I was afraid you were a clown.
Well you don't look anything like your profile picture either.
I was just going to vote. Perfect timing.
I got better
Well, ain't this a scythe for four-eyes!
If it isn't the Grim Rapper.
Let me guess--we're not going somewhere fancy.
I'm hoping you're about to say, "Trick or treat."
No, I very clearly said I wanted you to Skype me.
I see it's casual Friday.
My neighbor has the Note 7. I have an iPhone.
Why, if it isn't the Gym Reaper ...
I do live here, and even have the same name, but I'm not her.
I might go quietly, but never casually.
...The GYM Reaper?
Well, you don't look like your profile pic either.
I thought you'd never come.... he's in the living room.
Thanks but I think I'll wait for the next Uber driver.
Oh sure, NOW you show up. Where were you during the debates?
How would I know if my husband changed his jogging route?
If you're looking for my husband's libido, I already killed it with this outfit
Would it kill you to put on a nice cloak?
Why can't you just carry a skateboard like your friends?
Don't wear the hoodie. You'll scare people.
Perfect timing. He's just finishing dessert.
Tell you what -- you give those hedges a quick trim, and I'll bring Harold out with no fuss.
I'd like to use one of my lifelines.
I don't care if you're here to take who-ever to the great what-ever, take your shoes off!
Frankly I was hoping for something grimmer.
I like the new look! It's definitely less grim.
... I'd still like to see some identification.
Can you come back later when my husband is home?
I was supposed to get a text when you were ten minutes away.
Somebody to see you, Harry!
I'll give you $20 to cut the grass and another $500 if you take my husband.
can I see some ID
So, you're just going to casually end it?
Stand straight. Hand out of pocket. Look grim."
Trim the hedges, and take care of the neighbors while you're at it.
Why can't you go through a normal goth phase?
My underwear is clean. Let's do this.
Is this Casual Doomsday?
Sorry, but we're happy with our current service provider.
You need to get rid of that hoodie, it scares people.
At least I can stop worrying about who to vote for!
Oh, thank God you're here – this election has been slow torture.
Dude, all lives matter.
You could have tolled.
Hello darkness, my old friend.
My mother-in-law is in the kitchen.
What is it, casual Friday the 13th?
You're in the wrong hood.
This is my last blind date.
Not now!...I finally like myself!
Is my time up or are you canvassing for Trump?
I can't believe you got past the doorman.
Actually, his son. The Grim Rapper.
I can't even get a respectable death
I ate all that kale for nothing!
Yeah, definitely less grim.
NOW you show up. My mother-in-law left 2 hours ago!
I just got a call--someone here said they'd rather die than go to Aunt Helen's for Thanksgiving.
I'm not going anywhere with you in those sweatpants.
If I had to wear that ensemble for eternity, I'd want to kill everyone, too.
An alternative to Clinton and Trump? I'm listening.
Would it have killed you to dress up a little?
Just the weeds around back. I'll take care of the old man.
You couldn't just text?
He'll be so disappointed, this is his poker night.
Death is on vacation—I'm Casualty.
Your Tinder profile claimed you had a bigger scythe.
Let me guess, you must be the Grim Rapper.
Where have you been? I was scared I'd have to vote.
Larry, someone's here for you.
We don't take death so casually in this house.
Since when does Death observe Casual Friday?
'Let me guess. The Grim Jogger?'
I don't care who you think you are. You'll leave your shoes in the hall.
No offense, but you look like hell!
You looked more sinister in your profile picture.
I take it we're not going out.
Why yes, I did boo Hillary Clinton at a campaign rally. Why?
How was the Trump rally?
I would rather pay more taxes
If you took your job more seriously you wouldn't have missed him.
The last time you cut the lawn all my flowers died.
Well I don't care what fate says, I'm his mother and I say he's grounded.
I told you the neighbors get freaked out when you cut the grass like that.
If you're looking for the Republican party, you're too late.
This really isn't a good time.
I asked for someone to trim the creeper...
I suppose it's pointless to try to outrun you.
You're taking my death too casually.
Fine. You can come in. But the other three guys and the horses stay outside.
Oh thank God, I was afraid I might make it until November.
He's already on the mantel.
No, that's next door......but can you take me? I can't watch another debate.
This is the last time I'll complain about my pizza not being sliced.
Finally, a man who matches his profile.
Some of us don't accept death so casually.
For whom the doorbell tolls
Can you give me a minute to sign my donor card?
You reap, but you can't sew?
Sorry, but we buy our scythes online.
Let me guess. You're looking for the Republican Party.
Forget a tip! You killed the dog and left my husband.
Too menacing. Lose the hoodie.
You don't look anything like your picture.
At least dress like you care!
Can I see some identification?
Why do you have to end it so casually?
Come back November 9th. I may need your services then.
Give me a minute to see if his insurance is paid up, then he's all yours.
Not Now! The Cubs may get into the World Series!
Sorry, after Trump nothing scares me.
That better be the stench of death on your breath young man.
Casual Death Day?
Slacker! I died two weeks ago.
He's dead to me, too.
You're too late. I killed him last week."
I think I'll call another Uber driver.
I didn't say I'd rather die, then exercise. I said I'd rather die than exercise.
That is not how you looked in your profile picture.
A boy in a hoodie shows up at my door and wants to date my daughter? Over my dead body!!
You look nothing like your profile picture.
No, Timmy cannot come out and die!
I wish the cable guy was as reliable as you.
You look like death.
And the pizza?
No thanks. I died at the office.
And who should I say is calling?
Yes, I did say that I'm dead on my feet, but I didn't mean that literally.
Well, you don't have to be so casual about it.
This is 'Street' not 'Place.'
You must be the exterminator
I still don't see why you need my email address.
Sweats and a hoodie? So much for death with dignity.
Sure, I'll give a donation. The scythe's the limit.
Oh good. I was afraid it was one of those clowns.
Please tell me it's Halloween.
Sure, come on in...I just heard they're going to have a fourth presidential debate.
Sure, you're scary; not clown scary, but scary.
You don't look like you are taking this job seriously.
You're late. My mother-in-law left ten minutes ago.
Where's the kid that usually cuts the lawn?
So death takes a casual Friday, huh.
No...no...no. You must be mistaken. We have a rent controlled apartment; we never die, we don't even fade away.
If you're Death, my husband is in the living room. If you're not, the costume party is upstairs.
Have you tried texting him?
Well it's about time! He's in the back.
He's drunk, asleep, and in his man cave. Feel free to let yourself in.
You're late. I've been dead inside for years.
Would it have killed you to dress the part?
Sorry, this is apartment 665.
You don’t look anything like your profile picture.
Well what do you know... if it isn't the Grim Rapper.
I wouldn't be caught dead with you in that outfit.
This is exactly why we added ourselves to the DO NOT REAP list years ago.
How much to scare the hell out of my husband?
He'll be lucky if you find him before I do.
This is a rent-controlled apartment. The real Mrs. Peterson died three years ago.
He's in the chair in the den, make it snappy, I've got Hamilton tickets.
Please tell me you're just here for the candy.
You can tell Mitch McConnell or whoever sent you, YOU HAVE THE WRONG RUTH GINSBERG!
I was hoping for a more dignified death
The only thing dead around here is my sex life.
I'll tell you what's grim - a middle aged guy out in public wearing sweatpants and a hoodie.
Let me guess - you're the Grim Rapper?
Are you the casual reaper?
What do you mean "you see dead people?"
No hard feelings, it's a common mistake. I'm Bobbi and he's Bobby. Honey, you have a visitor.
You don't scare us, we're rent-controlled.
My husband saw you ring the bell, and asked me to get it.
Better than most guys I've dated, at least you have a job.
Sorry, but we were looking for someone with a lawn mower.
Do you mind if we take a selfie first?
If you take him, take the Play Station too.
You're too late. I couldn't stand it any longer. I killed him myself.
Kinda casual for a Day of Reckoning, no?
Death? The death of fashion, maybe.
Sorry, you missed him again. Mr. Richards went on tour with the Stones.
I wouldn't be caught dead with you dressed like that.
I'm sorry, but according to the state of New York his soul belongs to me.
Its about time. He's upstairs.
I don't care about your other job, please fix the toilet.
Hello Betty, I'm here regarding your Federal student loans.
You looked friendlier in your profile picture
Wait, the Grim Rapper?
Seems a little expensive for yard work.
Just my luck, dying on Casual Friday.
Could you come back after the election? I'll be ready about then.
Sorry, I'm voting for the pro-life candidate.
Can I see an ID?
I get it. I should've jogged more.
No, last time I hired you to trim the hedges, they all died.
Excuse me Ma'am, I'd like to take a minute of your time to tell you what Donald J.Trump can do for the future of America.
I expected a date with Destiny
A scythe salesman, my ass!
But it's Halloween, not Election Day.
I'm like... here for your soul or whatever.
No, I'm sorry. I'm a registered Democrat.
Wipe your feet.
Mom, I got a job!
I'd ditch the hoodie. It makes you look sinister.
Whatever happened to dying with dignity!
Let me guess, you're here to grab me in the Pussy?
My husband? He's the guy shoveling snow in the driveway.
He's not in. Is it something specific that you're calling about?
Explain to me again what the Junior Reapers is.
Are we still on for Election Day?
You're late.. he had a heart attack last week!
This is my last Tinder date.
What are you doing here? Who's coaching the Patriots?
Second bedroom on the left.
As if the scythe isn't intimidating enough, you had to wear a hoodie too?
Sorry, I already died at the office.
Come back when you're dressed to kill.
He's at the golf course! Aren't you supposed to know that?
Take your hand out of your pocket, don't slouch , get some real shoes. If you think I'm going anywhere with you, think again, mister.
Why so grim?
I warned you not to get a Liberal Arts degree.
Would it kill you to dress up a little?
I was expecting the exterminator.
Do you really think you're dressed to kill?
This is how you dress to visit your mother?
Well at least you're not the tax man.
Please tell me you're here to cut the lawn.
You fool! You could be killed walking around this neighborhood with a hoodie!
I'm feeling just fine. Why do you ask?
Is it about the hedge?
Finally.
Honey you have a caller
You've been out giving the other runners heart attacks, haven't you?
Would you mind waiting until he's in the shower?
Do me a quick favor. Go down to 14B and scare the hell out of my ex-husband while I grab my coat.
You think you scare me? The last trick-or-treater was a clown.
You sure know to kill a knock knock joke!
I was expecting someone a little older.
Are you here about the gas leak?
I have news for you. You're at my door. I'm not at yours.
The Trump rally is downstairs
I didn't expect you until November 8th.
Tell me more about this farm upstate.
Sorry, I support death with dignity.
"You're late...I already took care of him".
Well, it's about time! He's on the couch. We'd like to keep the remote.
What is this? Casual Friday the 13th?
Another job swooped by a damn millennial.
I'll take the "treat"
First day on the job?
You seem awfully casual about this.
I'll be with you in a minute. I've got to put my vote for Hillary in the mail.
I ordered Chinese.
I was never informed about an early termination fee.
Well, would you look at that! It's the Grim Rapper!
Not a Terminator. I called for an Exterminator.
You don't look anything like your photo in Match.com.
No, I haven't heard of 'Casualty Friday'...
Well if it isn't the prodigal son! Finally found a job, I see. Well come on in, don't just stand there letting the heat out. Your father and I aren't made of money, you know. I swear, you kids will be the death of me.
Send someone else, I prefer death with dignity .
You could have at least dressed to kill.
You're too late. He voted early.
You know what's grim? Your wardrobe.
I don't care who you are--I'm not voting for him!
My husband will be back in half an hour. You're welcome to wait.
Come on in. He's hiding in the closet.
In your case, I'm not coming unless I see some I.D.
Did you bring my cigarettes?
Can you come back when my husband is home?
I don't care if it's Casual Friday. You're not reaping my soul in sneakers.
If Trump wins, ring again.
"What were those options again?'
Well you misheard her... I was not dying to meet you!!!
Yeah, I know, business is dead. Your dinner is in the oven.
Just so you know, you don't look like your profile pic either....
Well, I'd rather you mowed the lawn.
That's a very compelling pitch, but I'm still voting for Hillary.
You're early. He's at the health club.
Are you on my doorstep, or am I on yours?
Trump won?
Really? My number had to come up on a casual Friday?
John said he'd rather die than go jogging this early?
And I suppose you brought home dirty laundry too?
I don't care if the other 3 horsemen are going. You're getting too old to go Trick or Treating.
You're a week early for Halloween, and 10 years late on my marriage.
Sorry, dude, I died at the office.
You must be here for my husband.
Trust me. I'll take any interruption from watching these debates.
Before you take him would you mind thinning out the tall grass?
Thanks, but we usually use a power lawnmower!
My husbands not home right now. But please, come in.
Do you have to be so casual about it?
Would you mind coming back tomorrow? I still have 3000 steps to get in today.
No, this is not the Republican Headquarters
No, we hired the kid with the lawn mower.
Well you sure took your sweet time getting here. I was about to give up and take care of him myself.
You must be here for my husband's sense of humor.
Sorry, what is the "Angel of Def"?
No thanks, our son cuts our lawn.
Don't bother, my husband has been dead since our honeymoon!
But I thought we had until November 8th!
Can you come back in about twenty-five minutes? He's fixing the sink.
Thank God, I thought it was another creepy clown.
Oh, you must be here to see my husband!
Treat?
Vote or Die? Well, make it quick then.
I don't care what plague she caused, I'm still voting Democrat.
Well, in or out? I don't have all night!
GOP Headquaters is next door.
'He's over at Trump Tower.'
Come back November 9.
Sorry, I already gave my life at the office.
I was expecting someone much older.
What, is this all I get -- some punk trainee?
Sorry, my hip's already killing me.
You look nothing like your profile.
You're early. I specifically said Election Day.
You got a job doing what?
Sorry, you're too late! I have already given my life to my over demanding boss, my obnoxious husband and my spoiled children.
Please excuse the sweatsuit ma'am. I've been too busy reaping to sew.
He's around back, tinkering with the wood chipper.
And taxes. Got it.
I'm afraid there's been a mistake. I told the doorman to send up Beth.
You're a bit late - all his interesting parts died 5 years ago.
If you hurry you can catch him on the first tee.
If it's all the same to you young man, I'd prefer not to chill.
Death may not be proud -- but can't you at least put in the effort?
Hold on. I'll let my husband know you're here.
Why the new look? Your old outfit was to die for..
Well thank goodness its not another charity. Sure come in, he's in the kitchen.
What a slob. I wouldn't be caught dead with you.
Sorry about the wait. I thought you were a Jehovah's Witness
Well you took your sweet time, he started breathing again.
He's gone out for a carton of cigarettes, a quart of gin, and hotdogs for dinner. You want to come in and wait?
My husband will be right with you.
finally! let me just grab my purse.
Sweatpants? Death definitely be not proud.
Do you guys have casual Fridays too?
Trump Tower is next door.
I opened the door before you knocked so it doesn't count.
Come in. Pestilence is in his room.
You're late. He's taken a position with the Trump campaign.
"It's about time. The republicans have been wishing for you to show up.
Upstairs, bedroom to the left.
Are you sure? There's a lot of Mrs. Smiths.
I'm married to your brother. I died along time ago.
I thought I hit unsubscribe.
Hubby, there's someone at the door for you.
So, he took up jogging for nothing?
Nice try, sweetie, but your student loans are still your responsibility.
Believe me, after the day I've had, you're welcome.
You have the wrong home. I eat kale.
It's just the nurse, honey. They sent a different one tonight.
What a relief....I thought you were going to be a clown.
You must be the stripper.
" Only you can prevent Donald Trump.
Oh, thank goodness. I was expecting another door-to-door campaigner.
It's about time! He's in the living room.
Young man, you're more than welcome to harvest my soul, but take your shoes off first.
You're late again. We made other arrangements.
Now is not a good time.
You're late. We buried him last week.
Do I need to remind you this is a 'stand your ground' state?
I heard you have death by chocolate.
Aw man, did I forget to take my medication?
So you're saying it doesn't matter how I vote?
Please put me on your "Do Not Call" list.
May I take a message?
Sorry, he went to hell in a handbasket.
If you say "I totally killed it" again, we're done.
The Grim Reaper doesn't wear velcro sneakers. Earl, what do you want?
No, I don't know what time it is!
Will I still have time to file an absentee ballot
When I said that casserole was 'to die for' you didn't actually think I meant it did you?
Your're almost too late. One more day of this campaign and I was going to do it myself.
You want scary? Put on the clown costume.
I should have swiped left.
Well, we're out of candy. What's your trick?
You don't really look like your profile picture
I thought you were opportunity knocking.
The scythe is still a dead giveaway.
I appreciate the offer, really, but can I get back to you on November 9th?
You're late. After I caught him with the secretary, I did him myself.
I don't care who you are; you'll wipe your feet if you're coming in my apartment.
Listen, I’m not paying you by the hour if you don’t have a lawnmower.
Sure, you can take him, but clear the weeds when you leave.
I died at the office.
You think I'm going anywhere with you dressed like that?
You looked much different in your profile picture.
Before you do my husband, could you do the weeds in the back lot ?
Who? Never heard of her.
'Sup? Is that all I get? 'Sup?
My lawn or my life?
Finally, You Got a JOB!
Whew! I thought it was going to be a clown.
You don't look like your profile picture either.
I cut my own grass..
My mother-in-law will be back at 5:30.
No, no.... I just represent the death to all your plans to exercise this week. I'm his brother, Gym Reaper.
Please give me until Nov 8th. After that life won't be worth living.
Trendy. Is it one-scythe-fits-all?
Well, 'yo' yourself.
OK, I get it. I need to exercise.
Well, I do like the idea of a landscaping company that doesn't use leaf blowers or gas mowers.
Sorry, I meant to swipe left.
No famine can't come out to play
No, the Reapers live next door.
Sorry Barry, that is so 2015, this year its creepy clowns
I don't know why, but I always imagined you'd be taller than me.
I don't plan to pay my taxes either.
Honey, your Amazon order is here.
Thanks for coming on such short notice
Well at least you finally got a job.
Look, when I said I would die if Brad and Angelina broke up, it was just a metaphor!
I'm afraid you're mistaken. I called for a gym sweeper.
If you run, you might be able to reap him at Starbucks.
Let me guess - you dropped out of Stanford to start your own business.
Well! That's the last time I set up a date on the Internet.
I'm not Mrs. Finkel, and the Mr. Finkel you're looking for retired and moved to Florida last year. Don't you have Facebook?
Your too late, he made a deal with the devil.
We already have a lawn guy
Let me get my mother-in-law. She's in the kitchen.
The co-op board president is in 2B.
I think your profile picture is outdated.
Done with the GOP already?
I thought you would be taller.
And what exactly is the Casual Reaper supposed to do?
The Trump campaign headquarters are two doors down.
How about I let you know after election day?
But I eat a ton of kale!
Let me vote first.
You're here with the election results?
Casual Friday, I assume?
DONALD!! Your campaign manager is here!
Oh thank God. I thought it was a creepy clown.
Finally, a choice in this election.
You don't scare me. I'm voting for Hillary.
Would you mind coming back tomorrow. He promised to finish painting today.
It was only a joke I made when I thought Trump had a lead.
We have a regular lawn service, thank you.
Even my angel of death is disappointing.
Yeezus, you look like death!
You don't scare me. I watched Trump at the debates.
Dying I can accept. It's the Casual Friday thing that bugs me.
Don't give me that look.
You look nothing like your profile photo.
I'm not one to stereotype, but that hoodie might make others wary of you.
It worked. No one bullied me.
But first, could you whack the weeds?
I would rather we continue to skype.
My husband isn't here right now. Can you come back later?
Look, this isn't a good time.
I was expecting someone taller.
Must you bring your work home with you?
What do mean 'the game went into sudden death'?
So Death takes holidays and casual Fridays as well!
Didn't you read the sign? No soliciting!
I have Hamilton tickets for next week!
If you're looking for the Republican Party, I'm afraid Mr. Trump got here before you.
Amazon really does deliver everything.
My worst nightmare? Oh, please--I survived campaign season.
For some events in life, there really should be a dress code.
I wish I could wear sweatpants to work.
What the hell do you want ?
Well, this is disappointing – I thought you were taller.
Well, it's a sewing circle, not sowing circle, but you're welcome to join.
I hate to profile, but what's up with the hoodie ?
I was afraid of that! Trump won!
You knew it was going to be a dead end job.
Careful, that hoodie makes you look threatening
What are my options again?
Actually, death does not become you.
It's either Halloween or Election Day.
I don't pay taxes either!
At least it's not a clown
Well, you've got the wrong Hortensia Maria von Klootz!
Would it kill you to wear a robe?
Come back tomorrow when my husband is at home.
"You want the Trump Campaign Office - that's down the street and third building on your left".
Tough day at the office? You look like death
I gave at the cemetery.
Why the hoody? You think I don't know who you are?
You're telling me those were amanitas and not portobellos?
I think you want my husband.
Come back later. I'm only on season 2 out of 5.
I already did that part. You were suppose to bring a mop.
Thank God! When I heard the knock I thought you were a politician.
You must be here for American Democracy.
You're certainly treating this whole thing a bit too casually for my tastes.
Simply head up to the penthouse... he has orange hair.
You illegals are taking all the good jobs.
He's working late at the office again. You can get him there.
I'll be ready for you as soon as I finish Game of Thrones.
Christ! You just missed him.
Hell has casual Friday?
Who are you supposed to be- the grim Rapper?
Stop right there! We're on the Do Not Call List
Who are you, the Grim Sneaker?
I guess I won't be able to outrun you.
Who knew Death could be so casual...
I thought you said you were taking me out tonight.
I thought I was ordering Death By Chocolate
We won't be needing you. He killed himself during the last debate.
Reaping the benefits of the gym, I see?
I thought you'd never get here. He's in the back room.
I'm feeling much better, thanks for asking.
At least I'll die laughing!
This is unit A. Death's door is unit B.
I already gave my soul at the office.
Well, I sure hope today is Halloween.
What a coincidence! I just finished doing my taxes.
What are you? The Gym Reaper?
I'm guessing you're here to take me out?
I told you, you're dead to me.
Arnold is on the couch, but it's new so try not to make a mess.
He's in the living room watching football.
You want the guy next door. He's a deplorable.
Thank goodness, I don't have to vote.
Let's stop kidding ourselves; nothing is going to make me exercise more.
I'll show you grim, Howard. Get your ass in here.
Seriously? That's what you're wearing?
I was expecting tall, dark, and gruesome.
You look a lot different in person
Your'e too late, he died yesterday
First the sombrero, then the hajib, now this...I'm still voting for Hillary.
I guess I shouldn't be surprised. I told my daughter to find someone a little more serious...
Would it kill you to wear something more formal?
Worst blind date ever.
I'm sorry. We don't need any more cutlery.
I don't have any candy. Take my husband.
Death be not so fashionable either.
If you're coming for me, mister, you're coming properly dressed!
John, come in out of the cold. You look like death!
You millennials kill me.
Over my dead body am I letting you in here.
You want the smokers next door.
He's in his recliner...
Figures...I get taken on casual Friday.
Sorry, we already have Obamacare!
More like "grimy" reaper, I'd say.
I don't fear the reaper. Now go clean your room.
So, what are you suppose to be, the Grim Slacker?
I've been knocking at death's door for years, why haven't you answered?
Couldn't you have given me some notice? I would've maxed out my credit cards.
Take a seat, my ex should be here any minute
This is what he gets for dying on 'casual' Friday.
I'm no longer undecided.
I said I wanted a COMFORTABLE death, not a CASUAL one!
Would it have killed you to dress up before coming over?
Exterminator?
No thanks we have a lawn service.
When you're finished reaping, clean up your room!
No...I'm for Hillary.
The sign outside clearly says no soulisciting.
He said to come back later. He's doing his Absentee Ballot.
I'm not coming until you change.
What do you mean, you're not trick-or-treating?
If he has not paid taxes in 18 years, what makes you think he will go with you?
Does your mother know what you do for a living, young man?
Believe me, I would tell you where he went if I knew.
This is not death's door!
We ordered a stripper.
Thank God. I was hoping you'd find me before November 8.
Sorry, no one is home.
Do I look like I want to die?
No, sneakers and sweats don't make you any more relatable.
Come in he's been waiting to meet you his whole life.
Perfect timing, the presidential debate just started.
Excuse me, ma'am, do you have a few minutes to discuss the future of the Republican Party?
Wrong house. The Trump campaign is across the street.
I suppose you're going to grab me by the pussy?
Your clown outfit was scarier .
I knew you'd be the death of me.
Could I see some identification?
Let me guess. Casual Friday?
I take it they were all out of clown costumes.
Would it kill you to dress up for date night?
Sorry, not til if find out if I'm a finalist in the Caption Contest.
Am I glad to see you -- he's just taken his first Viagra.
You couldn't have come before the election season?
I thought that the UberDeath app was just a joke...
I don't care what the teacher in your Grim Reaper training class says, scythe does matter.
Apartment 2B is next door. This is not 2B.
You make some compelling arguments, but before I commit to a yard sign I need you to explain how he plans to "make America great again."
Can you come back after Election Day?
Long black robe in the dryer?
When I said Get a job, this wasn't what I had in mind.
Finally a date that looks like his picture.
''That's it, Zuckerberg. I'm Un-friending you"
Wait right there, let me grab my husband.
Let me change my status.
You were out playing with that Kevorkian boy, weren't you?
Come back on November 8th
I'm sorry but this isn't a good time for me.
We just bought a lawnmower.
Thank goodness! I thought you were another pollster.
Where have you been? I've been worried sick.
I still don't believe it was the gluten.
Oh, good. You're here. I'll tell mom and dad you're ready for them.
You're just asking to get profiled, going out like that!
I've never heard of the "Whatever" Reaper!
Don't worry, I'm only the Grim Rapper.
You're right on time. He just jumped out the window.
Well it's about time! I've been dying to see you.
Is it about the shrubbery?
Oh sure... you're the Grim Reaper and I'm the freakin' Queen of England!
If you need to process this, I could take another lap or two around the block.
I don't care if everyone else is doing it, you're not leaving the house like that. Get back inside and get on that nice evil flowing black robe that your aunt gave you for your birthday.
No, sorry we're not interested in putting a Trump sign in our front yard.
Can I give you my final answer after the election?
When you're done trimming the grass you can deadhead the roses.
So, what happened? Did hell finally freeze over?
I wouldn't be caught dead going out with a guy in sweatpants.
He's snoring on the couch
Whew - I was worried it'd be a scary clown.
Please say "Trick or Treat!"
You'd better be here for the clown.
Pick up or delivery?
Come in, he's on his way home!
It's the hoodie that scares me.
He's not in, but you're welcome to wait.
I knew having Children would be the death of me!
I'm just the cleaning lady
I get it. White is the new black.
You're going to kill me but I'm all out of sugar.
We really need a better doorman.
DO YOU HAVE ANY I.D?
I'm so glad you're still working weekends. He's in the bathroom trying to clear his browser history.
Its just a clogged drain for heaven's sake...
This must be the near death experience
Yeah? Well, you also killed our dinner plans with Carol and Doug.
You think you can scare your mother with a hoodie?
I see he hired a millennial.
Would it kill you to wear slacks and shoes?
I'd drop dead before I would go anywhere with you.
One sec, I'd like to buy some more life insurance.
Son, the end of this phase can't come soon enough.
Edward, can the drama. If it's a divorce you want, just say so.
Start with the weeds in the backyard.
Come back after the third debate
You look just like your father.
ANOTHER cup of sugar?
Does this have anything to do with all the kale I've been eating?
Well isn't that a scythe for sore eyes....
Grim Rapper?
I've warned you that hoodie makes people think you're up to no good.
Don't they do this electronically nowadays?
And for this you couldn't dress up?
I already told you, you're dead to me.
Surprisingly, I'm happy not to have found a clown at my doorstep.
He'll be home any minute.
Careful wearing a hoodie in this neighbourhood. You might get yourself killed.
What happened to your 12-4 arrival window?
You're interrupting my show
Is this how eviction notices work now?
I think you are looking for my ex-husband.
"Shall I tell him who's calling?
My dad sent me, it's take your kid to work day.
So let me get this straight. On Casual Friday, you just take our beer?
First finish cleaning your room, THEN you can carry my soul to its eternal grave.
You should have thought about the robe before you took out the dry cleaner.
You said you'd be here between noon and four.
And you think you can just show up without calling?
About time! I was worried I was going to make it to November 8th.
Of course I had to die on casual Friday.
Not tonight. Plague and Famine are grounded!
I think I'm going to have to ask for some ID.
Uh-oh. I thought you were only a cliche.
You're taking me out like that?
What's grim is the way you're dressed.
I'm sorry you missed him.
I'd rather die than be seen with you dressed like that!
The emergency Republican political meeting is two houses down.
Well I'm sorry my husband's heart attack forced you out of bed.
And at least try to look grim.
So how's the internship going?
Slacker! He's already dead.
You look taller in your profile pic..
One last reason to hate Casual Fridays.
I hope you're here for my mother-in-law.
What a relief! For a second there I thought you were canvassing for Trump.
I've been looking forward to you since the 2016 election.
You must be here for my husband, please come in.
Hello Darkness my old friend. You've come to talk to me again?
Young man, if you expect to be taken seriously as a professional, you'll need to dress like one.
you're late, he left without you
I thought we were meeting at your place.
But I haven't finished my taxes.
I heard you're getting replaced by drones.
Look, I'm glad you finally found a job. But is this what you meant when you said it offered "killer hours?"
What? I thought I got an entire panel under Obamacare.
Sorry, but I'm voting for Hillary.
I don't care if you're on call, I'm not going out until you change.
Is the dress code now casual eternity?
Take my husband, please.
You're not half as scary as a clown.
If it's my time, so be it. But you're not coming in here until you wipe your feet.
You must be looking for the Trump campaign.
Yes, that's who I voted for...
You just missed him. He's at the office.
I pay $15 an hour. But use the lawnmower.
You're too early! I haven't bought my candy yet!
Relax, I'm just here for your marriage.
So the clown costume just wasn’t scary enough.
I'll take the Thin Mints.
Did I die of disappointment?
She's not home.
About time... my husband is right in the other room.
Remember our deal – don’t let Harold take the remote control.
What? ... On casual Friday?
Honey, it's the kid from the scythe repair shop.
You looked grimmer on Tinder.
Whatever I ordered online, this wasn’t it.
Son, that costume does not work at an old age home.
Are you the Ghost of Gym Memberships Past?
Could you wait 30 minutes? He's mowing the lawn now.
Not scary enough. Why don't you try a Trump mask instead?
Did hell freeze over?
I guess you realize you're old when even the Grim Reaper looks young.
He's gone to vote for Trump, but if you hurry you can get him before he pulls the lever.
Congratulations...according to Donald you're the only thing that's certain anymore.
We aren't quite ready yet... can you come back on November 9th?
Borrow a cup of sugar? Sure, but I think you know that stuff can kill you.
I'm not going with you, and don't call me 'dude'.
Yeah I ordered Take Out. Why do you ask?
Yes, I would mind if we stopped at the dry cleaners on the way.
Just follow the snoring and you'll find your man.
I don't care if you were busy making other house calls. The ad says 20 minutes or it's free.
I think you're looking for my ex-husband two doors down...
Would you mind coming back after November 8th so I can vote for Hillary?
Great, Come in, let's get this over with. Anything is better than having to vote in this Presidential election.
I didn't know there was a five box minimum for Girl Scout cookies.
My husband already died laughing when we heard Trump was running for president.
Eh, still not as grim as this election
But our computer is only a few years old.
He just left for a run. If you hurry, you might catch him.
He is hiding in the bathroom.
This wasn't the sort of edgy role play I had in mind, Harold.
Hey, it's casual doomsday.
I think you're taking your job a bit too casually.
He's out back.
That hoodie could get you shot.
He's in the back.
I could understand the mix up. I can't tell you how frustrating it is to have your identity stolen.
Unfortunately, the man of the house is not in.
Some men always come too early.
You'll have to wait; he's in the bathroom.
So Hell did freeze over?
Sorry. I'm a Clinton supporter.
Today? OK, I suppose I can use an absentee ballot.
Thank you, but my husband takes care of our lawn.
I'm sure you want my husband.
Emergency number’s on the fridge, I’ll be home by eleven.
The gardens in the back.
Would it have killed you to put on a robe?
We already have a landscape service.
Sorry, wrong addresss. What you want is Trump Tower.
You're a bit early, Trump hasn't won yet.
Young man, I told you to be home and done reaping by 11!
Well, yes; I did say you could come for me when Hell froze over.
Well, ok. Wipe your feet.
Well no wonder people are living longer.
Ugh, at least be dressed to kill.
No thanks — I'm for Hillary.
You're early. He's not up yet.
Thank God you're here. Now I have a good excuse for not voting!
That's the last time I agree to a blind date.
Does that price include edging the sidewalk?
Can you come back on November 9th?
Of course, just after I announced my retirement.
He's not home yet.
He's not here now. He ran out for a pack of smokes, unless this about second-hand smoke. Then I'm yours.
Well, we've already had a Supergirl, a Batman, and some one from Star Wars, but I'm not familiar with Ingmar Bergman.
No. I'm not having breakfast. What are you... some sort of cereal reapist?
At last. He's in the first room on the right.
This is not what your Airbnb profile looked like.
Donald Trump lives next door.
Can we wait? I just ordered a pizza.
You want 2B, this is NOT2B!
Oh great, now even the Grim Reaper is a millennial.
I assume that you're trying to appeal more to the Millennials.
Let me guess. You want to borrow the lawnmower again.
I see Casual Fridays have found their way to the Underworld.
You just missed him.
Did you forget your open carry permit?
Are you, like, Death or whatever?
We already pay a man with a power mower.
Subtle, but you're still grounded
Like if I need another surprise today.
We're not quite ready yet. Can you come back after the election?
That is a clever disguise Mr. Montieth, but as I told you on the phone, we are happy with the amount of life insurance we pesently have.
What do you mean ... "Trick or treat or else"?
I'm not going anywhere if you're dressing like that.
You dressed up for my first husband.
He said to tell you, he chose Philadelphia.
Go reap yourself!
Oh I see,Death does take a holiday!
"Grim" does not mean "schlubby"!
No, I'd rather not hear about God's plan.
November 8th is here already?
He'll be back in a minute. Please come in and wait.
Trump campaign headquarters is two doors down.
Did you finish the lawn?
You couldn't dress for this?
Death is really more of a formal affair.
Seriously?!
Sorry, but I don't own a Samsung.
Really?" "The doorbell?" "Don't you knock anymore?
No, You can't have a cup of sugar.
Didn't you see the No Soliciting sign?
Really...Casual Friday?
No, Timmy cannot come out and die; he's finishing dinner.
Please come back when he's feeling better
Fancy that...The not so grim reaper.
The other gangs have guns you know.
I don't care if it's a holiday. I want death with dignity.
And who may I say is calling?
But I turned off location services!
Finish trimming the hedges, then come get me.
For whom does the doorbell ring?
And the 'Gym Reaper' is funny how?
We do our own hedges.
Well...I was just on my way out.
I will not leave with you until you put on real pants.
Well... Death is literally at my door.
Mrs. Johnson lived next door, and the funeral was yesterday. Your father must be so proud of you.
Death takes a casual Friday.
Based on your profile pic, I thought you'd be more corporeal. And taller.
Don’t tell me. It’s Casual Friday.
You call yourself grim, I'll show you grim.
He says just give him five or ten minutes to put his pants on.
The bum's not home, but come on in and have a drink while you wait.
Let me guess; you're not selling anything.
It's all fun and games until somebody loses an eye.
Could you swing by after the elections!
Come back when you have some decent clothes and a better attitude, mister.
You still need to be home by 9.
I'm going to give you five seconds to say "Trick or Treat," and then I'm going to get nervous.
Ah, Cubs in the playoffs again, I guess.
Well I was really hoping to go "out" in style.
Come with you? Like hell I will.
Let me guess -- you've been acquired by Facebook.
Can we wait until the election's over? I might have a lot of company?
Insurance? What kind of insurance?
"Take away? I ordered take-out." Elaine Ryning, San Francisco. CA
Did somebody call for a moyle?
The co-op board has a "No Solicitations" rule...
I don't care if you're here to take who-ever to the great beyond what-ever, take your shoes off!
Oh you don't look anything like you do in your profile picture.
Well, if you're sure you have the right address, wait a minute and I will get my husband for you.
I'm sorry. It's not a good time.
It's about time - he's in the back room.
Chin up, don't slouch -- and might we manage a smile?
You're early. The election's tomorrow.
My husband will be right out. I told him to hurry up, but you know George...
Even YOU have casual Friday?
Well, lets hope your'e better than the last one they sent
At least this puts an end to my marriage.
Wouldn't you know--the last day of my life, a dress down day.
Well, technically you didn't knock. You rang the door bell so ...
Try Trump Towers!
Even death is getting a little too casual these days.
He'll be back in just a half hour. I do hope you can wait.
I need to vote for Hilary first.
How about giving me a head start then?
Sorry, we can't afford death right now.
My Mother-in -law will be right out.
Please tell me you're the plumber.
I don't think you'll be getting many treats in that get-up.
Okay, okay! I'll eat more kale.
Trump or treat.
Marvellous! I won't have to register to vote now.
You wanna see my husband, right?
Yes, this is Women for Trump-Pence Headquarters. I'm it.
No, I've never heard of 'Casual Die-day.'
I'm not going with you dressed like that!
No way you're coming back home! You can't tell me you're out of work!
I swore death before exercise, and now I get both?
I'm not taking you to the retirement home Halloween party dressed like that.
No, I'm not interested in joining the Cloud.
Well look who finally made it!
How about half of my soul and the rest in coupons?
I'm not sure if the 'Casual Friday' look is good for you.
That's no longer a politically correct Halloween costume.
Black clothes matter.
Whaddaya mean, neither trick nor treat/
He is dead...I did it already!
You still have to cut the lawn
Aw, c'mon! I only ate one.
Oh, come on in, he's watching television, I thought he just fell asleep.
If this is my last date, you could have at least brought flowers.
He'll be home around six. Can you come back then?
I’ve never even heard of Death Jr.
Sorry, we are voting for Hillary.
He's not here. He's never here. I don't know where he is. Or I'd gladly tell you.
You can start by pulling the weeds in the backyard.
Honestly Jack, you'll be the death of me!
Oh, no. I refuse to entertain such a casual end.
I told your father you'd be the death of me.
Well, you're about twenty years too late. He's in his barcalounger watching the game.
Can I get a rain check?
No, they're down the hall. We ordered a large pizza with pepperoni and extra cheese.
I want to see your open carry permit first.
Its fine, Fred's been in sweatpants for the last thirty years.
I don’t care if it’s casual Friday, you’re not taking me out wearing that.
Thank God it's you. I was afraid it was Bob Manoff.
Donald's in the tower across the street. Please HURRY!
Thank you, we already have a lawn service.
You're early. Come back in 2066.
Would it make a difference if I told you I was gluten-free?
Well, if you're not willing to take my husband could you at least cut the grass.
Scythe, Shmythe. Where's the pizza?
No, really, just cut the tall grass in the back, and leave it at that.
Looking killer tonight.
I'm hoping you just want candy.
Kids! Your dad is here to pick you up for the weekend... have fun!
You're only getting candy if you whack some weeds in the back.
I could've sworn I swiped left.
Can you give me a sec so I can grab my Fitbit?
Are you trick-or-treating, or looking for the Trump campaign?
That's not what I meant by "a more permanent relationship."
No, thank you, I want a formal demise.
Yes, you can go reaping, but you have to clean your room first.
Only clowns scare me.
If you're the new hospice nurse, you're too late.
You're too late. The Winged Chariot guys already took him away.
This time get the weeds out back, too.
Ghoul Scout cookies? You got to be kidding!
Who knew Death had Casual Day?
Let me get this straight; you're a kinder, gentler agent of death?
No, this is 665.
I'm sure the 'other side' sounds like fun, but I still want her in by 11:00.
I've really enjoyed our time together, but I don't think I'm ready to commit yet.
This is the last blind date I'm going on!
Follow me...my husband is in the den
What kind of escort service is this?
Oh, you don't look like your profile picture
I don't understand why you came so quick. I don't have Amazon Prime.
No, the other Horsemen can't come out to play.
Frank doesn't die here anymore.
No, I'm the Gym Reaper. I've come to kill your excuses.
I know what you're thinking: my profile picture is a bit outdated.
I see there must be a Gap between here and the afterlife.
I thought you'd be taller and darker. And, no, I don't have any plans for later.
Try next door.
You want next door.
Herbert won't come to the door. He is demanding a Death with dignity.
You look nothing like your Tinder picture.
Sorry young man your first night on the job is not going to be my last.
I'm sorry but no. That's just not an outfit to die for.
No, this is not the Trump campaign headquarters.
No Jimmy can NOT crossover because he hasn't finished his homework.
No — I don't have a minute for undead rights.
No thank you. We harvested our wheat last Friday. You might try Mrs. Rosenbaum in 8A.
Just my luck to die on Casual Friday.
I suppose you want candy too?
And don't forget to blow the clippings off the driveway.
Where do you want to take my soul dressed like that ? To the mall ?
Now I see why the low Angie's List rating.
You could've dressed up to take me out.
So, white is the new black, I'm guessing?
Thank God! Not a clown!
OK, I choose the right hand !
Jane realized that, somewhere along the line, Flirting With Death had deteriorated into Hanging Out With Death Every Damn Sunday.
The Trump sign out front is my husband's; he's out back...
Sydney, your sneakers give you away. I'm out of the peanut butter cups.
My husband is in the backyard digging a hole. I'll tell him you're here.
Yes, I know scythe matters.
You look nothing like your profile pic.
So what if I do eat gluten?
I don't care if she was "dying to meet you"
It's about time! He' inside.
Honey, can you bring my Galaxy Note 7?
So you're telling me today is casual Friday the 13th?
You already have my vote.
Wow. You look like death, warmed up.
Casualty Friday. Great.
Sorry, wrong apartment. Joe and Barbara next door are serving the salmon mousse.
You will not go to the polling booth wearing that!
Nice hoodie - does that make you the Grim Rapper?
Not until after the election.
So that wasn't an ironic profile picture.
You looked a lot different on J-Date
I understand your disappointment, but you're now competing with a well-financed pharmaceutical industry.
Haven't you heard? Trump was elected. I'm already dead!
I'm not dying on Casual Friday.
No, you may not borrow a cup of strychnine.
I thought my teenager would be the death of me.
Well, it's about time!! Do you know how many times I've been calling you people to do my lawn?! Thought I'd be dead by no--!!
Where the hell have you been? We buried Geoff last week.
No, but you can catch him on the golf course...
So I have to die on Casual Friday?
Evelyn’s date with death: “You looked taller in your profile picture.”
Perfect. I have to die on a Casual Friday.
He's working late... again. But you can wait for him on his side of the bed if you like.
She's in Assisted Living ... you'll never get her.
I wouldn't be caught dead wearing white after Labor Day.
Your father is going to kill you.
Well, there's nothing casual about a date with Death.
I'm not going anywhere until I see your credentials.
If you're here for American democracy, you're too late.
Now's not a good time. Come back on November 9th.
You don't look like your picture.
I don't care what the blade is for, you'll be well advised not to walk around this neighborhood with that hood up.
Son, I don't care how life or death your job is, I will get to your laundry when I get to it.
Aren't you a scythe for sore eyes.
Aren't you a little old for trick or treating?
You're here to grab me by the what?
Sorry, he gave it up at the office.
So you think you've been hacked?
Funny, you didn't mention the scythe on your Tinder profile.
I see athleisure has made its way to the depths of hell.
Sure, you can borrow a cup of sugar.
If you're the Grim Reaper, I'm the Good Fairy!
Should I be worried?
I WOULD have to die on casual Friday!
Are you sure you didn't see him at the gym?
You shouldn't be wearing white after Labor Day.
Talk about a casual attitude toward death.
I'm just not feeling your grimness.
Alright, jogging or reaping souls; which is it?
Are you familiar with the phrase 'Dress for success?'
You should have used a more recent profile picture.
Could you stop back on November 9th?
Let me guess. Teens for Trump?
Oh, no, talk about bad timing -- right now he's finally watching "Dancing With The Stars" with me.
Yea...my husband can come out and play....
Darn, you just missed him.
Sweatpants? You're dead to me.
So who are you? The grim hoodie?
Well, if it isn't our prodigal son, the grim rapper!
Oh, for God's sake, you're telling me they have casual Friday up there too?
Just my luck I had to die on casual Friday
They do casual Friday in Hades?
I'll take one box of Samoas-- No make that 100.
I ordered over an hour ago so I assume this will be free.
Let me guess. Mos Death?
Let me guess death takes a holiday .
I didn't know Death had a "casual Friday."
I see you think you're exempt from the " No Soliciting" sign?
You're dropping out to do this?
If I'd known this, I'd have cast my vote against Trump early.
I've never heard of casual Death Day.
Why can't you dress like the Johnson's gardener?
I told you Marvin--you're dead to me.
I was hoping you'd be taller.
Nice try, Ed, but I still won't divorce you.
Your Father and I forbid you to pledge.
You're too late. I'm already brain dead from the debates.
Y es Im Billys mother,And no he cannot come out and play with you.
The neighbor boy cuts our lawn.
At least you could've dressed for the occasion.
Thanks for asking, Mr. Grim Slacker, but my suicide attempt was three weeks ago.
Its too late. I already did him in.
Very funny. Where's the pizza?
That hoodie is going to get you shot.
If you're here for my husband I've already got rid of him.
With that hoodie, you look like death warmed over.
Oh, no. I died at the office.
Come on in. He'll be back from his run in a few minutes.
We're actually a shoes-off house.
Look mister. Black is Grim, white not so much.
You look more pathetic than grim.
He should be back shortly, if you'd care to wait.
I imagined you taller.
I've been dying to meet you.
Your services are no longer required. I just had some chocolate.
So what's this... 'Death Takes a Casual Friday'?
Let me guess -- you're from the Trump campaign.
I'm with Her.
"Listen here, you rapper, reaper, whatever you are!? Ever heard of "menopausal rage"?
You were a dead beat when I married you and you are a dead beat now.
I guess this is what I get after talking about you so casually.
I'd recognize that comb-over anywhere.
He's in the living room.
What a cute costume! But Halloween isn't until tomorr-- ... oh.
This casual Friday thing has gone too far.
What part of 'NO SOLICITORS' don't you understand?!
I know you do this all the time, but you don't need to be so casual about it.
You know that hoodie's going to get you killed one of these days.
So you've come home...must be out of clean clothes again.
'Death, be not proud' - no danger of that.
You're shorter than I expected.
You do casual Fridays?!
We're not paying taxes either
Does your boss know you dress like this for work?
Seems not so much grim as casual.
You'll never get a head in those clothes.
It's just that I've never taken a man in sweatpants seriously.
She lives next door.
You looked a lot younger in your profile.
Had to die on a casual Friday...
Casual Friday or not, I'm not going with you dressed like that.
Oh great, I even get the frumpy Angel of Death.
Would it make a difference if I told you I was voting for Hillary?
I took care of it when he said he was voting for Trump.
You're late. He died yesterday
I wouldn't be caught dead wearing sweatpants in public.
I know what I said but I really didn't think Trump had a chance.
What is this, Casual Die-Day?
You don't have to take it to this level, George. Just don't vote for him.
You'll have to come back later. My husband's still at work.
We're Democrats.
You're here for the cable box aren't you?
Your online dating profile is all lies. But since you’re already here…
I didn't know you guys had 'casual Fridays'
Oh, honey. Not another farm to table restaurant.
Come back in the evening when my husband is home.
There's no bell that tolls, it's a buzzer.
When you're done collecting Harold can you weed-out the flowerbed out front?
Can we make this quick? I've got book club coming over and I didn't read this one.
I don't care if it is your day off, it's time for Mother to go.
You forgot the milk.
Couldn't find a clown costume, huh?
Back in my day these things were a bit more formal.
I already told the other one, I'm voting for Hillary.
Really? Death Dude?
Your timing is bad. We're still doing the creepy clown thing around here.
Did you say rapper or reaper?
Relax, I already voted for Trump.
No need, sir. My husband's been motionless in front of the TV for three weeks. So I assume he's dead.
I don't care if it's "Casual Friday", I'm not going to be caught dead with anyone dressed like that!
Oh, so now it's Casual Friday the 13th?
It wouldn't kill you to dress up once in a while.
I'm not going anywhere with you until you put on some nicer clothes.
You're early. The election is not until November 8th.
Thanks for offering, but my husband bought himself a riding mower.
He's out shopping for a casket.
Wipe your feet first!
Trim the shrubs - make our yard great again.
My moment of fate and you're in sweats? I don't think so.
You are not taking me dressed like that.
Greetings! My husband is in the back bedroom
You're early. Aren't there still a few weeks until Election Day?
I'm sorry, he's not well.
No, we ordered pizza
Grab him by the pussy before you finish him off.
I wasn't expecting Robert Redford but I thought you'd at least try to fix yourself up a bit.
Whatever.
You can forget about a tip with that attitude.
My answers still no, I will not be voting for Trump!
What do you mean, coming home looking like death warmed over?
Well Bill Belichick, as I live and breath.
And I was afraid I'd be underdressed.
You're late. He died an hour ago.
Trick or Trump ?
Casual die-day?
I look grim?! Look who’s talking!
I hear you made a killing in the market today.
Sneakers and a hoodie. My blender is scarier than you,
Since when has this become a casual event?
You don't look anything like your Tinder profile.
Oh, good. It's your day off.
'You're not taking me out dressed like that.'
If Trump had been elected you wouldn't even still be in this country!
They were all out of clown costumes.
Would it kill you to remember the milk?
I hope this pays better than delivering pizza.
You must be the Death of business casual.
I imagine all the other horsemen's kids are wearing hoodies too?
If I find out you were doing anything besides killing people tonight, you'll be in hot water, Mister.
You have the wrong door. I support Hillary.
But i was just about to get to 10,000 steps today.
Try the guy next door. He's your target market.
I take it Hell has frozen over.
He's in the back, sowing.
He's upstairs greasing his skis.
Trick.
You looked far different in your profile picture, mister.
Sorry, we're Democrats.
You're early. He hasn't started his dinner yet.
I said we'd Skype, not scythe.
What took you so long?
I don't think you look so grim.
And what are you supposed to be?
I'm going to need you to take off your shoes first.
Can I offer you my husband instead?
Not until you clean up your room, and that's final!
They're in the bedroom on the right.
Oh, no, I'm sure ol' Bert would love to climb off the couch and go for a jog.
You don't know how relieved I am that I don't have to vote in the Presidential election!
So when did hell freeze over?
I guess millennials have to take what they can get in this economy.
You're premature, we've got Obamacare
You're late....Harold's been dead 10 years.
You know you're in Florida, right?
Well, you don't look like your Tinder photo.
Why can't you spend hours playing mindless video games like the rest of your friends.
If your Dad catches you messing around with his work tools, he's going to kill you.
Let me get my purse.
You have Casual Friday there, too, huh?
Really? This is who Comcast sends to respond to my complaint?
Great, I get to die on casual Friday.....
I don't care if it's from Kanye's fall line, go change.
I grew up on a farm. Let me show you how to use that.
Sorry, I prefer to sow today.
You're too late; he already left for Canada.
Sorry, false alarm. Hillary is back up in the polls.
I thought we were going as Scooby-Doo characters.
Casual Friday? So much for dying with dignity.
Come back when it's not Casual Friday!
I was previously undecided but you're very convincing.
'Death, be not casually dressed'
He's on the couch.
Is it November 8th already?
Seriously? Running shoes?
He's out. Maybe you can text him?
You don't want candy?
Nikes, huh? Okay, just do it.
No, there's no one here named Republican Party.
Can we postpone until November 9th?
Puff Deady?
Not right now, it's just a hernia.
Let me guess: it's casual Friday.
I just mailed his last insurance payment yesterday. Do you think you could wait a few days
You'll wipe your feet if you know what's good for you.
You're early!
Only in Florida
I'm going with trick.
Oy, I just put a roast in the oven.
I'm your Life Coach.
You couldn't call your mother to tell her you would be late?
Aw, come on. It will just take a minute to sew on some long floppy ears.
The CDs are already open, but you can to do the DVDs & Blu-rays.
Can't you just play football like a normal kid?
'Make all the threats you want Mr. Trump. I'm still with her.'
Had to be on casual Friday didn't it?
You're early, come back November 8th
Seriously, Mr. Death? All white AND casual after Labor Day?
This is going to be a casual death.
It's bad enough that you are here to tell me I'm dead, but do you have to rub it in that I didn't exercise enough!
Can I bring a carry-on bag?
No thanks. Just clean the snow off of the driveway and sidewalk.
Double check your calendar, pal. My palm reader says your not due here for another 20 years.
Uh-oh, I knew swiping with reckless abandon was not a good idea.
You're not going out reaping dressed like that, I hope.
How can I take death seriously when you show up here in a white tracksuit
Yes, we have a date, but you are a few decades early.
Huh, looked different on Tinder.
No,no. That was last year, this year it's clowns.
You're going to scare the neighbors to death with that hoodie on.
Playing devil's advocate again?
You're too early. America hasn't voted yet.
I'd rather die than go jogging.
Have a good time with your friends, don't stay out too late, and try not to be so grim.
Are you going to do our lawn with that thing? Over my dead body!
Don't give me that death stare young man, you're late!
If you're supposed to be Death, then I'm Mary Poppins!
You forgot your keys again, didn't you?
Face it, Jimmy. You are neither grim, nor a reaper.
I told you to get a life, not a scythe
I know you came as fast as you could, but he got impatient and took the window.
Now don’t try to tell me you’ve finished harvesting all those souls already!
He's in the bedroom.
We are offering organic weed control.
No, I said bring over some reefer, Jim.
No. You are not going to work at home today.
I don't care if your black robe is at the dry cleaners, you look ridiculous.
Let me guess: Casual Die Day?
You've got the wrong address. The RNC is right across the street.
How 'bout some candy corn, a Snickers bar...and my mother-in-law?
I need to shave my legs first.
Yeh, well, dad's on vacation so I'm filling in
I called for the Exterminator.
He's not here but you're welcome to come in and wait."
I'm so glad you're here. My husband's about to bore me to death anyway."
Let me guess . . . your phone died.
Not until you show me what's in your pocket.
I hope you're related to the Reapers that live across the street.
It's hard to take you seriously on dress-down Friday's.
I don't participate in Casual Friday the Thirteenth.
In my opinion you approach your job too casually.
I ordered gothic-tragic, not hip hop-casual.
I hope you're the real thing, because I'm out of Halloween treats.
You have casual Fridays too?
Is this your idea of a knock-knock joke?
Shoes off. House rules.
You'll find him in his bedroom wasting his life tweeting about some dumb teenage thing.
Get a job, Dave.
Well, it may be casual to you but not to me!
I'll tell him you're here, but he won't like that you're out of uniform.
I forgot it's casual Friday. Do I have time to put on yoga pants?
Did my ex-husband send you?
Even in death, I don't get the respect I deserve!
You are taking a big risk by knocking on doors in this neighborhood while wearing a hoodie.
How can you be so casual at a time like this?
You're early. My husband's not home yet!
Thank god you're here. He's watching football.
Wipe your feet before you come in.
This can't be. I'm pro-life!
He's not home right now, but please come back at 5:30.
He's out playing golf. Please come back at 5.
You couldn't 've come before the election?
It's hard to take you seriously in a hoodie.
I'll check. If he's drunk, you can have him.
In fact I HAVE heard the good news, thanks you very much.
As you can see, GPS tracking is NOT one hundred percent accurate.
Hi Donald.
I don't care if it's Saturday, you should still dress appropriately for work.
Why so grim? Both presidential candidates are here.
He's in the basement playing Halo 5.
I can sew whatever you reap.
Is this what I get for dying on a Friday?
Well if you want to come in, you'll have to take off those dirty shoes.
Sheesh, you look like death.
Is this about Larry's six strikeouts in the company softball game?
No, no, someone got the order wrong. I asked to TERMINATE DELIVERY, not deliver termination.
I wish you'd said something before I went to the store.
The casual look isn't fooling anyone, Mister.
We already have a kid that does the lawn.
Did someone order a slice?
Late as usual.
That's what you wear to take a lady out?
He's not quite ready yet. I'm still working on it.
Did you edge along the sidewalk?
I'm not going out with you dressed like that.
Late again, your killing me.
Wow, you really *aren't* proud!
Previous guy used a mower.
Sorry - he left earlier this morning on a hunting trip.
Oh please. My son uses that laundry day excuse all the time.
You're here for my husband? come back at 5:30.
I hate the graveyard shift
If you think I'm coming with you dressed like that ...
For the last time Billy, I'm not paying you to cut the grass unless you use a mower or lose the hoodie.
I'd like to add you to my professional network on LinkedIn.
Thanks, but we hired a lawn service this year.
Feeling a little Grimm today are we?
Off to the gym, reaper?
I thought you said moving back home was the bad news?
You're going to have to wait a minute,I'm baking some cookies that are to die for.
You're the fifth Donald Trump I've seen tonight.
Whew! For a second I thought you might be a salesman!
Is that a gun in your pocket?
Why don't you start with the weeds in the back yard?
Yes, I'm Mrs. Reed. But I hired a weed whacker, not a Reed whacker.
This grim rapper thing of yours is not working!
Over my dead body will I go out with YOU again!
He'll be home at 7.
Just for the record, I hope you're here for the Mr.
Dad's in the den.
Well, I don't fear the sneakers either.
Tell me you're the death of casual Fridays.
3A is down the hall to your left.
You need a shovel for snow, dummy.
Are you coming for my husband or are the weeds too high in the back yard
You have a problem with MY match.com photo?!!
Well, at least you have a job.
Well, aren't you just the last thing I expected.
Would this have something to do with the Cubs and the World Series?
YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT WHILE I GET MY HAIR DONE.
You're here for my soul? You're gonna have to do better than that if you want some candy.
You may be grim, but I am deplorable.
Grim Reaper or Grim Rapper
Well thanks, I guess, for the save-the-date.
I'm telling you Mom, it's not a phase.
You're late. I changed my mind.
I'm your UberAfterlife driver.
You looked way more lively in your profile picture.
You look like Death warmed over!
Come back later when my husband is home.
Wait right here. The list is in the kitchen.
Ok, let me go get my bag of candy. You wait right here!
Well, at least I don't have to look like this anymore...
I guess white is the new black!
Timmy's not allowed to play with you anymore.
I know the election looks grim, but the GOP Really needs a new mascot
In a post election feminist world: "If you're here to grab my pussy, you're going to need a much larger weapon."
Death, be like, totally not proud.
What's your candidate's position on the death penalty?
Just do it.
You had to come during 'Dancing with the Stars'!
Wow. Does every job have casual Fridays now?
he's up stairs.
Come back at half-time.
I don't care why you are here, please remove your shoes!
Dressed to chill.
You think that's scary? Have you been paying attention to the election?
I don't think the younger look is going to have any effect on repeat-business.
And here I was thinking I had stretched the truth in my online dating profile.
You've got the wrong address. The Republican Party doesn't live here.
I'm knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door.
He's out back digging a six foot deep hole.
Is this because of the cigarettes?
It's a good thing I voted early this year.
So who are you supposed to be? The Grim Sneaker?
I'm not going anywhere with you dressed like that.
Well, look who's Mr. Fashionista!
actually, now i'm not sure how many people live here.
I might have known you'd come for me on casual Friday!
Just my luck to kick the bucket on Casual Friday.
But it was only a parking ticket!
No, I will not consider voting for Donald Trump in the upcoming election.
Please tell me you're selling cookies.
So far I'm not impressed.
Well, it's certainly an improvement over that clown costume !
You didn't look so deathly on your Tinder profile...
You're too late; the other certain thing got him and he'll be out in 3-5 years.
Where have you been young man? I've been worried to death!
We gave already.
Hmph. Death be not Prada.
Really? I'm going to going to die on a casual Friday?
We're all out of candy
You are too late.We harvested our wheat last week,but if you want to take a whack at the weeds along the fence line,that would be cool.
I wouldn't be caught dead with someone dressed like you.
Would you like to speak with the man of the house?
So it's casual Friday?
I know the election will be over in a few weeks. Please just take me now.
Hey Marty, someone's at the door for you.
The hoodie greatly diminishes your grimness quotient
I knew I should've swiped left.
This is exactly why I voted early.
Wrong door. You want the fat jogger in 314.
Well I guess you could cut the weeds in back.
No matter what you say, Hillary has my vote.
Fine! But can I have a few more days to see the first woman be elected president?
May I offer some advice on how your weeding service business might pick up here in our retirement community?
I hope you are the 'Grim Rapper'
I don't care if you are the Grim Reaper, you're not goofing off all week. Go out to the garden and reap me some tomatoes for dinner.
Thank you kindly, but I am not interested. The front yard could use a good scything though, how much?
Please come in. I've been dying to meet you.
gosh, tonite he's with his mistress. you around next week?
Well, if you had Facebook like a normal human being, you'd know she's enjoying the lobster risotto at that new place in SoHo right now.
The Trump campaign is expecting you.
Well, well, well, look who finally decided to put down the remote and pay me a visit...
Well, I'm the Prim Reaper
Let me guess: death takes a holiday and hipsters fill in.
That's strange! I thought you'd be taller.
So you're saying people are taking death more casually these days?
You must be the Reaper boy from next door. Beelzebub isn't home right now.
But surely not on your day off.
You sure don't look like your photo on OK Cupid.
Yeah, I'm the one who called. We've got a bad infestation of houseguests in the dining room.
Yeah I had the meat lovers pizza with nacho cheese stuffed crust
'Mr. Healthy' left five minutes ago, headed south
Well, my goodness, you're not nearly as grim as I thought you'd be.
Your father and I are still waiting for you to make a killing on Wall Street.
It's time for you to get your own life.
Well, you're certainly dressed for it. He's in on the couch watching television.
Trim my hedges, your ass.
You must have the wrong address. I'm expecting a pizza.
Sorry, we don't accept death casually in this household.
YOU CALL THAT GRIM!!!!?
You dressed down, for this?
My husband's not home yet. Did you want to wait?
Careful... you'll put your eye out with that thing.
He's not here right now. Can you come back in an hour?
Sure , my husband can play Hockey with you.
What a relief. I thought you were going to go as a clown.
Not in that outfit
Nice try Jim, but I'm still not going jogging with you.
Come back after I've voted.
You can order anything on Amazon these days
Sorry, we use a mower.
It is a grim election, but you're overdoing it.
This was your fantasy, not mine.
Sorry you missed him. He died last week.
Come on in and have a drink. My husband will be home soon.
We've all just been dying for you to get here.
Business casual?
I'll let him know your here
Okay. But first, can you unclog my sink? It's driving me nuts.
Hey, watch out with that, you'll put your eye out... oh, never mind...
I think I'll pass.
Well, you certainly ensure that there is no dignity in death, don't you?
Bob, there's a Mr. Reaper here to see you.
One more step and I can legally shoot you.
My husband has been dying to meet you.
They let you on the subway with that thing?
He usually gets home about seven. Be sure to stop back then
It was a stupid paper cut.
Yes, even Death has to take off his shoes before entering the condo.
My ex is dying to meet you.
No thanks -- I buy all my scythes on Amazon this days.
Are you one of those deplorable people?
'seriously?!....casual Friday?'
I told SIRI " a Housekeeper"!
It's your summer job, Sam, just fix the mower.
Call me when you're ready for something serious.
A hoodie? Really?
You call 'that' business casual?
Pheww, for a second I thought that it was going to be another one of those missionaries.
ALL Lives Matter!
No, You have the wrong address. His campaign headquarters are two doors down.
My profile said that I like to cycle, not sickle!
My husband is in the back room.
NO, I WILL NOT VOTE FOR TRUMP
Nice try. But it's the Cub's year.
First, mind helping me move some boxes?
No, I'm not going to give you my tax records.
Casual Friday is getting out of hand.
Just you wait until your father gets home!
After the election.
Junior, I said Skype me.
He'll be home in an hour.
So. What am I supposed to do. Drop down dead?
Is this more of a casual suggestion or is this fate?
Is it really November 8th already?
Spell 'scythe' and you can come in.
You guys don't listen very well. I asked for a sweeper, a chimney sweeper.
Friday or not, I would have appreciated a bit more formality.
Sup.....
Somehow 'Like, whatever, it's your time' doesn't exactly concentrate my mind.
We already have a lawn service.
Are you here to kill Facebook finally?
Come back on November 8th, I'll let you know if I need you.
Not. Interested.
Yes, we plan to vote. Thanks for the reminder.
I feel oddly compelled to choose the two-year subscription to "Life."
I'll vote for who ever the hell I want to!
He's in the living room, but he died a long time ago
The grunge reaper?
You're late! The GOP has been expecting you!
I was expecting the Great Pumpkin. Who the *#%& are you?!
Your profile didn't mention the scythe.
Who shall I say is calling?
If I wanted a sloppy death, I would have jumped off a bridge.
So it ends in sweats and plaid and sensible shoes. Or are you here to fix the toilet?
Would you believe I gave at the office?
Fine, I can stop obsessing about the election.
Okay, but just one drink.
What is this, Casual Death Friday?
Your late. He died last week.
Charon said he'll meet you at the gym.
Casual Friday? Seriously?
Really? On a Friday?
You still need to be back by 10.
Well I must say, this is not much of a last impression to make.
Come on in. He's in is man cave watching football.
There must be some mistake, I swiped left.
You just missed him; try him at the office.
Hold on a second, I'll get him for you.
Wrong house! I unendorsed him weeks ago!
He's at the pub with your dad.
Oh, I get it. Casualty Friday. Cute.
The Presidential Debates sucked all the life out of me, there is nothing left for you to take.
I shan’t be collected by an intern.
What are you...the HIP Reaper? Sweatpants?... Seriously?
Let me guess. You're running for president.
YOU'RE DEATH? I thought you were the new landscaper!
Well, I'm very happy to hear you that you finally found a job, Danny, but I'm afraid I can't let you bring your work home.
Would you like to come in for a cold one?
I guess when I asked for a man to come into my life I should've been more specific.
You were supposed to be home two hours ago and don't tell me you were just killing time!
You're killing me with those sweats!
Didn't you see the sign!? It says "No Soliciting"!
Good Harvest?
This casual Friday thing has gotten way, way out of hand.
Sure, he's out back.
You can wait or come back when his Medicare runs out.
Sorry, I took a baby aspirin, maybe nextime.....
I refuse to die on casual Friday.
Chubby, balding red-headed man in his late fifties in the corner booth with a chipped front tooth and a pinky ring . I'd hate for you to take the wrong person.
I at least thought my death would be a business-casual event.
I'm still undecided. Please take me now.
Oh darn, he's out. Can you come back in an hour?
I guess I didn't realize the afterlife had Casual Friday.
At least take your shoes off.
No, I'm the slovenly reaper. Some of the work gets farmed out.
Yes, I am certain that we only need our weeds whacked.
The Grim-Hoodie, I presume?
You'd get a better response if you weren't wearing that hoodie.
He' playing golf today but he says any time before the election is fine
You can threaten me all you want, Mr. Zuckerberg. I'm not signing up for Facebook.
So, I haven't been to the gym! You don't have to chop my head off about it!
We're doing casualty Fridays.
I'm a registered Independent. Why?
No, Apt. 204 is across the hall, but be sure to come back November 8th.
Nobody wears white after Labor Day.
You're here to cut and run, aren't you?
Thank god, I was hoping you'd come before the election.
Did you even read the sign? It says NO solicitors.
I thought tonight was a black scythe affair.
He's in the basement playing video games. Good luck.
Couldn't we at least have dinner first?
That is not concealed carry.
Cigarettes? All I have is candy.
This should be interesting, my last date died of boredom.
Your profile did say you were into The Dead.
Why the long scythe?
Can you wait until the sixth of November?
Take your hand out of your pocket.
I wouldn't be caught dead on a date with someone dressed like that!
The grass looks fine, but this month go easier on the hedges.
I don't care what Ben Franklin said. I pay enough in taxes to avoid you for now.
If you're looking for the Trump campaign, it's down the hall.
Casual Friday really isn't working for you.
Come back when I've finished paying off my student loans.
Well, I guess I won't be getting that pizza I ordered.
You're going door to door for the GOP, you say?
I see it's Casual Friday in the afterlife.
Well, Junior, I'm glad you found an internship. But don't expect the members of this household to help you reach your monthly quota!
I'm sorry. I'm just the house sitter. The home owner won't be back 'til Thursday.
Not now. I just cleaned the place.
You're too early. Come back later.
That job of yours must be absolute murder.
You might be giving people the wrong impression.
I know it's quiet, but I still prefer my string trimmer.
You must be here for America's dignity.
You're too late. The Fitbit already got him.
Yes, our relationship is dead, but you don't have to dress the part!
You're Dead to me.
You're somewhat scary, but at least you're not a creepy clown.
"I know that's you, Frank! I wish you would stop going into "Reaper-mode" every time my mother coughs!
You're too late. I already voted Libertarian.
Since it seems taxes aren't certain, I'm not convinced you are.
I was terrified until I noticed your grim Reebok's.
I'm not going out with you looking like that!
You got the call saying I'd be here between 48 and 53?
Reaper...maybe. Grim, not in the least.
How's the cold Agnes, you look like death"
No. I ordered a large pizza with pepperoni,
Finally.... I've been dying to see you!
Yeah, well I'll come for YOU if you aren't back by 10!
So it's casual Friday is it?
Just make it quick.
Well you're not exactly a snazzy dresser, but you sure do know how to accessorize.
I guess we could use a little help with the harvest.
But I just signed a ten year lease!
Can you wait a minute while I finish The New Yorker magazine cartoon caption contest?
Happy Halloween to my first trick-or-treater I hope.
So casual Friday did die.
Frankly, you look more Slacker then Reaper.
Are you taking me to my eternal lounging place?
Who buzzed you up?
What is this -- 'Casual Black Friday'?
Ever hear of a lawn mower?
You can start with my husband in the basement.
No, no, I ordered a Weed Whacker!
You really should update your profile picture.
I really don't see a future for us.
The room's already been rented.
She's in 105 now, down the hall and to the right.
Give me a minute to fix my face.
Laundry day?
And what exactly are you supposed to be, the Grim Hipster?
Election Day 2016 finally arrives.
Tree pruning?
I don't care. I am NOT voting for Hillary!
The younger look doesn't really suit you.
Either you say ‘Trick or Treat’ or I slam this door in your face.
Ugh, millennials.
I knew it. Exercise will be the death of me.
Don't miss any dandelions.
You're too late, he died last week.
You're late—Frank's been dead since he lost the remote.
You just missed him. He went for a drink with the other doomed souls on the block.
Uber "joint venture" or not, I'm not going with you.
I don't care why you're here. I need to see some I.D. first.
Hmm. In the black robe you looked thinner.
Could you at least put a little effort into looking grim?
Reaper, smeaper. You're still not coming in with those shoes.
You're late, but at least you arrived before Nov. 8th.
You're home late for dinner. We're having filet of soul.
Sow what?
Grandpa's here, but he's not feeling well.
hello, mam...we are offering assisted suicide services in the area...
Life Harvest Fund, I've never heard about it. Can you tell me more?
I knew jogging would kill me.
This is not a neighborhood where you want to go around in a hoodie.
You're NOT from the lawn service?
Come on in. I'll get the chess board.
So it's casual Friday for you too?
Have a good day at work, dear.
You're late, just like my husband.
Death should still call, when he knows he'll be late.
Do you also mow lawns?
Just my luck. And on casual Friday, too.
OK, but I haven't gone running in years.
You shouldn't be walking around with your hoodie up.
This is serious business, take your hand out of your pocket and get some  proper shoes.
The RNC office is across the street.
I see that you have casual Fridays, too.
No, the Trump campaign is next door.
Ah yes. My husband was expecting you.
Lose the scythe! The hoody's scary enough.
City Water Inspector? Sounds reasonable, come on in.
More like the Slim Creeper, I'd say.
Why don't you comeback this evening when my husband is home.
Well, in that case, come back after 6 o'clock when my husband is home
No, I am NOT interested in voting for Donald Trump.
I still think you should have taken the pizza delivery gig.
Really, Reaper? A hoodie and sneakers? Doesn't anybody dress for success these days?
The Joneses are down the hall, next door on the right.
I don't care if it is casual Friday it just doesn't seem right
That hoodie makes you look threatening.
I'm just here to water the plants. Try again tomorrow.
Is today your laundry day?
Friday?!? You couldn't wait until Monday?!?
It shatters my heart all over again to say this, but I think you're looking for my ex-husband.
Phil will be right out. He's putting on his casual Friday outfit, too.
Yes I said it was a poor grass cutting job but let's not lose our heads about it.
You'll have to come back when he's done with his nap
Bob would like to reschedule your appointment.
Yo, right back at you.
Come off it, Stanley. You were always grim but never a reaper.
If you ask me, this Casual Friday thing has gone too far.
Casual Friday, I see.
What does it say that you're the first black person I've seen in a New Yorker cartoon?
Do you have any idea whose time it is, mister?
"You're not 'going to make America great again' looking like that".
I knew Tinder would be the death of me.
He's down at The Cask and Flagon. I told him he'd pay big-time for going out tonight.
"I don't care if it took 5 hours. You still only get 10 dollars".
You've no bag and I've no candy. So we're even.
There were no casual Fridays when they came for nana.
No, you want 3B.
Hey, I didn't buzz you up.
Is there no respect for tradition anymore?
Do go gentle into that good night, because you're not coming back home to live.
If you're here for the desktop, it's already dead.
The Grim Reaper huh. Are you working for Trump?
The only thing you are Harry is a grim idiot.
With all due respect Mr. Belichick, the NFL dropped the "sudden death" format years ago.
Yo! Mister Slacker Reaper, I'm Kelly Arnold not Arnold Kelly.
Sorry, I've already registered to vote.
Sweatpants? Really?
Grim Gardening Services, you reap what we sow
This is my new relaxed look. We didn't want to scare people to death.
Are you really going to wear sweats to work?
Swipe left.
You call that cutting edge technology?
Great, death's gone millennial. Now I suppose you want to praised for finding me.
The GOP isn't home.
What part of "I will survive" don't you get?
Who in the hell are you?
Stop slouching, young man.
In this house we take off our shoes.
Can you wait until November 9? There's something very important I need to do.
'Killing Me Softly' is just a song...OKAY?!?
Let me guess - you're campaigning for Donald Trump?
Sorry, but there are no middle aged females here.
He's upstairs. Have a seat and I'll get him right away.
It's just, this is kind of a big day for me.
Coffee, tea, me?
Finally. A presidential candidate that I can vote for...
But I ordered pizza.
You look just like your profile picture.
Hmm. I always pictured you as being taller and thinner.
Next time, call first.
What! I'm not good enough for the original Death?
You can forget the pitch. I already voted by mail for your boss.
I think you have the wrong apartment. The GOP lives down the hall.
Cartoon lives matter.
This is the date I've been waiting for all my life and you dress like that?
Where in Hell have you been? The lawn died weeks ago!
Excuse me. Is this the Rebulican National Committee headquarters?
Where's the pizza I ordered?
Harold if you don't like visiting my mom, you can just say so.
Finally...Trump has a ground game.
What the hell? I signed up for senior dating expecting somebody a little bit more lively.
Well come in before you catch your death of cold.
I see they told you I'm a runner.
And which campaign are YOU from?
Still taking reservations for November?
Well, let me change into something more comfortable.
Could you just email me?
She's not in.
No, I'm not voting for Trump.
You looked much younger in your Match.com photo.
Fred, your dress up jokes are killing me.
this is not what I envisioned when you said you're a cross dresser.
Thanks for coming. Maybe you can get through to her.
Leave the wheat. Kill the chaff.
You really don't look that grim to me.
Can I wait until election day and then decide?
Overkill.
No, Johnny can't come out to play.
Come back after 6, my husband should be home by then.
You're late. You had me worried to death!
I think you have the wrong address
Sorry, I'm out of candy.
You look like hell, I'm not going anywhere with you dressed like that!
If you think I'm going to jump right to the bargaining phase . . .
Jeez Bill, you look like Death! You're late.
Sorry he just took off jogging. You should be able to catch up to him.
I want classic grim reaper, not casual Friday reaper.
As long as there's no rough stuff
What other credentials do you have?
Wait, don’t tell me…an alienated teenager.
I'm not going to the afterlife with you dressed like that.
I thought he was with you.
No, I ordered a carpet sweeper.
So THIS is how you're paying off your student loans.
You're not fooling anyone with the sweatpants and sneakers, mister.
I'm dying to know when you started a casual Friday policy.
Your manager said you would be here between noon and 4. You'll have to come back another day.
Well, no surprise you didn't get the job, Harold. Look at those shoes!
My candy or my life??!! Is that the best you could do?
Turns out I just needed to shut it down and start it up again.
Sorry, the harvest is done. Do you cut hair?
Well then I get to put on flats.
I'm sorry but there are no millenials here.
'He's not in. Try the golf course."
Don’t you think that uniform’s a bit too dramatic for a rodent exterminator?
Thanks, but I downloaded your app and just took care if it myself.
No offense, Death, but you don't look much like your profile picture...
I always knew I was drop dead gorgeous.
Young man, you get back in here and change before you kill another living thing!
You know you can't wear white after Labor Day!
I see you're going through a mid-death crisis.
Aren't you a little old to be trick-or-treating?
Was the store all out of clown costumes?
Thanks, but I've already had my wheat and chaff separated.
Come back when you get a lawnmower.
It's after labor day and you're still wearing white, but I'm the one being sentenced to death?
No, I'm not dressing up for the Ingmar Bergman film festival.
What's this, death casual?
Maybe a selfie first?
I told you I have found someone else to cut the grass.
He's not here. Try Rumsfeld's office.
I didn't come all the way downstairs to be at death's door, now watcha want.
I guess they'll call this a casual killing.
He says he uninstalled the iDead app months ago.
Can you come back next week? I just bought green bananas.
No, I don't have any grim to reap. Beat it!
No, the Donald Trump headquarters are next door.
At least you're not those mormon missionaries knocking on my door again.
I said, shovel the snow
So, can we count on your vote on Election Day?
So death can't even do business casual?
You're too late. He took a job in the Styx.
It's casual die-day.
Casual Friday ma'am
Hey, take it easy! I SAID I'd turn my music down.
You are not wearing that to vote.
Just give me a few moments to look up your ratings on Yelp.
You look like death warmed up!
Your black robe is at the dry cleaners?
I'm sorry, but you missed him by about ten minutes.
Maybe you shouldn't be so casual about death.
Your shoe's untied
How have you not been shot yet?
I don't care who your father is, you cannot date my daughter!
Oh, so nice of you to come on your day off!
Oh, okay but before you do, I've always wondered how to pronounce that thing.
No, you can't have your old room back.
Geez, Bobby. You almost gave me a heart attack.
Don't make a mess of it. Unless you want only one star on yelp.
You have great timing - it's election night.
You must be the death dude.
They said you would be here in 30 minutes or less.
Terminix?
I called for a babysitter, not a baby scyther.
You look how I feel!
Please tell me you're the tax collector!
so you are like "uber for death" you say?
I'm not one to profile. But you should know that the hoodie is scaring people.
This could be the death of Casual Fridays.
Jeez, it took you an eternity to show up.
You seemed taller in the photos.
Can you come back later, I'm doing my kegel exercises?
You took an Uber?
Street style wrecks your credibility.
Is Donald home?
Some people have a weird idea of how to make hay.
And which candidate are you collecting for?
'No, I don't want him back!"
We didn't call an exterminator.
Hang on a second. I'll go get him.
What, you couldn't dress for the occasion?
You've been replaced by a clown.
What happened to your lawnmower?
You first.
So, orange is the new black?
I suppose we're taking an Uber?
We broke up. I threw out the sharpener with the rest of your stuff.
How was practice,honey?
Always reaping, never sowing, as usual I see.
You're late
SKYPE. I said SKYPE me.
May I have just five minutes with him first?
Well you don't look anything like your profile pic, but you are punctual.
A grim reaper with crocs?
Our order was for chicken fajitas.
It's Halloween, so I'm not buyin' it.
Sorry to bother you. I think you may have picked up my dry cleaning by mistake: Black cloak, wool, full-length, nice affair.
He's in the bedroom. Try not to ruin the sheets. And you're late. Again.
So, coaching the Patriots is just your day job?
I expected you AFTER the election.
What was wrong with the puffy tail and the bunny ears?
Please tell me you're selling artisanal lawn care services.
When I told you to get a costume that kills, this is not what I had in mind.
Yeah, now you show up. Where were you before the election?
Sorry, I specifically requested a pest exterminator.
You're a sight for sore eyes this election season.
Honey, I'm not in the mood.
If taxes didn't work with him I don't think this will either.
No, we're legally separated... but you can find him over at 10 Lover's Lane 2nd floor rear left apartment if you hurry."
Thank goodness you're here. The weeds out back are out of control.
You, too, with the Casual Fridays?
"Unlimited data for life?" No thanks!
Yeah, well I'm the allowance reaper.
Bernie lost--get over it.
Do you have ID?
Ah, I think you have the wrong home, the address you seek is 725 5th Ave.
I'm sorry. I'm a registered Democrat. You want the guy in 406.
We don't want any.
You’re too old, it’s not Halloween and I haven’t got any candy. Beat it.
Be careful where you wear that hoodie.
I told you last week that my twin sister is off studying fruit flies in the Sahara.
I've been dead for years so just run along now.
You didn't knock.
So who are you?... the Angel of Def.
For Pete's sake, Karl, I said 'pick me up a SLICE.'
I refuse to go to the afterlife on Casual Friday!
you're awful casual about this date
Sorry, we have a regular gardener
You think you can fool me? You're Mark Zuckerberg.
Nobody's going to be afraid of death, if you go to work looking like that!
No, the grass doesn't need cutting.
Funny, but he says he doesn't feel like jogging today.
Oh nuts! I thought you were the Amazon delivery guy.
" So, you say you are not a salesman, yet you are making me pay the ultimate price?
You,re not grim and you're late.
I believe this casual Friday business has gone way too far.
I was told there were no death panels.
In presenting yourself, you should take example from those nice Mormon young men.
what took you so long he died three weeks ago
"Unfortunately, my husband's not home right now"!
You ain't grim enough to reap this soul.
Casual Friday in the afterlife?! Who knew?!
I can't believe they're making you work on your day off.
He moved to 324 Lake St. Tap the motif of Beethoven's Fifth and he'll open for sure.
Grim??? Seriously???
No,no, you misunderstood, I said my pumpkin pie is something to die for.
The white is an improvement, but you still look too grim.
Well it's about time. He's at the podium now.
You're late. Dinner's cold.
Well, you're early.
I don’t care how good a letter opener it is. I’m not interested.
Nice try, Arthur. We're not going to Burning Man.
So, which candidate are you supposed to be?
Yeah, right.
Well, speak up! I haven't got all day, you know!
I saw your ad on Craigslist. Where's the body?
Oh. You're looking for my husband. He's in the study with one of his interns.
Makes sense. And how is climate change affecting heaven?
Thanks, but I've already registered to vote.
Old school, huh? The other boy that used to cut my lawn had a gas mower.
I'm gonna kill my sister for setting up this blind date.
Any chance you got the wrong address?
You just missed him. Maybe come back around 3 this afternoon?
What took you so long?! He's in the garage.
Hello, my name is Jimmy. I wanted to have 10 minutes of your time to speak to you about Jesus Christ, and the after life.
No thanks, I'm with her.
How did you find me? On the Internet, I'm a 15 year old hacker from Uzbekistan.
You're too late. We already voted.
I said get popsicles on your way home.
About time. My will to live died YEARS ago!
I suspect there's been more rapping than reaping this evening.
Sorry, but we already have lawn care.
I didn't order soul food, I ordered Chinese.
We gave last year!
No, the hoodie doesn't make you scarier.
I already told you, I'm a Hillary supporter.
The Republicans are meeting next door
Hoodie scary, scythe not so much.
alive lives matter?
I'm sorry; nobody by that name lives here!
I know you are, Dear, but I still want you in by eleven.
Whatever you're selling, I don't want any. By the way fella, you look like death warmed over.
$20 for the front and the back. Looks like you'll need a rake.
Oh for....just once; I thought I might go out with a classy guy.
Sorry - he and his kids just left for Mar-a-Lago. Can I text him for you?
I was hoping for a creepy clown.
No, my name is Lizzie GORDON and both my parents live in Miami Beach
Your father never left a client in purgatory to go skateboarding with the guys.
And what if I don't want my lawn mowed?
Welcome to Donald Trump's America.
So, what you really meant your online profile to say was "zest for THE living?"
Susie?...I think she lives next door.
You looked taller in your profile picture.
No, Ralph's not home. Should I check our insurance coverage?
I'm not buying your knives.
You look different than your picture online.
Does your father know you have his scythe?
Took you long enough!
It's another Trump canvasser.
Seriously, Casual Friday for the Grim Reaper?
No, I don't know anyone named Shaggy and Scooby doo.
All the treats are gone. For the life of me, I'm afraid to ask what your trick might be.
But I just bought a groupon for a massage.
He's at the Jets game.
Sorry, I'm Buddhist.
Where the Hell have you been?!
I don't care if it is casual Friday; I'm not going anywhere with a demon dressed in a hoodie and sweatpants.
Really Tommy? First the clowns now this?
Oh hey...you must be here for my husband.
So Hell has casual fridays now?
That w'd be my nephew. He is upstairs texting.
Come back in 30 years!
Cut the comedy, Harold. Just cut the weeds.
The hoodie's a bit much.
You're two hours late!
You're doing casual fridays too?
I think you’re taking the ‘Death be not proud’ thing a little too far.
Sorry, I cut my own lawn.
You better put down your hoodie, you might get killed afterwards.
Worst Friday ever.
I ordered pizza.
It's a 'health club'. I told you they wouldn't let you in with that thing.
Did you check his office?
You're looking for Harry Reid next door.
No thanks. Got one of those. I'm waiting for the brush salesman.
I`d never thought death would come knocking at my door. It's a bit of a downer, really.
Hmmm...but I do have this neighbor....
What kept you?
Is volunteering for Trump rewarding?
COME BACK AT SIX, HE'LL BE HOME BT THEN.
I do indeed think you are early.
You want the campaign down the hall
Are you sure we can't handle this online?
No, I'm voting for Clinton!
First, do everyone a favor and kill that fashion statement!
Well, yes the Cubs are normally ready for you this time of year . . .
Sorry, my husband does the gardening.
So, is grim now passe, or is this just a casual Friday?
I already gave to the Trump campaign.
By the way, I can see your face.
For this I put on stockings?
I liked you better as a clown.
Skype. I said I want to learn to skype.
Identity theft is no joke, young man
Sorry, I am voting for Hillary.
Really, you're going door to door as a "reapest'?
I would scream but my neighbors would kill me.
Howard, I think you're not getting the point of role playing.
Well, the politically incorrect side of me is terrified.
You are late, he's with Trump
Wait here, I need to feed my cats
Must be Casual Friday in The Underworld.
So, you're not getting the riding mower?
Are you flirting with me?
Well, it's about time. This outfit has been asking for it since the 60s.
Oh Leonard, I've told you to cut it out, scythes don't matter.
Well if he wants me to nag him to death...
My mother left this morning.
You appear in one Ingmar Bergman film and one Woody Allen film and so now you think you don't have to dress for dinner?
Business casual will be the death of me.
No, nobody named Sam Sung here.
So, I see death doesn't even have a dress code these days...
You'll work for souls?
Come back later. He's at work right now.
You kill me!You just kill me!
Casual Friday in the nertherworld?
It's about time! I've been calling you since the primary season first started!
Of course. Makes sense. As a high school English teacher I always knew my end would somehow include a snarky teenager. Touché young man, touché.
No, I'm not interested in buying any subscriptions to Dead People magazine.
Sorry, you're in the wrong 'hood. You need to go down two blocks and cross the River Styx.
You're late. The Donald is already gone.
You are early, let me get my pocketbook can we get Chinese food my name is Karen By the way. I don't usually get much of a response on these dating sites are you cold why are the cats hiding......
"I'll give you fifty bucks to cut both the front and back yards".
This is our last date!
So that's your only problem with this... the fact that I'm not wearing a black robe?
Look, I told you, come Wednesday,November 9th!
He's not here right now. Come back tomorrow.
I don't care if the cleaners did lose your robe. I'm not coming.
Through the door it sounded more like 'Jim Greeber'.
And don't come back until you've got Donald Trump!
So what happened, they ran out of Trump costumes already; and Hillary wasn't scary enough?
Aren't you worried the hoodie might set people off?
No, he can't come out and play
He's still in bed. I couldn't wake him up. Could you come back later?
Life got you down?
I'm busy now. Could you come back later?
For a Reaper, you're not that grim.
Well I'm his wife and I say no way he's dying on casual Friday!
Uh, this is a "Stand Your Ground" state you know.
No, Grunge Reaper is NOT a thing.
Hi. Does civil political discourse live here?
Ugh, another iPhone upgrade?
I've come to pick up the couch potato.
Do you have a moment to meet our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ?
So this is what dating on line sends me!
Sorry, this is my husband's night out with the Boys.
Sorry, he has already departed.
Oh, you want to see Grandma? She's right down the...Wait a second...
You look older than your picture.
You do seem more relaxed since you took that holiday.
I should have known. The Bummed Reaper.
Easy, tiger! I haven't gotten this kinky since Grad School...
Sorry, she just moved to Florida...
Oh, it's only you, Death. I was afraid that it was a socialist."
You better take that hoodie off, or people to think you're up to no good.
A bit heavy handed to get me to vote for your candidate!
No thank you, I'm not interested in buying a life insurance policy.
Sorry, George Zimmerman no longer lives here.
Trump campaign headquarters?
But you aren't Mark Zuckerberg, are you...
Johnny can't play Grim Rapper today.
No...I don't want to go running with you!
Are the stars out tonight? I don't care if it's cloudy or bright, because I only have scythes for you!
Well mom you did say I should move out and get a life
This generation is going to kill me
Who are you, Death Takes a Holiday?
Are you sure it's not my husband you're here to see?
You can borrow the cup of sugar but I'm not comfortable with the pound of soul.
I don't care if its Casual Friday; I want some pomp in my passing!
Hell now offers casual Fridays? I'm still not interested.
It's a good thing your father didn't live to see this.
I can see your heart isn't in it.
Wrong address!
My husband has already left for work.
At least give me a moment to call 911. I've got a meat loaf in the oven.
I know that sniffle!
You be careful......wearing that hoodie is dangerous!
Sorry, he's out of town.
Wait until the electoral college results are in.
So, how was your holiday?
Didn't you hear? It's dangerous to wear hoodies in public.
He just left.
No, I don't want to buy your life insurance.
Henry, enough with the carpe diem routines....I'll be ready in two minutes!
I agree with the Co-op Board. You're an undesirable.
Hoodies are so last year.
I'm glad it is you and not a clown.
You don't look very grim to me.
Why on earth are you wearing a hoodie inside? People might think you are up to no good.
Fluffy or Ira?
You're not fooling anyone.
Please tell Donald I don't care. I'm voting for Hillary.
Can you come back after my hair appointment tomorrow?
Jeez Carl, you look like death!
uh...that's what you wore to work today?
Are you the death of pumpkin soy latte?
I've never been so insulted! Come back for me after you've changed into something less 'rapper' and more 'Reaper.'
He's in the bathroom, but coffee's on if you can spare 20 minutes.
I'm sorry, but I'm just not interested in traveling to alternative worlds.
So, my decision to cancel Casual Fridays has come back to haunt me, has it?
You should've called ahead. Harry's in Positano with his new floozy.
He's not home now, but you can try back in a couple of hours.
Does it buy me any more time if I invest in your startup?
Is this GOP headquarters?...It's time.
It's about time! He's in bathroom.
Why don't you come back when it's not casual Friday.
He's still working n his bucket list.
Wow, Amazon do everything these days.
He's walking the dog, he'll be back in a half hour.
You think YOU had a grim day?
This isn't what I meant when I said "take me places."
"Oh, him? He's too old and tired to climb the stairs.''
Casual Friday, huh?
I'm sorry, we don't accept door to door soliciting.
I never did care much for Casual Fridays.
Later. I've got three loads going and the linoleum is still wet.
Not going anywhere with 'The Casual Reaper.'
Oh, she's in 3B
No no no... I ordered a "Large SIZE"... and where's my salad? Damn Millennials...
I don't care that your phone, car and friends all died—you broke your curfew.
I'm canvassing undecided voters.
Is that a new scythe?
Actually, I prefer to cut the ornamental grasses in the spring.
Can Billy come out and play?
No one by that name lives here.
He's not here now. Can you leave your card?
I need to see proof of citizenship.
Death, don't be so damned proud.
Why so grim, reaper?
So that annoying sniffing sound when he starts to speak isn't just a cold or allergy!
If you're going to be late coming home, be sure to give us a heads-up.
Next time don't knock, use the doorbell like everyone else.
Well, what exactly would you cut?
Mr. Bergman lives in apartment 42C.
This is an apartment. We don't have grass.
Well of course you're death, wearing a hoodie in THIS neighborhood?
I would rate that "Somewhat Funny".
I will not depart this veil of tears on a casual Friday.
Is this some creepy maneuver to get me to exercise?
Wrong! I told you this year it's creepy clown.
How was "Hell Week"?
I have no candy for you.
aren`t you early !
Not now!
Hey, Kevin.
I don't care who you are! You're not coming in here with those dirty shoes!
I'm afraid he's gone to a higher place.
You're not in uniform. I'm going to have to see some I.D.
Just missed him
She's not here...I'll tell her you stopped by.
I knew I should have watched my cholesterol!
You're right, if you had your scythe in the picture I wouldn't have swiped right.
Finally you show up! My husband is down the hall.
Just a sec--- let me grab my purse
Let me get my bong.
No clown, no candy
At least you're not a scary clown.
I gather you're not here to collaborate.
ECO-friendly lawn care...well it's about time!
I changed my mind. Hillary is winning.
Guess I'm at death's door
I don't have a treat so let's see your trick.
This is not the kind of role-play I had in mind.
Well, if it isn't the Doofus of Doom!
Forget your open carry permit?
And who do you think you are?
None of the other Uber drivers have ever come to the door before...
Why don't you pick up your stuff after the funeral?
This is 9E. You want 9B.
And after you finish the front yard you can work on the side yard.
'Dress down Friday?'
You don't have to be so casual about it.
He'll be back in 20 minutes. Care to wait? Coffee?
It's the toilet in the master bathroom.
You're not bringing that thing on our date, are you?
I don't think casual Fridays applies to Immortal Archetypes.
He's out jogging.
Mow your lawn for 10 bucks?
You're here to repossess *what*?
No, Billy, I still haven't washed your black one
He can't see you right now - he's buried in work.
Just wait 'til your father gets home.
I'd really like to go out with you tonight, but I'm dead tired.
I think he lives at Trump Tower.
You need to take off your shoes and scythe before you come in.
If I told you once, I have told you twice! Do not bring your work home with you.
What's next, seersucker?
Didn't anyone ever tell you to dress up if you want to take a woman out?
Fess up. Who have you been reaping with?
If I find out that girl you were with is still alive in the morning; you're grounded.
Tsk, tsk. White after Labor Day?
Sorry, I've given up refined carbs. You can try me again in 2073.
I expect he'll be back around seven.
Shoes off, please
Sorry, you're too late. I already signed up to be an organ donor.
Well, I suppose I'd pay quite a lot, but can it cut through a tin can?
wrong door!
Well, I'm glad I'm not the only one who didn't dress for the occasion.
You forgot to get milk.
Wipe your shoes and your scythe before you come in.
I flossed for this.
Be humane. Wait til Half Time.
Oh, sure you were just out for a walk-- I can smell the souls on your breath from here.
Too late, I've been dead for decades!
I'm not interested in your death startup.
"Sorry, but I'm really having a bad day. Could you knock on my neighbor's door? He intends to vote for you-know-who.
I guess you're not worried about second impressions
Thank God you're here; the mouse is driving me crazy.
So, This is why you dropped out of school?
Halloween really separates the wheat from the chaff.
I don't care WHO you are, you're not coming in without taking off those shoes first!
Come in! I hope you brought my new glasses.
No, I would not like to contribute to your high school's marching band's trip to Washington, DC.
I thought you'd be dressed better.
Is Death taking a fashion holiday?
You're a day late. He died yesterday.
Trump for President I presume
Now I see why they 'Don't Fear the Reaper'.
Not today. My son cut the grass.
You're to late. The clown beat you to him. He's in the back.
It's like I keep telling ya, All Lives Matter!
Really? This is what you are wearing to Career Day?
You seem to have lost the will to kill.
He said he'll meet up with you later…he's dressed as a clown.
There may well be a minimum number of boxes your daughter need to sell, but I still think you're being a bit heavy handed.
You look exactly like your profile photo.
I already have solar panels.
Wrong apartment, the millineals are two doors down.
Your online dating profile say's your someone to die for.
My husband's out, but I'll call his cell and get him right back for you.
You are too late. He passed on last week.
The Grim Groper--is that you Donald?
"So what can I do on this fine morning for the most half-assed grim reaper ever?
Thanks. I already voted by absentee ballot.
He took up jogging to IMPROVE his health...
So what are you wearing for Halloween?
Did I miss an Adobe update?
You want to grab me by the what?
"Wait, I have'nt voted yet".
What? It's not like I'm going to the funeral.
How can you be so casual about people dying?
No, you've got the address wrong. She's in apartment 12.
If I knew you were going to wear those shoes I never would have swiped right...
Is your dad on holiday?
If Hilary wins, what is your costume going to be?
I hadn't realized you observe Casual Fridays.
Yup, that's what he was wearing. I'll be right back with your check.
It finally dawned on me why you come every year without a trick or treat bag.
You used that to cut back the petunias? You're killing me.
He isn't here, he's already gone.
So Hell is freezing over?
Candygram.
I knew you sometimes come early, but underdressed as well?
He's on the golf course.
No, I'm pretty sure your mom said "why don't you size up the new neighbors."
Casual day at work?
Get a job, Morty.
He's watching the debate, but you can come in and wait for him....
So your stage name is what now, The Grim Rapper?
I'm not shuffling off this mortal coil to go with the Laid-Back Reaper.
Lemme guess. Dying for some exercise?
Bring back some of those nice bludbery muffins from Magnolia's and kill Mrs. Cohen.
More like the Grim _Creeper_, if you want my opinion.
Well, Jinkies! It's the Casual Reaper...
So I'm suppose to believe you're the Grim Reaper and it's casual Friday
He doesn't want to be disturbed.
Your home empty handed Again!?
Does this mean athleisure is dead?
I could really reap the benefits of a peephole.
Maybe I'd be concerned if you weren't wearing sneakers.
This is why I hate Casual Fridays.
Do you have an appointment?
It had better just be a phase!
Thank heaven you are not a clown!
Freelancer?
I just need a butter knife.
No, I'm the one who's supposed to be comfortable.
I don't have any candy, but feel free to take my life.
Emily says she's busy and she can't stop for you.
Sure, but where's my pizza?
You're at the wrong address. My ex is now living at 24 Dawson Drive which isn't far from here.
I just needed to borrow a butter knife.
As if creepy clowns aren't bad enough.
Look, you're not going to get me to go on a morning run with you.
Did you fail your concealed permit test AGAIN!!
She's in the back, and make it quick.
Relax, I've come for your wardrobe.
Is this about Trick or Treat or The Big Sleep?
Compared to the news, you're child's play.
I know it's Halloween, but your father's still annoyed that you borrowed his scythe without asking.
I thought you said 30 minutes or less.
I'm here to delete your account.
We're not buying whatever you're selling.
Did you use an old picture on your Tinder post?
Death Takes a Laundry Day
Finally, an October surprise with the voter in mind.
What type of Pokemon are you?
The police told me to expect a clown.
You looked more lively on your dating profile.
Come back on April 15th.
You door-to-door salesmen are going to be the death of me.
Jason, take off that silly costume and get going on your homework .
You look different that your profile picture.
What are you reaping about this time?
Well, it's certainly not casual Friday for me now.
I said, you're a grim rapper.
I'd planned to challenge you to a game of chess, but now I'm thinking "Grand Theft Auto"?
Don't tell me..."Death in the Hood."
No thank you, my husband likes to mow the lawn himself.
I know it ruined your vacation, but I told you TSA wouldn't let that thing through.
Igor is sick. He can't go reaping with you today.
When you finish the hedgers you can start on the lawn
What do you mean he told you "You're fired!"
Very funny - the lawns' not THAT overgrown.
If you can't see from under that hood of yours, I don't have any candy.
I'm here to tell you about our Early Bird special!
Let me guess. You're getting out the vote for the Trump campaign.
It's Halloween: since when does The Grim Reaper wear white after Labor Day?
You just missed that deadbeat.
Come back with a REAL lawn mower!
This casual Friday nonsense has gotten out of hand.
I heard you had rebranded yourself for a better social media image.
The election's over, Vladimir. Why so grim?
Let's revisit this discussion on November 9th.
If you'd use the darn lawnmower, the neighbors might accept our dinner invitations.
I don't suppose your casual approach to attire is indicative of a relaxed attitude toward quotas.
They outsourced this to the gig economy as well?
Casual Friday or not, I'm getting properly dressed for the occasion.
I'd kill for that hoodie.
No, you may not come in and wait for Tommy.
Really, you get casual Fridays?
You could have at least dressed for the occasion.
Try Mr. Hurwitz across the hall.
Sorry, but the 'Grandpa Dude' moved into a rest home last week.
Are you with Casual Transitions?
I hope you raked up the clippings.
Ugh, you're not as tall as you said in your profile.
Sorry there are no republicans here
Great, now nothing can kill the activewear trend.
You know, I've been looking for a better place.
Do you ever feel you might be compensating for something?
I was afraid you were going to miss dinner.
My therapist said I should start dressing for the job I want.
What part of no don't you understand?
Hey Brad, it's another empty suit selling insurance
No Scooby, we've all retired, remember?
I already told you, my husband's not home yet.
Halloween isn't until November 28.
He's hiding under the table.
This new look might not go over too well with your core demographic.
You look more grimy than grim.
You really expect me to take you back after what you did to my cat?
Well your dinner's stone cold again. Your father's going to kill you.
That's my meatloaf burning, so make it fast.
If you ask me, this casual Friday thing is getting out of control.
If you are so inevitable, then everyone can certainly wait until you have cleaned your room.
Business casual standards sure have gone to hell.
I already told the twenty people who called... I'M REGISTERED TO VOTE!
The Grim Slacker?
What the heck is this - casual death Friday?
Is that a smile I see on your face?
I know it's you Donald.
You are little late I took the sleeping pills 24 hours ago.
'Casual Friday' has now totally jumped the shark.
Are you going to actually mow the lawn or are you just doing it "ironically"?
You're late! He's in the living room.
He's not here. He's campaigning for your candidate.
You're looking for Mr. Zimmerman, I presume?
Whaddya mean you got sent home from school for wearing a hood!?
No Mrs. Goldstein is next door.
I thought you were doing "Teach for America" on your gap year.
Yes, I am voting for Mr. Trump
You just missed him, he checked out last week.
If you want people to invite you in, you might want to reconsider the hoodie.
Collecting?
You don't scare me--'Drop dead, yourself!'
Come in or you'll catch your death.
I work for Amazon now.
Can’t you just cheerfully and willingly cut the grass and bag the leaves like I asked?
Don't you people keep records? I already donated to the Clinton campaign.
We be not proud, I see.
Herbert --stop procrastinating and just mow the lawn!
Let me guess - hoodie, sweatpants, slip on loafers... Are you the "millenial" reaper? Great Halloween costume!
OK. I'll lose the turtleneck.
Well, Death takes a staycation!
When you said you had a steady job, this wasn't what I had in mind.
I don't care if "athleisure is a real thing" - I expect Death to wear a clean robe and a hard shoe.
What really kills me is how lazy you look.
I see Casual Friday truly knows no bounds.
What do you mean, this will be the last time you'll be trimming my lawn?
When I said I'd rather die than exercise, I meant no exercise in the next life, too.
Sorry, I gave generously at the office.
So, you must be my daughter’s new boo.
' I'd love to Jack. Let me get my costume. It is Jack, isn't it?'
A rappin' reaper? Not here; maybe Brooklyn.
We had our lawn cut yesterday
I'm sorry. I buy everything online.
I was surprised they matched us but my friend claims she found G-d thru the same site.
If you want causal death, you've got the wrong girl.
My dad sent me.
I was thinking of a more natural pest control method.
NO, I SAID MY HUSBAND ACTS LIKE HE'S DEAD IN BED, NOT HE'S IS DEAD IN BED.
I SAID no substitutes.
Pretty grim, Irving, not scaring me a bit. Go reap some weeds behind the shed.
Let me guess, your Halloween costume is death of a salesman.
Let me guess...the Grim Rapper?
Herb, I know the Yankees and Mets are both out of the postseason, but don't you think you're being just a little overdramatic?
Whatever my ass!
First impressions Grim... First impressions.
You look a lot taller in your profile picture.
Got rid of Bob myself... so, don't just gape at me, wipe your feet and come on in big guy.
Maybe a blind date on Halloween was not such a great idea.
We don't need you anymore; we have Trump.
Your husband may be expecting me. I understand he was given 48 hours to live about two days ago.
Okay, I get it--I'll hit the gym tomorrow.
To be honest, after the week I've had, this will be a scythe of relief.
No soliciting.
Since when do you observe Casual Fridays?
My jealous husband said you might be stopping by.
I'm literally dead.
Do we owe this visit to Obamacare?
Trick or treat---huh---let me guess, a Russian hacker?
Aren't you supposed to knock?
I'll wait for you to pick up your dry cleaning.
Wait til your father gets home!
Well, at least your not a creepy clown.
No, I can't say that I'm familiar with that Eagle merit badge project.
Sackcloth cloaks are just so medieval. I get more done in the sweatpants.
I don't care if you are a millennial. I still get to decide when my life is over.
Trim reaper? Yeah, I'm not buying it.
Casual Friday? You got to be kidding.
And how exactly does this make you an entrepreneur?
Finally you're here. I've got some clowns in the back yard that I need you take care of.
I can see through your disguise, Mr. Trump
If you're really the Grim Reaper, you'd better wipe that stupid grin off of your face!
Sorry not tonight, I've got ladies Bingo.
Does the white uniform come with a different outcome?
Can't you read?...NO SOLICITORS!
What, you couldn’t wait ‘til I lost my virginity?
And where exactly do you plan on grabbing me?
Lose the hoodie. Are you trying to get yourself killed?
It's just that I expected a bit more when he said he'd call for backup.
I'm not leaving with you dressed like THAT
I really hope your here for trick or treat.
Well, if it isn't the Dude Reaper!
He'll get tired of you too.
Some disguise... I can still see your clown face.
The flesh on your hand gave you away.
Thought you could sneak up on me with those ridiculous shoes...no way!
Well, it's about time. May I ask why you couldn't be bothered to get here before election season?
When did your boss approve casual Fridays?
Can you hang out here until the election results are in?
Reaper, why so grim?
No" means "no
I told you to kill his campaign, not ravage the entire country.
Hal,the man from the I.R.S. Is here for his money
No Donald, Hillary will not come out to play.
Where's liberty?
"Frankly, I'm sick to death of you door-to-door types".
I know it's your last day, but you could at least try to make an effort.
No, I'm sorry. That outfit doesn't slay.
You have a good costume for this political season.
Trick or Treat is tomorrow!
No, my husband doesn't need any extra help right now. I'm waiting for flu season.
Where you have been? I was so worried, I could have died.
You're not dressed like you are in the books. How do I know you're the real one?
My husband's had his for thousands of years and it's still as good as new.
So you're theTrim Reaper.
Oh, I get it, "Neither snow nor rain" etc.
You're too late. I died 20 years ago because this is obviously Hell !!
On second thought, maybe life insurance agents shouldn't 'dress for the job they want.'
What lawn service did you say you were with?
What do want, a handout? You look like death warmed over.
Really?! In a hoodie?
I'll join your canvassing effort if you tell me one thing, how does he plan to "make America great again"?
Well! You're a sight for sore scythes.
I didn't respond to your texts because I'm seeing someone else... although I can't seem to get a hold of him.
Sorry, my husband said that the office drained him of all life he had left to give.
Yeah, he's home. Don't think he's up for cutting brush, though. He say's the gas pains in his chest are real bad this morning.
Come on in. My husband will be back soon.
I know a Canadian with attitude when I see one!
Sorry, Martha moved to Hoboken. She lives in her evil twin sister's old house.
Let me guess, you're here to earn my vote?
No Hillary isn't here right now. If you leave your name and number i'll tell her you stopped by.
'Wait, lemme guess...You're an ice sculptor!"
You're not supposed to wear white after Labor say
This is a trick, not a treat, right?
Casual Fridays are still a thing.
You said we were going out--not under.
Let me guess — you want me on your hockey team.
That's better than black but lose the hoodie
Just trim the bushes in front of the house.
Is it laundry day in the afterlife or are you an old school landscaper?
You must be deaf! I told you to get a snow shovel, not a scythe!
The other guy was dressed in black and I told him the same thing. No way.
Twenty five dollars to cut the grass! Is that by the hour or what?
Yes, I know it's time to mow the lawn. How much do you charge?
Just because you scared grandma with it doesn't mean it'll scare me.
Seriously, nobody is dying to come with you in that outfit.
Very funny, Henry. You need to change or I'm not going with you anywhere.
Hi. Are you my personal escort to my polling location today?
So even you have gone business casual.
Well common' in and make yourself comfortable, he'll be back in a few minutes.
I told you last time, I'm not donating to the Trump campaign.
When you said "I'm taking your daughter out with a sickle, I envisioned two wheels and an engine, I didn't like that and I'm not wild about this either."
Sorry, this is heaven's door.
Oh great. Let me guess, your mower died again?
So--whazzup?
Too late. He died yesterday.
Forget this. The Trump costume does it this year.
Thanks for the quick response. You'll find my idiot husband downstairs in his man cave surrounded by his cigar-smoking buddies watching NFL RedZone.
And I suppose you're expecting me to just hip-hop along with you.
Parent-Teacher conferences are held on the school grounds, Mr. Lee.
Too casual. It needs to be more grim...
What do you need a knife sharpener for?
Seriously? The Grim Reaper? Casual Friday? You need to up your game.
My apartment, my Pokémons.
No trick? No treat!
Get right back in here and change that hoodie, young man. You know they make the police nervous.
It's called a scythe, people used it for cutting wheat, look we're getting off topic here.
Yeah?! What the hell do you want?
Your boss said 30 minutes or less.
No, I'm definitely not interested in your two for price of one eternal resting place sale.
Well, it took you so long to get. here, I asked my butcher to do it..
Don't worry I'm here to talk about CrossFit.
I'm busy now; can you text me?
I think this casual Friday thing is getting a little out of hand
Did David say he was going to sell his soul again?
10:30? On a school night? ... and is that your father's good scythe? Oh, he's gonna ... well, you know the rest.
Getting a bit more casual these days, huh?
A: it's not Halloween. And B: You're supposed to say Trick or Treat, not TRICK OR DIE BITCH !
We've been through this before. Come back when you're in dress code.
I'm glad you got your jogging shoes on..he just left. You may still be able to catch him.
Lack of gravitas this political season has gotten to you, too, eh?
Note to self, when you hear a knock, knock at the door, say 'who's there' before you open it!
Is this something your father encouraged you to do?
Thank you but I am already registered to vote
Okay, but clean your shoes first.
Have you tried next door? They may have something for you.
Must be Casual Friday.
Can we revisit this topic after the election?
Seriously? Go home and change your clothes…then I'll go willingly.
My daughter thinks your outlook is way too grim.
Wrong house. We're vegan.
Ok, again, you're only here collecting money for the Republican Party ?
We recycle.
I've already voted.
I would rather not stop at Walmart.
Be proud as you like, but I would not be caught dead in that thing.
It's about time. He's over on the couch.
I don't care of it is casual Friday, you still have a nerve.
This is exactly why I always campaigned for the right to Death with dignity.
Sorry, but we don't do casual Friday's here.
I'm seeking an avid reader, not an average reaper.
Even if it is cancer, it's still disrespectful to stare. My face is up here
You the termite guy?
I'm at a loss for words. What's with the snow suit? Are you lost or has Hell frozen over?
Haven’t you heard of email?
Your brochure promised results.
You must be looking for Phil S, who is 2 doors down. I'm Phyllis. Care for some candy?
The Trump campaign office is next door.
I'd say go back to the creepy clown getup.
You're past curfew and there's a killer on the loose!
He left last week. Try the guy in 5 C.
What do you mean that wearing black isn't your thing? This isn't about you!
That's about the scythe of it.
You should have had the courtesy to get here before the debate started.
No, the white clothes don't make me feel any better about this.
You know that hoodie could be deadly.
We're you jogging or harvesting souls again?
Hello Election 2016. America is in the back waiting for you.
Not until you spiff up a little bit, young man.
Nice try, Al, but I've no intention of leaving this earth until you fix the garbage disposal!
When are you going to get a real job!
I'm here to sell a sickle. I don't know anything about any blood disorder.
Come on in. I set up the chess table in the living room.
Do you at least have clean underwear on?
Oh, it's just you.
And then with Daphne gone, Fred can marry me.
Well, it's about time you updated your look.
train all you want, you're never gonna outrun yourself.
Halloween is next week.
Don't be pitiful, Josh, didn't I give you enough candies?...
Sharp new look.
Get in here before I catch my death!
He left me....
Sweatpants in public? Your father will turn over in his grave when he gets home.
Sorry I'm not coming with you-- I'm only dead tired!
Sushi delivery was always going to be a roll of the dice.
Hey Deb, life and I are fighting again. Can I crash on your couch?
I'll call him right up: anything to get him off the Xbox.
You really aren't proud, are you?
Donald Trump says you'll have to wait until November 9th.
Well you almost fooled me...until I saw the sneakers.
I don't care who you are. I don't go anywhere with a guy in a hoodie.
Forget it, the Halloween costume contest is rigged.
Death begins to rethink casual Fridays
and after you mow the lawn, take out the garbage
Sorry, I already have a subscription to the Wall Street Journal
You've been reaping again!
Ready to go?
And you promised you would be done harvesting the dead in time for dinner!
Would you believe I just gave the last piece of candy to the New Year Baby?
We gave in Iraq.
Death, can you wait till I give the other kids candy.
I told you, wait till the election is over.
You just missed him. He passed away moments ago.
I'll have to see some ID, Mr. Reaper. Neighborhood Watch rules, you know.
Cool shoes, but I'm not finished with him yet.
Next time use your key! This death comes knocking is getting old!
And I say Namaste back at ya!
I'll get 'im, but he won't be pleased about casual Friday.
Didn't your mother teach you to dress up when you pay a visit?
Do you need to see proof of health insurance?
The retired gym coach lives next door.
It's casual Friday.
Worst re-branding ever!
Goin' for irony, ya' are?! The Grim Reaper?! In activewear?!
Now that you're home, the front yard still needs raking.
Go back to the where you came from, Donald; I can see right through you.
I'm now more afraid of the creepy clown sightings.
You just missed the tax collector!
Oh, and I suppose you want to talk about religion too.
Grim Reaper who?
I said mow the lawn, not kill it.
I'm sorry, but the election isn't until November 8th.
No, I'm not the neighbor that is seeking early retirement.
You misheard me, GR. I wasn't looking for casual death.
I thought that Orange was the new black
No, I'm not going to drive you to work! Just take the subway.
No, he's out for his daily run around Central Park. Why don't you come back in 30 years?
Wha' da YOU want?
I'm already registered to vote.
Donald, you're such a bad loser.
They're sending children now?
No, I'm still not voting for her.
I heard her, too. It was Mrs. Beekman. She's above me in 407, not 307.
Wait a sec...he's in the living room.
You want some candy or are you going to stand there playing pocket pinball?
Please tell me you're just getting a jump on Halloween, right?
It's about time you found a job.
You cometh too late--dinner is over.
Are you here for my car?
Does it have benefits?
You wanna talk bio honesty? I'm way more Sally Field than you're George Clooney.
Oh my! Your hoodie scared me.
Ummm...that is definitely NOT what I meant by "I'm dying for some exercise."
Sadly, this isn't the most terrifying costume I've seen.
You're late. What took you so long?
You can have my varicose veins, hemorrhoids and dandruff; now leave me alone
Oh terrific! Now I have to die on casual Friday.
And. the "trick", dare I ask?
Don't think you're getting anywhere near the p-word after touching that filthy thing!
I don't care who you are, I won't let in anyone with a hoodie.
You make a persuasive argument,but I really feel I should sit this election out.
No, I'm not an undecided voter.
Just don't track mud on my beige carpets.
I was thinking you would have a lawn mower
Your home early!
What's this -- Death takes a hoodie?
Just give me a moment to straighten up.
I get it...my approach to the staircase was too casual.
Nice try, Irv.
OK, I'll vote for him now. I get your point.
We're eating dinner right now, but please feel free to stop by again after the election.
You won't win, David. My mother will raise the kids.
So, how much did my ex' pay you for this visit?
Might I trouble you to help me with my cole slaw salad first?
Come back later. I still have bills to pay.
Sorry, I ran out of candy.
I wouldn't normally call you in, but the kids have been whacking away at Jimmy's birthday party piñata unsuccessfully all afternoon and I have my book club coming over soon.
Willard gave out at the office.
I've told you before that you're just not believable. Your clothes aren't right and the real one doesn't wear athletic shoes! And I can see your eyes! Now go away.
He's not real sweet, but you can have my husband.
I know they say it's the silent killer, but can I borrow a cup of sugar?
But my DVR is still full!
Well, that would explain where you've been all this time.
I think you're looking for George Zimmerman.
Didn't you learn that taking women against their will is only okay if you've eaten a Tic Tac first?
Honey - it's the Grin Reaper!
Mr. Grimm Reaper, didn't your mother teach you how to dress? Over my dead body can you enter this house with dirty sneakers and sweatpants!
You again! I told you before, I'm not interested in buying your used scythe!
For the last time, Dad, it's a retirement COMMUNITY.
I guess my doctor did not call you. The diagnosis was wrong.
Too late, my self-esteem died years ago.
Well, if all proceeds benefit local schools, how can I say no?
I was like, 'Quit using that phone!' And he was all, 'Why?'
Aren't you taking this business casual look too far?
Oh, he is one flight up.
He's in the man cave watching the ballgame
You'll be wanting to visit Loud Larry, three doors down.
Sorry, I'm voting third party
So you agree that depending on the outcome Nov. 8th, I will go willingly?
And you tell your dad he can come down right on down here himself if he wants my eternal soul so bad.
Trick or trick.
At least you aren't Donald Trump.
So your not with the landscapers!
"I did not expect you until November 9th of this year".
White, conservative, boring, prudish housewife's life's matters too ya know.
Is there any way to just knock me on the side of the head with that sickle and put me into a slight coma twilight thing until Nov 9th?
You are a little too early...! Coffee, tea, a game of chess...?
I know it's casual Friday, but do you have to whistle?
No, we ordered a GRAIN reaper.
I can't play with you Billy, my mom says you'll be the death of me.
He's gone to Canada
I need the $50 upfront, and the scythe stays outside.
Trick or treat, eh. And what might the treat be?
Well, if you're the grim reaper, it seems to me you're being a little too casual about it.
The lout left me last month...and if you find him, remember I called first dibs.
Nice Halloween costume, but you have the wrong address. The Republican Party is next door.
What do you mean you met your quota and are just going for a stroll?
You took him last year, don't you remember?
If you are looking for Donald Trump, he already grabbed my P***Y and left. Try finding him on the next floor.
Not today. Please call ahead.
Hello, my name is America 2017.
You're late. He's in the kitchen complaining about how much weight Miss America has gained.
The commercial said 30 minutes or less.
Sorry, I already have a yardboy.
What's this, casual Friday??
I pray this is 'your way' of telling me my gym membership has expired?
I already made it clear, it will be a cold day in Hell before I take you back.
Sorry, he's busy right now.
#MyLifeMatters
Rough day on the job dear?
Oh for crying out LOUD... Jimmy why don't you stand up straight and dress for success?
Apparently the 'no solicitors' sign doesn't apply to you, or maybe you just can't read."
Sorry, but I've run out of candy.
Are you death or my incompetent 15-year-old joke of a son?
I'm sorry - I gave at the office.
If you don't change to nicer clothes, I'm not coming with you.
Sweatpants and a hoodie? Really?
Please tell me this is only an early Halloween visit!
What are you now, the Slim Reaper?
Being a millennium-old doesn't mean you get to act like a Millennial
This athleisure thing has gone too far.
You could have told me it was Casual Friday.
You're too late!
The Millennial of Death.
Can you come back after Rachell Maddow?
I just can't trust you anymore. You promised you would take my aunt in her sleep.
He's out right now. Come back later.
So, this is what happens to all the third party votes...
That's right. If I beat you in Madden NFL 16, I live.
You just missed him, he's at work.
I beat you fair and square at chess.
He's watching TV.
Her cake was actually mediocre.
These casual Fridays are killing me.
I see you came in business casual.
If it's okay with you, I would really like to pull the plug.
Sorry, I'm not here right now. Why don't you come back when I'm out?
When you told me that you landed an upper management position, I wasn't expecting this!
But I didn't have the salmon mousse.
A tip? You were 3 hours late.
He's not home, but I can take a message.
Very funny. No candy for you!
No, we don't want our trees pruned.
The hoodie is a nice, but pants are too baggy.
Don't you know that candy will rot your teeth? But, then, you probably don't care.
Up to you. I'm going to take the stairs.
You could have at least called ahead.
Let's table this discussion until after the election.
You'll have to remove your shoes before walking on the carpet.
So, you charge extra to bag the grass?
If you're looking for the 'Trump Pence 2016' campaign office, it's down the block and to the right
I recommend Donald Trump to you as the next person you call on.
I don't care if you are with the Hillary Clinton campaign, there is no way that you will get my vote.
Take your hand and JOG towards the light?
I need to see three pieces of ID before I can let you in.
And what have you been up to, Young Man?!
I'm not going with you if you're dressed like that.
Sorry I can't. My last meal was a salad.
Is that the best you can up with for Halloween?
Listen here "dude", I dunno who fam is but I don't think I wanna go where it's "lit".
You should dress for the job you want.
I guess Millennials really *are* taking over the job market.
Wrong address - the RNC is down the hall!
He's in the back room. And if you can decapitate Pokemon--it may have the biggest effect.
What do you mean Trump sent you?
I told him he'd pay big-time for going out tonight.
I just don't think I'm the kind of girl you would be attracted to.
NO, I DID NOT VOTE...
Oh, wrong date and place, on Nov. 8th, go to Trump's place!! He will be waiting for you!
No, Neighborhood Watch is in 3B.
Of course I require references if you want to cut our grass.
Can you come back after the elections?
TRICKING OR TREATING?
Why does it always have to be Netflix and chill with you?
It's dangerous for a young man to walk around with a hood on like that.
Be careful....George Zimmerman lives in this neighborhood.
He just left to meet an UBER out front. You can probably catch him.
Netflix and KILL? Since when is that even a thing?
I told you you've taken business casual too far.
We don't need you this year because of the drought.
No, the 'c' is silent.
It's casual Friday in the afterlife.
Avon calling? Really? You've stooped to that?
Obamacare is no excuse for why you can't get your work done on time.
Was the scythe made in China, too?
The Grim Uber.
Grim Lucifer Damien Reaper! Did you lose your shroud again?
In some neighborhoods YOU could be shot dressed like that.
You're wearing sneakers? And I thought Life was unfair!
She's deceased.
You're too late, my dating life died ten years ago.
It's not even Halloween, wierdo.
I already told you I'm not voting for him!
No, Jimmy can't come out and play.
You really shouldn't wear a hoodie around here.
Yeah, sure Biff. I'm terrified. Now get back to clearing the weeds in the backyard.
Ashley is not old enough to be going out with the likes of you!
The election isn't supposed to be for another month.
Well your the first to complain that I look better than my profile picture.
Frank, stop fooling around! Tom cannot come out and play golf with you!
She's not ready.
Wrong apartment. The "Seventh Seal" party is in 3A.
No, I don't have time to talk with you right now. I'm very busy. You don't have to be so grim about it.
You're going to be the death of me, buddy boy, you know that, don't you?
Sorry, the lawyers cancelled our Seniors 20K Fun Run.
He's out with some friends. But if you'll give me your name and number, I'll let you know when he gets home.
But mom, my friends are dying to hang out with me tonight.
We're trying to attract more Millennials.
Honey, there is someone here to grab me, it's the Grim Groper, soliciting campaign donations.
I hope you're here for the election.
Did you remember to trim the hedges in the back yard?
Do you know the rules of Old Maid?
I hope I could skip the election season, too.
White hoodie and sensible shoes! What makes you think I wouldn't like Burning Man?
The Millennial lives across the hall.
Did you watch Mr Trump on TV this morning? That was scary!
I knew I shouldn't have believed that Jehova's Witness.
I don't do Halloween.
Couldn't you just once be the cheerful reaper?
Hello, Def.
Just a moment. Mr. Trump is ready for you and he'll be right down.
Sorry, I don't know where Scooby is.
What are you collecting for, "sickle cell anemia?"
This better be a Halloween costume.
Would it kill you to show a little respect?
I refuse to go quietly on casual Friday!
A casual workplace discussion on end of life issues.
You're too late. Halloween was weeks ago.
Hey! It's not election day yet.
Sorry, I don't grow any wheat.
That outfit's pretty grim.
You look deadlier than your profile pic.
Nope, nobody by the name of American Democracy at this address.
This athleisure wear thing has been done to death.
Please come back in a week. The grim field is almost ripe.
No, I don't think the Republican Party will die.
I gave at the office.
You expect a tip?
Huh, so it was death knocking on my door.
Please leave, Stanley. And take your half baked metaphors with you.
It's watching tv. Try not to be too bloody, I just had the carpets cleaned.
Don't 'late-night MRSA' me, mister. You are so grounded!
Come back after I nullify the divorce.
Hi Peggy, sorry to bother you. Do you have a cup of cyanide I can borrow
Well, some people still treat dying as an occasion!
The Neighborhood Watch blocked your reaping? I told you not to wear that hoodie
*&*% and the pale horse you rode in on.
It must be Friday.
He's on the way to work, you can meet up with him there.
You reap what you sow
I'm glad you got rid of that silly clown face
Ah, yes... The millennial trick-or-treater returns. Your basement lair awaits.
I'm sorry to be the one to tell you, but everybody is replacing their lawns with astroturf.
Wait! Don't tell me: You offed my husband during his morning run. Right?
Come back Monday. Maybe I'll have something for you to reap then.
Go home Halloween is not until the 31st
Trick... I choose trick.
Can you come back tomorrow?
Jinkies! Fred, Daphne, Shaggy, Scoobie, you've got to see this!
Apparently, when I said, 'You're going to be the death of me', you got the wrong idea.
So much for blowing off the 'best before' date.
Jeepers creepers Where'd you get those reepers?
Eh-at least you aren't a killer clown.
"I reap for food.
No worries, I'm here for the millennial.
You could have at least texted me first.
Not until I see your Grim-Reaper's license!
He's not home from work yet, he's a little behind in his audits.
Honey, Death is at the door. Trump won.
You look tired. Why don't you try clownsourcing the workload?
There's some mistake,I ordered a sweeper not a reaper.
C'mon. Just do it.
Let me guess. You didn't choose the reaper life--the reaper life chose you.
No wonder the mortality rates are falling. You obviously failed to read " Dress for Success".
Wow, Avon is full service
It's the running shoes that gave you away.
You are a bit old for trick-or-treat.
At least you're not a scary clown running for president.
Do you think jogging will generate endorphins to lift your depression?
The tip is included, right?
I don't care who you are. I'm not voting for you just because you're less evil than the other two!
I'm afraid George said he was, 'dying to meet you.'
Well, If you need to kill something, you could harvest our wheat.
Crap Belichick, you really did make a deal with the devil
How was your jog?
I said Netflix and CHILL.
HR is really enforcing Casual Friday now.
Did you not see the 'No Soliciting' sign by the doorbell?
Well, Madeline did tell me you were to die for.
I'm not the peppermint Patti your looking for.
How many times must I tell you our wheat has already been scythed into sheaves?
I've never heard of 'Reapers for Sickle Responsibility'.
That's a rap.
Sorry. Melania gave you the wrong apartment number.
Don't threaten, Donnie. A simple trick-or-treat will do.
Forget the $20 to remove the tree. I'll give you a crisp $100 to take out my husband!!
I was expecting the plumber, but you'll fiz my problem, too.
You look more like a sweaty jogger than the harbinger of death.
You're late. He's in the shower.
Hoodies don't scare me.
Oh, so it's you again.
I can recommend a very good plastic surgeon
Your casual Friday isn't my casual Friday.
You're here to do my husband's pedicure?
How many times do I have to tell you? Nobody is going to take you seriously wearing a hoodie.
Phil! Come meet our new neighbor: he's been asking around for you apparently.
You can come in but you'll have to wait. Donald's been avoiding taxes, too.
Is this really the best you can do in the new gig economy?
How can you? We are the Joneses who everyone is keeping up with!
The jogging outfit may fool them but the sickle is a DEAD giveaway!"
I'm sorry, but Halloween is still two weeks away.
No one by that name here. Sorry.
Sorry, it's not here. The GOP is on the 13th floor.
Before I scream in terror and faint, can you show me some ID that you're the real deal?
I've been waiting for you for 60 years, the least you can do is dress up for me.
It's about time you showed up.
Don't just stand there; come in. I'm not supposed to catch a draft.
You can start with the grain out back.
I'm sorry, I just can't take someone in athlesiure seriously.
GOP? They're two houses down.
Wear that hoodie one more time and you're dead to me.
And your mother lets you go out dressed like this?
I'll go with you when you get a full length robe and ditch the sneakers.
Have you thought about upgrading to a Weed Eater?
I'll get your dad.
Sorry about your wife. So I guess you're single now, right?
Casual Friday or not, I'm not going with you.
Slacking off, aren't you? You'll find my husband in the living room watching football...
I know it's hard to tell, but the nineties are dead.
You claimed to be taller in your Tinder profile.
Two hours late for dinner. You're dead.
Son, someday you're really going to kill me
You can start out back, but watch out near the woodpile -- we saw a copperhead there last week.
Rebrand?
Finally, I'm going to get rid of all those weeds in my garden!
The dude is in the garden cutting his grass
Sorry, Mr. O'Leary has been in heaven for a full half hour....
I guess you didn't know those brownies had nuts in them.
Lucky you. My boss still hasn't embraced casual Friday.
Come right on in. I'm just trying to decide what song this fat lady will sing!
Nice! The personal touch. I guess you guys aren't on Facebook yet.
It's nice you could drop by and kill some time.
I can't see you in a hoodie.
Would it kill you to get a welcome mat?
I guess you had 'eternal nothingness to wear"
When you finish with the south pasture, you can come back for some lemonade.
"Candy gram?" Really?
He took a holiday.
Wait. . . . wait, don't tell me! . . . .Your scythe is out of grass?
Fascinating strategy, but I'm with her.
This is the eighth time you've made this mistake. You're not a cat person are you?
Grateful about what?
So, how much to just trim it?
Yes, I said WIPE YOUR FEET FIRST.
I see HR finally approved casual Fridays
I don't have any candy for you... come back in twenty years.
So then, you're not from Ralph's Lawn & Garden?
Kids! Your friend is here
No, you're dead! Even if you do have a part time job, you can't move back home.
Ugh, this date is going to be death.
You won't visit for your sister's wedding but you will if I fake a heart attack?
Sorry, I'm with her. America's already great
A little old for trick or treats, aren't you?
Where have you been?
What do you mean, you're here to grab my kitty?
Sorry about the weiner dog. Just didn't see him.
Ugh, now I'm going to be late.
Greetings,your daughter inlaw sent me.
Your hoodie scares me.
Sorry, some women have heard about your track record.
Hello, may I speak with the Republican Party please?
Any self-respecting grim reaper knows hoodies were jejune from Day One.
Grim? I've seen grimmer presidential debates.
I don't want to stereotype you because of the hoodie, but…
I already voted absentee.
This is an unexpected visit.
We provide real change and a viable alterative to the two party system.
Don't be so casual about it.
... I don't think so.
Sorry, I'm late. I was in the middle of a 'killer' workout and lost track of time.
Sorry to disappoint. Mr. O'Hara left on the nine-thirty train to Samarra.
Sexting is not how I want to flirt with death.
It will be over my dead body before you get $5.00
Can we reschedule for Wednesday? Something actually good came up tonight.
Sorry. Wrong hood.
I'm busy right now. You'll have to come back later.
ALL lives matter, Travon.
Should I be expecting Charon to be in a Speedo?
Even you celebrate casual Friday?
no, there is no one here right now, including me
And what mini-series would you be?
...and Mrs. McFay didn't give you any candy!?
Casual Friday the 13th adds insult to mortal injury.
Well, I expected you'd at least wear a tie for the occasion.
Thank you kindly for stopping since I couldn't stop for you.
We've already got a landscaping service...sorry.
Yes. Of course I'll support youth in Asia.
Well, I'm sorry, but 'Death offers a new fitness program' is not a winning slogan.
But this is the address that was listed on airbnb.
I told you to be here three hours ago! I had to cook dinner for him - and I was planning on going out with my friends tonight!
So it a Father & Son racket now?
Another internship? I can't think there's much future in it.
If the dry-cleaners ruined your cloak, you should be visiting them instead of me.
You went out for cigarettes 12 years ago. Now what?
Great, you were expelled and now this.
Casual Friday.
you have any nut allergies?
I'd slit my wrists before I let you in here. Not with that posture.
You show up late, you can't be bothered to dress up, and you expect a smile?
Either you are just tall ...or God is being ironic...either way; we are out of candy.
I will not entertain a Grim Reaper in casual attire.
How was the harvest?
Does this look like a hay field?
Wow, the "athleisure" trend sure died fast.
How did you get past George Zimmerman?
try wearing a clown suit, Good-bye!
Your Halloween pranks will be the death of me
The scythe is fine but lose the hoodie.
You again? I thought I just told you we don't have any candy.
Sorry... it's casual Friday
I thought The Donald said he was funding his own campaign?
I didn't realize downticket looked that bad
Hi, I'm from Death by Scythes.
I told you not to talk to the career advisor about your hobbies.
He said he first needs to floss.
Why didn't you knock first?
So tell me, how was your holiday?
I'm not buying the jogging act.
You again? I told you, I don't want to buy cookies.
This is exactly what happens when you institute "casual Friday".
Your profile said you were taller.
Sorry, but I got nothing on the fear meter; try a clown costume.
Cut your lawn for ten bucks lady.
You're a little late, Frank died 7 years ago.
You were *supposed* to be here an hour ago.
I didn't mean "till death due us part" literally!
You're going to have to excuse the mess. My affairs are not in order.
I'm glad you're working, son, but just how long is the gig's lifetime contract?
I thought I swiped left on you
Is this casual Friday?
She's already in bed with your cousin, Sleep.
Are you wearing Crocs?
You're too late--I've already cut the cord.
'Herman, there's someone at the door about our overdue rent."
Yes, I'd love to donate to "All Deaths Matter"
This whole Casual Fridays thing has gone too far.
This isn't another Grim Reaper joke, is it?
So, on Casual Friday you just come to say, "Howdy-doo?"
Look, Mr. Loman, I've already told you we're not interested.
Unbelievable. You do realise it was supposed to be last week?
That cold you gave me last week is gradually getting worse.
OK then, it's the last time I ask. Clean up your room!
You're late. Second door on the right.
It's rude to knock.
You have my vote.
Well thanks, but we already have a landscape service.
Sweats? You must be bored to death.
We haven't even bought any candy yet. Can you come back on the 31st?
Terminal fashion makeover: I'm your first and last stop.
No, I have never heard the saying, "Death be not over-dressed for a date".
I still only have the standard-color M&Ms.
My husband gave at the office.
You think it's funny? Trick or treating at the hospital?
I spilled bleach on the cloak
Sneakers? Am I supposed to run for my life?
Didn't you know that my husband died unexpectedly last week?
No, you misheard. There's no such thing as casual die-days.
"Thank you for asking, but I won't be voting for Trump this go-around".
...so I don't deserve a little "dress for success"?
David's doing his workout right now, perhaps you can come later?
Couldn't you have come before Trump ran?
What's this? The opening's in Soho. You always wear black.
You must have the wrong address. I signed up for the do not die list.
Do we have shag carpets? Why no.
Between seasons we also do lawns...
ok, ok, if it's that grim, I'll vote.
We also get casual Friday's unless it falls on the 13th.
You wanna watch the rest of the game with us?
Can you come back later, he just left for his daily jog.
You're too late. The other guy took him.
Orange who?
I wouldn't be caught dead with such a slacker.
I lost my keys reaping
How many times do I have to tell you, we don't need our trees trimmed!
Honestly, would it have killed you to dress up a little bit for our date?
What do we got here, a dead ringer of my doorbell!
You're too late; he has already passed.
You look like life.
Ok, son, we get a lawn mower.
Loose the hoodie and I will consider giving you some Halloween candy.
They are calling it 'The Trump Effect'.
I'm sorry you just missed him, Slacker Death.
Now I understand why you charge me by the hour to cut my lawn.
That hoodie will scare everybody!
Hi I'm Ryan, I'm subbing in for Grim today.
Sorry, we use a tractor now.
Sorry if I'm fresh out of niceties today. But I keep telling you he doesn't get home until after 5 and, no, you can't wait here.
No, Mr. Zimmerman has not lived here for some time.
Where's your pillowcase?
....uh HEY KIDS!! Can someone please bring me the bowl of candy! And tell your father there's someone here with Playboy VIP Box SuperBowl Tickets!!!!
This is Scooby Doo...the set for the Simpsons is across the way.
No, this is room 504. The future of their campaign is in 506.
I expected that your lawn service company would be a little more high tech.
The other door.
Run myself to death? I don't think so.
Did you see my "No Soliciting" sign?
Gym membership expirations day I'm guessing.
You must be the ice machine repairman.
I don't have any candy. Didn't you see my porch light was off?
For God's sake take that hoodie off! It makes you look too sinister.
I know you wanted to update the look, but its too "inner city"
I think you'll find George Zimmerman a couple of doors down from here.
Casual grim on a weekday?
What your black cloak at the cleaner's?
Wrong night, fella. It's not Halloween.
You're from the IRS?
I haven't bought the candy yet
No , I said it's the wrong SIZE !
I know you aren't planning to take me out wearing sweatpants!
Aren't you suppose to be a clown?
I don't care if you're the real slim shady... there's no one here named Arthur.
Sorry sonny, I don't want to 'hang'. I don't want to get cut or lit or hammered or fried or stoned or smashed.
Hi! What's with the hood and sneakers?
In your Casual Friday attire? Have you no dignity?
Huh, you think that scares me--- then you should follow the Presidential Election race, it's down-right chilling.
But I don’t remember ordering a scythe.
You passed the background check, so come on in. The kids are already asleep.
No Mr. Zimmerman lives next door.
I'd invite you in, but I'm afraid that may cause me to eternally rest.
What landscaping company did you say you were representing?
I'm sure whatever you're taking up a collection for is already a lost cause.
I hope this is "Trick or Treat."
I have all the insurance I need.
You don't frighten me; I worked at MVD for 15 years.
I couldn't possibly go out with you looking like that!
Fine. But I can assume by your attire, you'll at least make this quick?
Take, take, take. Why don't you bring me something?
Eternity? Save your spiel. Life is too short.
Screw John Donne...don't be a slob.
That does to count as soliciting
"You missed him. My guess is that he is skiing "Widow Maker".
Just let me grab my hammer and we can go, Putin.
Madam, THIS is what a dangerous man in a hoodie looks like. Learn the difference.
Hello from the other siiide...
You don't look like a lean, mean death machine to me.
He's dead.
Someone call an exterminator?
For the five hundredth time - I didn't mean to use bleach.
Your internet service will be out for the rest of the day.
Well, some will find the hoodie more menacing.
All this time, I really have been older than death.
I'm afraid he's not here. He said he had an appointment in Samarra.
Black is more slimming.
You must be one of Mark's friends from Facebook.
What a coincidence. I was just reading John Donne's poem when you ran g the bell.
You're two weeks and 40 years too early.
Have you found your Lord and Savior Jesus Christ? Good.
Your depression has gotten completely out of hand, dear.
Hi I'm here to pick up your daughter.
No, thank you. WE already have a garden service
Remember--business casual next time.
Casual dress Friday in the afterlife?
Mr. Smith cannot come out to play after what happened last time. He's still in the hospital.
I'll give you GRIM if you don't get away from the door.
Hillary?
Well at least leave your shoes outside, I just cleaned the living room.
COME ON IN< I'VE BEEN DYING TO MEET YOU!
Thanks, but we already have Cutco.
Your mother allows you to dress like that?
"Are you here to trim the shrubs" ?
Looks like you've gained some weight.
'' I think it's between this or my Killer Clown outfit''
What d'you mean I'M looking pretty grim?
Is that really what you're gonna wear tonight?
Thanks, but I already defrosted it.
You're a harbinger of WHAT?
Can Johnny come out and play?
Scythe to meet you, too.
No candy for you, buster.
Watch out for the police.
I'm not going anywhere with you until you change out of that dreadful outfit.
You must be the new neighbor. No loud noise after midnight, mister.
Netflix and kill?
No, not even for a Scooby snack.
If you're here for candy or me, I'm out.
I think that hoodie is to die for!
Not today Grim, I got Life-alert.
Too late. The clown was just here.
Let me guess, its "Casual Friday", right?
You're too early. I haven't put my face on.
I don't want to see you back here until you've done some serious soul searching young man.
No, I'm not interested in the layaway plan.
Wait. The election isn't over 'til November 8.
Velma's hookups are scary.
If you're trying to look less grim, maybe you should lose the scythe.
You're going to shovel snow with that?
He'll be back shortly. I hope you have better ideas than the ones I've tried.
Sorry, I'm out of candy corn.
Where else? Trying to cheat death at the 5K run.
This just really isn't a convenient time.
If you need time to change, I can wait.
You, Sir, are no Robert Redford.
I wish my boss believed in Casual Friday.
Sorry, he no longer lives here.
Well, we could use someone to rake the leaves..
Reap what you sow. Get home early. Liver tonight.
I think you need to open up a bit.
Can you wait a second? I'd like to Snapchat this.
We've implemented casual Fridays to attract more Millennials.
It may be casual Fri, Mrs Wilson, but it's your time anyway.
You may want to reconsider that costume if you plan on mingling at the party.
My husband's laying in the back yard, ready for planting.
you don't look anything like you tinder pic.
What? Death arriving in sport shoes? Show some class!
You're late... By about forty years.
Halloween is a ways off,but since you're here,the weeds need mowing .
You come here every Halloween like it'll lessen the blow, I'm telling you I'm not going until my husband does.
I knew we'd be dancing, but I'm just not ready for hip hop.
My husband is in the back. He's the one you're looking for.
You obviously didn't hear about my new immunotherapy.
I say just go with the hoodie.
What do you mean you're from Blue Cross Blue Shield. I thought I was locked into the Bronze plan!
No, Donald, I don't want to be 'boned' by you.
I'm not going to start jogging now, even if it is all down hill.
Don't be late. It's a school night.
It's over Greg.
Alice does not live here anymore.
This is great, I work for the IRS! We're a sure thing!
You were here ten minutes ago wearing devil horns. I'M OUT OF REESE'S PIECES!
Casual Friday? I guess death does have its perks.
Would it kill you to dress up once in a while?
Party Pooper.
...but it's casual Friday
I think you want Joan next door.
Look dear, I don't mind the sicle, but the hoodie looks so threatening....
Well that explains the running shoes.
...more like the Grime Reaper, if you ask me.
You have a curfew, you know.
And I'm going to wait to speak with your father.
Did you remember to pick up the milk?
Sorry, but the 13th floor is upstairs.
So this is one of our more specific CUTCO packages...
But he's part of your walking group.
What kids took your candy?
To tell you the truth I overreacted to early polls.
Alright, you can stay in the basement for a week, but after that, I want you out finding souls to reap!
You don't look so grim I'll take the trick.
My goodness!! You look like death warmed over
You can't be Death. You're supposed to play chess, not jog!
You appear more goth in person than on your Facebook profile.
Yeah, I'm back... this election is sucking the life outta me.
I'm just surprised the coach of the Patriots moonlights.
I challenge you to a game of mahjong.
I knew someday you'd come, but I never expected you to look like my niece's boyfriend, Ted.
Despite the lack of effort on your costume, I'm still swaying on the side of 'treat'.
I'm not certain that the Grim Rapper is a viable costume choice, Kevin...
She's just getting dressed, she'll be out in a minute.
Cute hoodie.
Well Mr. Dillon, it looks like our time is up for today. Same time next week?
Oh, you're probably looking for the tailor down the hall.
So, you're lawn service?
This isn't what I had in mind when I suggested role-playing.
You're rather untimely. I had to watch the Presidential debate with Harold.
My daughter is just not ready for the kind of commitment you're looking for.
Taking a holiday...or just a casual day?
Good morning, ma'am. I'm your new life insurance agent.
I feel like there's a crucial step we're missing.
You're late... I hope you have a good excuse?
No thank you. My husband does the weed whacking.
That's really not a good way to start a lawn service business.
"Trick or treat?" Who the hell are you--Death Takes a Spa Day?
You'll be the death of me, yet!
You've got some explaining to do.
It's about time. Your flyer says "30 minutes or it's free"
You're really letting yourself go.
Don't quit your day job, son.
I was out jogging ma'am, so I thought I would just swing by.
Sorry, but there aren't any millennials at this address.
Yes, I am voting for a third party candidate. Why do you ask?
The dating service said you wanted someone dressed fit to kill.
I'm not going anywhere with 'The Groovy Reaper'.
Sorry, but this occasion requires formal dress!
You are killing me, please take off your shoes!
So you say you are the Grim Rapper?
Sure, little Donald would love to go out and play. Hillary can't go though.
Because I could not stop for death, he kindly stopped for me.
I keep telling you, Harold, my mother's just stopping by for a few minutes!
Your late, he's already gone!
They send you for the millennials?
I told you those light-up sneakers would help.
No, I will not sign your petition to 'clean up the neighborhood.'
You can't even dress up for a funeral?!
Funny, you don't look Jewish.
No, I don't want to see the Giants slaughter the Eagles.
Seriously, a clown outfit would work better!
You took your time getting here. Don't you know there are thousands of immigrants who would kill to have your job?
Are you my new landscaper?
The hedge is out the back door.
There's no such thing as casual dieday.
You must be the millennial intern.
A scythe is just a scythe,...a case of do or die, as time goes by.
MY HUSBAND IS NOT HOME, COME BACK LATER.
Just missed him -- he went up the staircase 30 minutes ago.
I never expected you on casual Friday.
I swear if you get one drop of blood on my good carpet... I'm outta here!
Why don't you just file for divorce?
You're late. The coroner took him an hour ago, still kicking and screaming.
Thank goodness you're here: that crabgrass will be the death of me.
You're not the plumber!
Am I overdressed?
I was wondering when you'd come back begging.
I worked with the grim reaper, he was my greatest nightmare, you are no grim reaper!
I prefer "creative destruction reaper..."
And exactly WHERE have you been?
The Grim Reaper takes a Casual Day.
No, he can't come out and play. He's dead!
If you really are the one who handles yappy little dogs, then I have to ask where the hell you've been the last five or ten years.
Yes, neighbors are complaining, but no, I won't hire you to cut the lawn.
Really Death, now you're a slacker!!!
Hi, Is Mr. Trump in?
I can't believe I died on a Casual Friday.
When did you get the new hoodie?
Do I look like Paul Ryan's credibility?
You're late. He left for the office 15 minutes ago.
Donald sent me
I already gave at the Trump rally.
You're fired.
Oh, he got tired of waiting for you here. He said you can catch up with him at the track.
She's running late for her date with you.
You're a little too old to be selling Girl Scout cookies, aren't you?
Sure thing my ass.
I don't care what Trump said young man, you cannot terrorize the neighbors.
We haven't paid taxes in decades, so yes, I'm certain you're at the wrong luxury apartment.
Is this a robo call??
Where have YOU been all my life?
In this house scythe does matter!
you're a day late - we sit shiva tonite
These costumes get stranger every single year.
No you can't borrow my WiFi password.
No thanks, I already ordered one on 'Amazon'.
I thought Trump pulled his campaign out of Virginia.
Well, at least you found job.
Sorry, we're all knitters here.
Can you come back in an hour?I'm watching the debates.
Nice try on the Casual Friday costume, but your scythe is a dead giveaway.
Looking for the river Styx?
I'm sorry, there are no "slackers" living in this house.
He's not ready. He hasn't finished doing his taxes yet.
This year we're offering thin mints, tagalongs, and do-si-dos.
You're late; have you been harvesting Pokémon again?
I get this all the time since they haven't changed the lobby directory.
I stopped watching Bergman films a long time ago.
You're wearing THAT to your inauguration?
You don’t look anything like your profile on Myth.com.
you're too late-he's already gone
Yes, I apologize Madam. My good outfit is in the wash.
Whatever happened to a sense of occasion?
So, your canvassing for both partys?
No, Kanye, just - no.
He'll be down in a second; but I've got first dibs on the X-Box
Rude of you to show up at my doorstep without texting first.
This is 3B. The Great Barrier Reef is the next floor up.
I know it's Halloween son, but I told you not to come home 'til you have a job.
Can't you find someone more deserving? Maybe like someone who's gonna vote?
So your plan is to make America great again? Right!
(Sigh) "You're late."
any other time... you're late
You're late for dinner. And what is Aleppo?
I don't care if it is casual Friday, you could have put some effort into it!
I'm sorry, but I said I was a fan of "Def" Jam.
His rally's next door.
Would you mind just coming back later? I have some reports I can't be late on.
Stand up straight, like me!
You're early. And, the invitation said "Traditional Dress".
I understand you're trying to modernize, but the app said you'd be here three hours ago.
Sorry, I gave at the office.
I'm honored you asked, but I really don't have time to be in the Grunge Reaper's posse, I'm already in Oprah's book club and have Zumba twice a week.
No, your neighbor was not home. Would you come with me, please?
You're here for my husband in sweats and sneakers?!?
It's past your curfew.
In that schlumpy outfit, no one would fear the reaper!
I really appreciate you lending me that scythe, you're a life saver.
They're calling it Deathleisure. It's the next big thing.
You are late again, Steve! Your job is not a matter of life and death.
So you're the Bastard that killed Nana!
I'm sorry, we had an argument, and he left and did not leave a forwarding address
Not now! The debate is about to begin.
Love to help you, but just harvested the crops!
Hi. You should have been here an hour ago after I got home from work. My heels were killing me, but I switched to loafers to fix dinner.
Is that you, Donald?
It may be rent stabilized, but just ask the doorman how much he'll miss my holiday cookies.
A plague you say. Late nights out because of high demand you say. Now I find out they discovered a cure months ago!
That's a shame about the old paper boy.
Oh good, you got my text: weed wacker's in the repair shop.
Don't expect a tip; you were 15 minutes late!
Actually, he's on neighborhood watch, tonight!
Mrs. Reaper, this was out on the lawn again. I almost killed myself tripping over it.
No, Mikey still cannot come out to play!
I'm the new gardener
Thank goodness! Your father would have died if you had joined a gang!
Yes, I know he's late.
The irony is you're grounded.
Oh, and stay away from the clowns.
Wearing a tie wouldn't kill you, Jack.
Don't be alarmed. My name's Jim. Jim Reaper. Grim is just my uncle.
I dont care if you were at the library with your friends. I expect you to be home by 10 PM.
We are not interested in your encyclopedia.
Somehow I think I'll pull through.
Not only are you at the wrong address but you also have the wrong era.
Is that your new putter?
Lose the hoodie and I'll deal with you November 8.
I forgot my Fitbit.
I don't care what you're wearing Frank. I still don't believe you were at the gym.
Come back when you're much older.
I didn't cheat you!
I'm all out of candy this year
I gave at the office! Remember? Fred? The copy machine? The explosion?
Gee, thanks so much for dressing up for the occasion.
Aren't you a little young to be a Grim Reaper?
Oh come in, you're just in time for dinner!
I have to say, that's the worst Halloween outfit I've ever seen.
Death, if you want to act young , then try hanging with young people.
I thought this was a date.
So glad you do home delivery.
I'm like the other dude but a bit more chillaxed
Morty's Lawn Service?
Casual Friday, eh Grimmy?
I had some time to kill so I mowed the neighbors for free.
I'll go with you if you tell me what that thing could do for my glutes.
Larry, please comeback on the real Halloween.
Be right back. Just give me a second to grab my running shoes and my Fitbit.
You don't leave anything to chance. Unfortunately, I can't run in these shoes.
It's been 10 years, Tom, and rekindling old sparks isn't exactly what you're known for.
If you want supper, you will have to leave the scythe outside.
Sorry, ran out of treats.
Yes, that dang ice maker is on the blink again.
I told you. You're not getting paid until the lawn is finished.
'Kill me now' as an expression!
I won't be voting this year.
Sorry, but I just bought a robotic lawnmover.
Who sent you, Scooby or Shaggy?
I'm sick and tired of your doom and gloom, and I just don't have time for it.
Today's youth...can't they dress appropriately for a job?
Obamacare finally got me!!
No! You should have known he had an identical twin.
You're too late. He died ice fishing. Not drowned, bored to death.
You couldn't have gotten here before the primaries ended?
It's hard to take you seriously when you uptalk.
I told you to become a doctor.
"So where have you been this time? And don't you give me that reaping-is-hard-work line again".
You are early. The election is next month.
You said dress professionally
Where have you been, son? You look like death warmed up.
Skype. I said send me your Skype.
"Are you here to kill the idea of normal Presidential elections?
You are a disgrace to your profession dressed like that and wearing Crocs with socks.
Is that you, Charlie Brown?
Looks like we've both been hoodwinked this Halloween.
They said forty minutes or less or the pizza is free.
What, ran out of clown outfits did they?
Okay if I have to guess, I'd say you either wandered too far from the farm or you're the millennial reaper.
Trick or Treat?
Why don't we ever meet at my place?
Just letting everyone know. I'll be running unopposed in the 2020 Presidential election.
I'm rethinking my commitment to the Aitbnb thing.
You lied. And you're late.
No, we don't have a pencil sharpener.
Shaggy and Scooby aren't ready yet.
Would it kill you to call? Your dinner is on the table, it's cold.
You're wearing THAT??
Sorry, I ate all the candy watching the debates.
Ditch the hoodie.
You are too late, my husband, Bill, died last week!
Whatever it is, we're not buying!
Huh. It must be casual Friday.
Can you cut a rug?
He just left to catch a flight to Samarra.
You mean if your parents voted early, it's okay for you to trick-or-treat early?
Sorry, I'm already late.
You're not a clown, I'm not scared.
Death, in the gig economy.
Afraid to show your face for your candidate?
I was expecting you an hour ago, what kind of customer service is this?
Trick or what? - Halloween isn't for 2 more weeks.
I don't care whether you 'rap' or 'reap,' this is a 'no hoodie' zone!
You don't scare me, I just saw creepy Bozo.
We have all the insurance we need, and let me add that your taste is atrocious.
Could I maybe interest you in some Thin Mints?
Dammit Neil, how many times do I have to tell you that tools go in the garage?
Sorry. He is at the gym.
Mr. Zimmerman is not home right now. And who may I say is calling?
So...is tip already included in the app, or what?
I do like the new look but think you want old lady Jones down the hall.
His profile did say, "Looking for my partner in crime."
Hey, chill. I used the doorbell this time.
What do you mean "They cured cancer"?
When you return, wipe your feet.
I totally slay
OK, you're grim.
Alright already, we'll buy a snowblower.
You're going out in a hoodie? Your funeral.
THAT's not a clown!
Casual Friday, really?
"Grim Rapper"? Aren't you a little early for Halloween?
You need more training yourself if you expect to catch any real runners.
Just let me sweat the details.
Sorry, it's just a house rule. No sweatpants allowed.
What don't you understand about every other weekend?
What do you mean it's Casual Friday?
Hoodie lives matter?
What do you mean, you're here to cut my corn stalks?
How did you recognize me?
Actually I'm too busy right now. Could you come back another time?
The tarot card reader said I had until 90, I'm not going anywhere until I get a refund!
You're pretty old for a freshman.
Tappa tappa tappa...Muss be da Grim Rappa
Yes, I do think I will be including the elliptical in his estate sale.
You seem a bit old for trick or treating this year. Time to retire your scythe.
He saw you coming. But if you hurry, with those shoes, you can catch him. And stand straight, take your hand out of your pocket and go back to the old hoodie. The new look isn't working.
And I suppose you went to kill 'Jake from State Farm' again??...
No telling what's going to be on the other side of that door.
I'm no good and young. Now what?
I gave at the office, my husband's dead
Do you have a shovel?
Not now, I just registered to vote today!
Grim Reaper???? Is that some kind of candy?
Great Halloween costume dear,but where is bag for candy?
You just missed him, he's out cultivating his organic began diet and then competing in an Iron Man Competition. Care for some beet juice while you wait ?
Make a sales pitch, this world isn’t looking so good.
I told you to dress casual because we ain't gonna need fancy clothes for where we're going.
Sorry, I already cancelled my Comcast.
You scythe the song begins, you speak and I hear violins, it's tragic!
Reggie, I've accepted the hoodie but now you've gone to far.
You were supposed to be here 2 hours ago.
He had an appointment in Samarra.
Why does everyone else get formal and I get casual? Is there a number I can call?
''I think your Killer Clown outfit will have a bigger impact this year."
I get it. You're "bad to the bone."
Sorry buddy! You're too late. I just gave at the office.
I was hoping hip-hop would die by now, like disco did, before becoming the death of me.
A scythe, huh. Couldn't you have thought of something less retro?
I'm surprised you didn't get arrested carrying that thing. People are very nervous these days.
I have a roach problem,
Would you mind keeping it down?
Death panels are soooooo 2008
Good morning, Ma’am! Lucifer Lawn Mowing @ your service…
No thanks, I already have one of those thingies.
I know that you are comfortable with the wardrobe, but if you still want to live under our roof, you will have to find a job that pays better.
Drop the hoody if you're coming inside
Sorry, they were out of Pizza Man costumes and it was this or The Donald
You can have my flip cell phone but not my VCR
You lack the countenance for the job -- be gone !
How dare you interrupt my bridge party!
Game night is Tuesday!
You can't scare me, Grim Rapper. I'm a liberal.
Tell the neighbors you are have converted to Amish, not that you are going to Alaska to hunt baby seals.
honestly, I'm tired of hearing Obamacare is bad for business
It's Blue Oyster Cult and I won't turn it down.
Haven't you heard? The Donald says death and taxes can now be avoided!
‘Sure, take your time. It’s Casual Friday.'
Try using your right hand.
George Zimmerman? He lives in the house across the street.
How's the Democrat voter registration drive going?
We haven't got our Halloween Candy ready yet!
You´re a couple of months early, and I think the costume´s too grim.
I do organic lawn care without added hormones, antibiotics, or gasoline.
When I want you to remove my husband, I will call you!!
Why, I’ll gladly contribute to reap prevention.
The lawnmower ran out of gas.
No scythes in the house!
Relax, I’m the good one. The other guy wants to grab your pussy.
When I said we should flirt more this was not what I had in mind.
I already have life insurance.
I'm certain too. Taxes is grounded for the weekend.
Considering it was the last thing I'd do, I should've checked the App Store reviews.
No, he's not home right now. He's performing at Old-chella.
You don't scare me. Grim Reapers don't wear white hoodies.
Oh, shoot! The costume made me think you were just a trick-or-treater.
I don't suppose you have my Blue Apron?
It's pronounced "scythe," and you're not bringing it into the apartment.
My final offer: Bernie will be back from the Rotary at 10:30, and as a "best costume" award, you can eat all the remaining Halloween candy while you're waiting.
So which political party do you represent?
Sorry, I do not make campaign contributions.
Are you kidding me?! He moved two months ago!
You should know, I don't kiss on the lips.
Dying on casual Friday offers no dignity for this event.
You look much thinner in your personal ad photo.
Sorry, Dave's not here.
You can't scare me into voting for a man who spray-tans his private parts.
You don't look old enough to be a Grim Reaper, but he'll be back in ten minutes
No thank you. We don't want any.
Sorry, we're running aabout 20 years late!
Task Rabbit hired you?
I might go along with it if the hoodie and the shoes were black.
Just give me the turtleneck, lady, and we don't have a problem.
Care for a game of ping pong first?
I said "Pickles!"
I've got a bone to pick with you.
I told you, I am not interested in buying bibles nor scythes.
Do they have ping pong and free snacks?
I don't agree. Black scythes don't matter.
I told him to wear a sweater when he left, so you don't have to rub it in my face.
Nanook, are you seriously going to go ice fishing with that thing?
I'm here for the casual sowing club
The sweats are so not grim, Sonny!
Well, I'll be Faulknered. It appears my past is never dead.
It might be a good idea to rethink your Halloween costume choice
Forget your keys?
I think we should schedule some Facetime.
Consumer feedback said the robe didn't help Death seem relatable.
A steady job, and you're still not ready to live of your own?
Oh yeah? Then show me some I.D.O.A....
Stiff at last?
Look, you can't scare me. I did NOT order the pizza.
I guess you need your exercise, but you could've at least showered.
My, that looks sharp. My husband will be back in an hour.
No thanks. I've changed my mind about the Groupon Boot Camp fitness session.
I told you that girl would be the death of you.
Wear your hearing aids! I said be Jack Reacher not the Grim Reaper.
Kol Nidre is TOMORROW night, you jerk.
Oh is it that time --Trick or treat? I'll take the treat!
You look like a Clown in that outfit!
What? Trick or treat already!
We don't allow hoodies in here and that's final!
What happened to your Cubs hoodie?
Waze did say it was the fastest route.
I mean, I do respect a sensible shoe.
What is this? Casual Friday?
You look like hot death.
Thank goodness you knocked before the election!
You left your "Do Not Resuscitate" sign in your cloak.
Will you leave if I just give you all of my Halloween candy?
How many times must I tell you, Donald Trump lives next door!
I'd say this is my lucky day, Grim Rapper.
If you want to do some reaping, try Central Park.
Don't tell me. Your father is drunk at the bar again.
I still want to know how you got in here because this building doesn't allow solicitors.
The Grim Rapper? Def Death? Cheeba Cropper? OK, who are you?
I didn't know it was casual Friday.
Who was she?
You killed that door knock.
No, Scooby and Shaggy aren't here. Try the Mystery Machine.
Sorry, Death moved to the other side of town.
I'm sorry we already have a landscaper. Try next door.
Would have killed you to dress like you listen to Sinatra?
You want Henry. He's out back.
Your shoes are a dead give away!
He's not home right now, but if you would like to have a seat...
I am all set with life insurance
You can come in if you take off that hoodie.
His campaign is across the street.
C'mon in, you're a whole lot better than Trump or Hillary.
What's up with casual Friday?
Can't we negotiate this deductible with your agency before you run off ?
You can get up in my grill all you want, but not tonight - I have book club.
You're no scythe for sore eyes.
We give regularly at the office.
Can I ax yaw a question?
Don't look so grim. I already paid my taxes.
I don’t care what day of the week it is—I won’t be seen going out with a slob.
Aren't you a little early for Halloween?
I'm sorry I cheated on you and if the roles were reversed, I would feel like hell too.
Don't worry - this time I'm coming as a tax collector.
White is he new black
Tractor break down ... or a little chilly on the south 40?
I don't care if it is casual Friday. If you had any self-respect, you wouldn't be seen dead in that.
That's OK. I'll meet him at the skate park.
You'll have to come back. He hit the hay about an hour ago and is dead to the world.
Honey, I think the wifi is going down again.
Gee, sorry lady. I'm not a trick-or-treater.
Come on in! You must be half dead from the cold!
I'm a supporter of the Second Amendment, but this is ridiculous!
He's in the shower. Would you like a cup of coffee while you wait?
Welcome to Scythe-Sharpening-for-the-Grim-Trade. May I ask who referred you?
You can't fool me--you don't look anything like Max von Sydow.
If you're trying to make this 'hip'.....epic fail.
You are a couple weeks early.
Fred, Daphne, Shaggy...come help me pull the mask of this ne'er-do-well.
What is this........a sythe joke?
Dressed for a cold day in hell. January 20, 2017
Bill and Ted aren't home.
What do you mean doctors are evil?
Right, you're cool now. That's what they all say.
Catfished again.
No, I don't need my wheat fields thrashed. I've gone gluten free.
Where's my pizza?
Where have you been, Donald
Anubis can't come out and play. He's been a bad dog.
I already voted by mail, but soon you will have more reasons to be grim.
Wait a second - you're not the prostitute I ordered....
No. I told you "This time, get the right 'size'".
Cute, but if you don't want to mow the lawn,just say so.
delivery.... for room 666?
It's about time you got that grass cut!
Just because I was wearing a hoodie, the cops profiled me!
Is that what you're wearing?
The zombie wheat reaping is NEXT Tuesday.
Where have you been? I guess the only certain thing is taxes.
A penny for your thoughts.
Do you think this will displace the Creepy Clown meme?
Death has come for me? Don't you mean Death has come for Milk Duds?
If you've finished with the wheat field, there's a bunch of clover that needs attention.
Liberal democracy can't come out to play right now.
Did you make an appointment?
Aren't you a bit old for trick or treating?
I told you about hoodies.
Sorry, not interested.
trick or treat give me candy or say good by
Coming on Fridays now, huh?
The casual look doesn't really hide your true intentions Bob.
IF YOU'RE WITH THE BLOOD MOBILE, I GAVE LAST WEEK.
Now we even have Hipster Death? It really is time for me to go.
Go home and tell your kids black licorice is as much a Halloween treat as chocolate !
Can you come back during business hours?
If you’re from TaskRabbit, I hope you brought an Allen wrench for the bookshelves.
Whatever, Trump has got the four horseman around the corner.
I think North Palm Beach would be a better fit for me.
Yeah, well the hoodie is a nice touch. But nobody uses sickles anymore. You might want to get a John Deere Harvester?
I just got this sensible haircut
I don't know the casual Friday look is trending. This is more grim rapper.
Sorry, I had requested the groundskeeper
The witch trial is next door.
You're a little late, he's on the campaign trail!
Isn't it a bit early for Halloween?
You mean to tell me tbat you didn't have time to get your cloak out of the dry cleaners?
I mean honestly, the Spirit of Christmas Future? It isn't even November.
Sorry, but my computer died last week.
How many times have I told you to make sure you have your keys before leaving the house?
You'll find him at the office working for the Trump campaign
I want full disclosure
That's NOT what Vanity Fair meant when they said to update traditional work clothes!
It's part of the new Ingmar Bergman Stand Your Ground Law.
No, I haven't deconstructed the meaning of Halloween!
You again? Just let me finish my coffee.
You need to put a little more effort into your costume
Your embarrassing wardrobe will be the death of me!
I told your father that you missed trimming the hedges last time
If you're looking for Sally, she's down the hall.
Print is not here. Better luck next time.
Are you the hedge trimmer?
To appear less intimidating, Grim donned the attire of a teenager. His mother was not impressed. She doesn't fear The Reaper.
Not now ... I just matched on tinder
You're early....my Harry is still in hospice.
I can't wait to tell my friends about your Website. Harold's in the TV room.
Winthrop, take off that ridiculous hoodie.
Fred? Daphne? Shaggy? I think another clue just showed up the door!
I thought you were going as Shaggy?
But if I went for a jog right now, I would have a heart-attack!
So, you're Grim's dim reaper in the 'hood.
You're early, trick or treat isn't until the 31st.
I told you to wear something warmer.
I imagine you charge by the hour too.
I'm not very happy about the way you cut the grass last week, please see if you can get it shorter today.
You're late! He has been telling me over and over how he doesn't have to follow that diet.
In my day, we used to shovel snow for pocket money!
"I guess I'm late!
Mr. Trump has been awaiting you
Go away, Halloween is not for another two weeks and one day
You're reapulsive.
I still think you should have taken the tele-marketing gig.
My husband already gave at the office.
So much for all those TGIFs!
For God's sake, you guys aren't even dressing up anymore?
You're early! Wouldn't he open the door?
We're Christians; we don't do Halloween. Go next-door.
A golden retriever, huh? Well, in case I see him, what's your address?
Try using a rake.
Dr. Denton of Death, I presume?
Death-you are not proud.
You don't look grim just stupid in that outfit. Get lost, loser.
How about he wins the last game?
Welcome home, son
You're too young looking for this job, just like my doctor.
Hi, Ma'am! Is your husband home?
You're late! You're not going dressed like that!
He just left to pay his taxes.
Wipe your feet if you've been hanging out down by the Styx.
You might not be to young for Death, But i am too young to die.
It's not Casual Friday -- you can just go home and change into proper business attire!
You are a little early for Halloween.
I'm just going to stand my ground.
You'll have to come back later; I'm not caught up on all my email.
A feeling of dread crept over Marcy, as though she were somehow already behind on her Christmas shopping.
"Your father already made a pickup yesterday".
I hope that thing is sharp, I have lots of pruning that needs to be done.
Not quite the Axe Effect I was hoping for
I don't care that you're freaking out the neighbor kids. Get back out there and finish harvesting our wheat!
Don't worry, I'm just here for the book club.
Nice try—but Halloween was last week.
Tell me when you audition for a Tim Burton film, OK?
I'm G.Reaper , I called about your rental .
I know you're in there.
When you open the door and karma comes a knockin
I'm not paying in advance; you haven't even planted the daisies.
Come back tomorrow I have one more sweater to knit
Sorry Grim, I don't think I'll be able to fit dying into my schedule today.
I'm not sure that the retirement home will appreciate your particular brand of irony.
[Leave This Space Blank To Drive Readers Crazy]
Wrong address. George Zimmerman lives next door.
I hare Casual Diedays!
Well, I am impressed! The shoes, the scythe, the pocket pool -- a true cross trainer. Anyway, the cable guy already left.
I'm so sorry. I just bought some cookies.
Don't you think you're a bit old to be abusing Casual Friday privileges?
I'm all out of goodies will cash be ok?
Sorry, St. Peter mowed the lawn yesterday.
Was the store all out of Ken Bone costumes?
I have been waiting for 39 years, Jerry.
Yes I know what candidate he supports, but you'll have to come back he actually went to the debate.
Does it come in any other color?
Dad, I've told you a million times, I don't like popsicles!
Poindexter, you're slouching again.
Can we wait until the election?
What gave you away?
Nice Harold, but it's Halloween not New Years!
The mugger look is your idea of blending in, is it?
I'm here asking for your vote.
You just missed him, he went to get ice cream with Thanatos.
Oh yeah? Well, my idea of a great poem is "Death Be Not Schlumperdik."
NO No My husband mows the yard.
Death be not proud...
Sorry, not today, your workouts will kill me...
Glad your here. Might be hard to pry out of Donald's hands, but the campaign is definitely dead.
Your hoodie may give people the wrong impression.
Sorry, no uninvited guests.please.
I told you not to drink and drive.
Sorry Trayvon, Zimmerman doesn't live here.
Well that's just too bad for you! You reap what you sow.
I'm not letting him go with you until you put on a proper cloak and show some damned respect.
You just missed him, if you run you can catch him
Mr. Trump, Halloween isn't for two more weeks.
I think I left my robe at your place.
Guess I shouldn't have watched the second Presidential Debate afterall.
I don't care if it's Casual Friday. I'm not going out with you dressed like that!
Do you want candy or cookies for you Halloween basket?
Tinder said that you like hoodies , has a passive personality , and constantly contacts famous people?
I'm not going anywhere with you until you finish shoveling the snow off my sidewalk.
No, I don't have a spare iPhone charger.
Your ‘’Uber economy’ tale of woe notwithstanding, ‘Kyle’, I think I get to be just a little more disappointed here.
Grim? Wait 'til you see your father...
Why don't you usu the damned weed wacker instead?
What happened in Vegas, stays in Vegas.
This is not what I meant when I told you I wanted a casual relationship and that scythe matters!
And all this time, I thought it was Life that was like a marathon.
He wanted to extend his apologies for pullin' you away from your workout!
I'm thinking of extending your curfew.
Let me guess, Fred the Reaper.
You are not 20 anymore death, its time for you to move out.
I think you're overdressed for scything.
I was hoping I could borrow your scythe sharpener.
Trick or treat? Vacectomy anyone?
Picky, picky... You're still late for dinner.
I expected you after the first debate, but now is as good as any as I don't think I can watch the third.....We're all doomed anyway.
What, he's sending a Taskrabbit now?
You're the first one to the party. Do you mind waiting outside the door till the others show up?
Halloween isn't till next week!
You're late. Ha Ha! get it? Late? Death? Late? Ha Ha Ha... OK, it wasn't THAT funny, so whaddya gonna do, kill me?
Well, I don't think your my dead ringer at all!
I may have fibromyalgia, sleep apnea, and chronic post-nasal drip, but otherwise I've still got a heap o' livin' to do, pal!
Too late, I gave at the office
Trick or treat? Some choice!
Don't fear me, ma'am. I'm with Blue Oyster Cult.
As a woman who lives in suburban Philadelphia, t will take more than a veiled threat to get my vote
The sharing economy may have gone too far. I can't tell if you're here to claim a soul, or harvest wheat.
Checks in the mail.
no I won't vote for Donald Trump
You're past curfew, mister.
'I ordered pizza.' 'That's right. You did.'
MY number's up? Nonsense. Now you go right back to the Carnegie Deli and apologize.
No, I won't be interested in a subscription!
Sorry, Halloween is still 4 weeks away.
You're here to reap the snow?
Oh, it's you. I thought you would be someone else. Hmmmm, is it alright if you take me after the Pizza man comes?
Why the long face?
You must be from the Geek Squad.
No, I already have one that's just sitting on the shelf collecting dust.
Can we count on your support in the upcoming election? Together, we can make America great again.
The Boss says I can dress casually on Friday.
I'm sorry; I get all my news online.
I know you're an imposter. The real dude wears Nikes.
Of all the unexpected pop ins!
So I'm not wearing the robe. Quit death shaming!
Criminy, you would have to show up on a casual Friday!
For the last time, keep up with your laundry.
I can identify that knock from anywhere.
I'm here to slash your taxes." "Thanks, but I'm still not going to vote for you.
He just flew out of here like a bat out of hell!
Do you even think i believe you got stuck in traffic?
Sickle and cythe association is one floor up
Sorry, wrong address. I'm vegan.
Sorry, he just left for Samarra
Take some candies. But I am not buying that you can also mow for $20.
It's Friday ... Casual Day.
Oh yeah, you blend.
Sorry, wrong house. You're next week.
Meh--the alt-right trolls just now were scarier.
Come back when you have a warrant, comrade.
You know, you might have a bigger effect that you planned.
So, "Dress for the job you want, not the job you have" is pointless in your line of work.
Darn it. Catfished again!
No, I didn't order it. You want the sixth seal next door.
I'm glad your Brooklyn based, hipster lanscaping business is doing well but that doesn't change things, we're through.
An ironic Halloween costume. You're over-thinking the holiday, son.
Good afternoon ma'am, do you have a moment to discuss the decline in the scythe trade?
Not even this can save you, Donald.
As soon as I'm there I'll be telling your Gramps about this.
Mr. Peterson, as I told your wife, I've no need for a human weed whacker.
By the way, thanks for dressing for the occasion...
Going 'green' on the weeds again?
Are you the gentleman caller? Well, well, there's no body here.
I thought the whole door-to-door thing died out a long time ago.
No good, with that sweat suit your grim is not showing.
Nice Halloween disguise, but the scythe's a dead giveaway!
Hey, it's your Uber Moment of Reckoning, am finally here.
I just saw the news. I told you HANNAH Walters, not Anna.
You are late! Couldn't you dress up a little?
Yes, I heard on Nextdoor that you were around.
Blue Bell. Why?
Yeah, the crispy creases in your sweatsuit tell me I'm not going anywhere, son.
I know, but everyone who is not a guest comes to the back door.
I've already told you: YES, we voted!
Take a deep breath - you're in a safe space.
Sorry, I don't play chess.
You want to borrow a lacrosse stick?
Do you have time today to meet our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ?
Okay, enough of the Crossfit.
If you're here for the desktop, too late.
That work out routine you're on will add years to your life.
If you're going to wear a hoodie, you need to update the dance.
My cooking may be bad but it's not THAT bad.
You're late getting home. I'm glad you got a head start!
If you're the ghost of Halloween Future, tell me which neighborhood kid is going to egg my house next year.
Honey, don't you think you're too old to to do this?
How Liberals see the racist Grim Reaper.
Sorry to reschedule but the doctor said Grandma isn't due until Monday.
Sorry, George isn't home yet.
No matter who wins the election, I may be ready for you.
So you're Lulu Lemon.
Are you sure you can hack my daughter's emails?
Are you going to come in?
The true story: "I'm afraid he's out, running an ultra-marathon in Samara."
I'm sun safe, no carbon footprint, front and back. 20 bucks.
Not wearing this season's 'new black"?
Robert Frost? Oh, he's in the other room. Hold on, I'll get him.
You're late again! You're father is never late.
Sorry, we already have a lawn service.
I told you before, he left saying he was going to hitchhike to someplace called Perdition
Really? How do you expect people to take you seriously as a Trump Election Observer looking like that?
You're supposed to be grim .....not, glum!
Where have you been? Your dad's been gone for two years.
"I'm Georgia Zimmerman".
I was hoping you would have already killed the athleisure trend.
Maybe they think you're just too laid back
Really, why do you feel like you have to pick on me?
I didn't say Netflix and kill!
This Halloween will get you all treats and no tricks.
I'm still not paying you that $20.
Ma'am, Do you have a second to talk about jehovah witness and it's great followers?
You lost the debate again?
There must be a mistake. I entered The "Readers" Digest Sweepstakes. With a "d" ! ! !
Isn't this taking the gig economy just a bit too far?
Oh ... So NOW, you are willing to open up?
Where's the pizza? The review said it was killer!
Can I charge this 'hit' to a credit card?
I wasn't expecting you on the same day that I get audited by the IRS.
I said to come back in two weeks.
A trip to the boneyard? Sounds cool.
It looks okay overall, except for those sneakers.
No . . . I advertised for a leaf PEEPER.
If you really think this is a good excuse for you ghosting me the last month, think again.
What's up....... Bitch!???
I have NEVER been a fan of casual Fridays.
Well come on in. We just made the punch!
BOO to you too,Harold.
Not scary, put on your politico suit.
It could be any combination of things
*Looks at watch* "Seriously?"
And you must be The Grim Hipster.
you've changed
Enough with being an unpaid intern, why don't you try junior college?
No I don't want a subscription to "Death Weekly."
Look, you called *me.*
Casual Friday is going to be the death of me!
Is that Chinese or American steel?
That's not scary... That's embarrassing.
Thank you, but my husband has done his man-scaping for the month. Do you have a card?
No, you're not quite what I expected either. How do you feel about children?
Casual Friday on a Tuesday? I'm sorry but you'll have to wait three more days.
You missed him. You'll have to come back later.
I'd prefer to stand my ground.
Sneakers and a hoodie is not a good look for you.
It's election night.
No George, I said, "I want to see the film Sleeper."
Halloween, All Saints, or All Souls?
I don't think that outfit cuts it.
I get that it's a new look, but I'm not sure people are going to go along with it.
Do you really think you can get the squirrel out of my attic with that thing?
Come back tomorrow with your old-school hood and maybe then I'll take you seriously.
You have thirty minutes to come back with the double-bacon jalapeno cheddar burger that I ordered - make it sharp.
You look ridiculous, Charles. Just get the John Deere and cut the grass already.
Hello, I'm Elder Grim, have you heard of Joseph Smith?
You want to do what again?
Okay, you'll get a treat after you finish cutting the grass!
It's a little late in the year for Summer casual.
Did you finish him in the hay stack?
She's almost finished putting the zombie makeup on the Trump mask.
You know I don't like hoodies, especially wearing them to work.
No, thank you. But I'd be in for a pick-up game of B-ball!
You arrive in sweats, and sneakers for the big day? The weeds are out back!
Hello ma'am. I am selling magazine subscriptions to pay my way through medical school.
Oh, and I almost forgot, I'm spending it all before you get a penny from your silly tax!
You look like hell... uh oh!
Harry, why can't you just disenfranchise Democrats like a normal Republican legislator.
You're late, where are your robes? I was worried to death about you!
I think you heard wrong. Grim Reeboks don't cut it.
How dare you show your face again after taking my beloved husband only three months ago!
Wait right here. I'll go and get civility for you.
Huh, I just died.
Sorry pal, I just talked to Jack the Ripper. Not going for his program either, now git !!!!
After all this waiting, you finally show up ... and you're dressed like *that*?
Okay, you've got the grim part down pat, but Mr. Trump we both know you're no reaper.
Sorry, you’re too late, I already sent my husband your way.
What do I MEAN he's gone?
Looking good, Slim Reaper.
But it isn't Halloween yet!
Oh, no. My goodness. I thought you would be so much more impressive.
Well, well, well -- looks like death cometh late.
You flew in all the way from Silicon Valley to claim my desk top?
You just missed him. He's gone to Samarra.
I am here to trim your shrubs.
But Halloween was last night.
I'm pretty evolved. A hoodie doesn't scare me.
What is this, gym class? Come back when you're better dressed!
You could of at least dressed in black.
What? You don't take off your hood when you come in?
Oh! So you're the guy @R33P3R that started following me on Twitter.
If you think I'm gonna accept only $25 for cutting your lawn, you've got another thing coming to you!
Well, I did want it to be quick.
That's special that Mr. Trump wanted you to come like that to the next debate.
Sorry, not just just now. How about cleaning our rain gutters?
I'm not going to say it again.....there are no refunds!
Why would i call the grim reaper for a little landscaping job.
Oh let me guess, the slim slacker!
Not now! You were supposed to be here an hour ago.
Are you looking for the grim sleeper?
That's a grim looking Halloween costume!
Go to your doom!
There you go again--separating the wheat from the chaff.
I am ready to start the yard work
I don’t think about death that often, but when I do, I know it’s going to be some weird way. I’m probably going to die, like from the hiccups or tripping on air. Please try again later.
The Clinton ground game is amazing.
You don't have to impress me with your street cred, but, yeah, robes are such overkill.
Maggie Spencer, why couldn't you at least answer any of my texts?
You're Lucky you didn't get pulled over !!!
donald trump
Wassup, brah.
You had your chance 20 years ago, when I stayed home from the prom and you stood me up.
But you were supposed to be wearing a clown mask
Ya know, my husband was a hedge fund manager when he was alive.
We slice our own bananas.
That "locker room" bus is taking us all down!
Boy, that last hill took a lot out of you.
This is NOT a funny happy-birthday-o-gram!
I see you've picked up on the athleisure trend.
So..how was practice ?  So...how was practice ?
Let me guess ... ghost of the Grim Reaper?
I don't think it's no big deal.
You look fetching in street wear .
Isn't a sweatsuit a little warm for where you are going?
Change your clothes into something more appropriate and then we can talk.
I will have none of that attitude in my house, young man!
Hi. Is your husband home?
I hope that suit's not asbestos.
Good! You came to mow the lawn?
I told you, I'm not interested in your 'Hint of Death' perfume.
Oh dear Grim Reaper !, you scare me less than a Republican without a scythe.
How kind of you to stop by.
Aren't you supposed to be chilling, not chill?
Weren't you a member of Blue Oyster Cult back in the seventies?
No. Wrong address. The "Candidate" lives next door.
We won't need the lawn scythed until next spring.
Good evening, do I have the right apartment for the urban gardeners meetup?
Iif you would just change your outfit once in a while, maybe you could be more persuasive.
Google sent you?
You'll never make a living wage!
Shouldn't you be in Haiti?
Before you get started, we already have handyman who takes care of all the weeds around here.
Mark Zuckerberg... Are you unfriending me?
Yes, you are famous. No you are not a star. And ..no you can't so don't even think it.
Phil this has got to stop! I've told you, i'm doing yoga in the mornings now. Stop with the Gym Reaper visits, and get over it.
While I appreciate that your costume is a pun on an Arthur Miller play, you are way too old to be trick-or-treating.
No, you're not getting paid until you finish deadheading those geraniums in the garden.
I thought you already uploaded all the data you need?
I like your hoodie.
Sorry, no candy. Sugar is a killer.
So tell me about your holiday
Don't you go telling me 'It's a race to the death' and the winner gets a makeover!'
What's with the ten cent reaper? You're going to need a combine to take me down.
No, calling it the Silicon Valley of Death doesn't make it sound more appealing!
I'm afraid what you have is contagious.
'Death of Slackers'? Boy, have you come to the wrong place.
Wait, you're telling me you're not here to cut the hedges, the hedges already fell on me?
Are you absolutely sure you can't wait until Election Day?
No hoodies are allowed in this house, mister!
Wrong condo they moved months ago!
Hey there, big boy.
There may be some lingering resentment.
Wearing a hoodie will make the cops worry that you have a concealed weapon
You can come in but you'll need to park your cycle outside.
I sent my 1040 by mail.
Really, Fred, a hoodie and sickle? Am I to guess, you're either taking me to an old folks home or a hamburger joint for dinner? Right?
No, my garden is not dying.
Hey mom, I've decided what my second Ph. D is going to be in.
I thought you were bringing a friend for dinner
YOU HEARD ME, ONE MORE STEP AND I WILL PUT THAT SCYTHE WHERE THE SUN DON'T SHINE !
I'm sorry, but you'll have to come back later.
Halloween isn't for two more weeks
It's official, you're empty inside.
Meanwhile, somewhere in Latvia: What did I tell you about scything after dark?
You're late again.
Why don't you take that scythe and run it up your ass.
'I'm not going anywhere with a franchisee'
ken bone lol
Oh good, I was thinking about the Trump and the election which made me yearn for the sweet release of Death...
you know....your 'Casual Friday' attiew is not making this any easier.
No, the creepy clown with orange hair is the guy hiding behind the hedges...not the one you see on the television set.
Hey, I can smell your face. (Clement, age 5)
No, No! I told you, I wanted you Sight Unseen!
My robe is still at the die cleaners
You traded your bike for THAT?
Black sickle!? I told you to take your brown one so it matched my shoes!
Shouldn't you be carrying a harpoon?
He is not here, he is late.
For the last time, no, I will not pay you by the hour to cut my lawn.
Millennials may be passé, but I don't think they're dead.
You're not here for trick or treat, are you?
Did the ghosts just win the pennant?
I'm being let go? I know they are closing a lot of stores but couldn't you just text me.
You're a week ealrly. Halloween is next week.
Never heard of the saying, "the shoes maketh the man" I guess.
I see my deadbeat son has run out of money again.
I'm sorry, The Trim Reaper is not a sneaker company I want to invest in.
No soliciting, please.
It looks a little too big for my sharpener.
I know we had a date, but I'm not ready. Kindly stop knocking.
Aren't we getting a bit too casual about our dress, Mr. Reaper?
The fashion police has gotten a bit out of control, wouldn't you say?

Harold, I warned you about wanting to be a salesman.
So they finally sent a gardener who is willing to tackle the Deadly Nightshade.
You're here for MY wardrobe? Really?
I got stuck in traffic.
When you were so late I knew it would be one of the substitutes.
Can you come back when it's not a Casual Friday?
Shouldn't you be looking in basements?

You couldn't have waited til after Casual Friday?
Your dad is not feeling well?
Well, if it isn’t Mr., I’m Late as Usual, Millennial Grim Reaper. I said to him, ‘You look like death warmed over.’ He said, ‘Naw, just something I ate.’ He’s in the living room, if you have time to spare.
Sorry I am late, the laundromat was murder.
He's running late. He had an appointment in Samarra with your dad.

He's out for a jog right now. He'll be back in 12 years.
Sorry, my uniform goes on back order this time of year.
Hey Grim, that hoodie is not a good look for you. Why not try a nice baseball cap?
Please explain Scooby-Doo the movie.
What? Am I supposed to leave my labor, and my leisure too, for your casualness?
I am sorry, you have the wrong address
Grim Reaper; you're too late. He died yesterday.
So I should make the check payable to "Deadheads for Donald?"
Casual Friday? Get a life.
Your a week to late.
I guess that's why you're here - I'm old enough to remember when casual Friday didn't mean sweatpants and sneakers.
Again? You're going to run him to death.
sorry,but we gave at the office
So, is casual in, Grim Reaper ?
What do you want me to say...you don't become me!

I told you that hoddie was a disaster waiting to happen.
OK. Remind me to die on a casual Friday. Oh!
No 'trick' here. That's the fop next door.
Don't worry...you're safe now
Come back on Casual Friday.
What took so long? You said 30 minutes or less for scythe sharpening.
Sorry, we don't need our grass to be cut during the winter.
Sorry Marvin, I'm not buying that you are really the Grim Reaper--the Nike running shoes gave you away.
I see you have the soul patch, how about a bearded soul?
C'mon, Death. Not today. Not on Casual Scythe Day.
Please leave me alone! I'm not interested in donating to your university
It's a little early for trick or treat, isn't it?
Sorry, he isn't here. He gave at the office.
I hate casual Friday's.
I don't care if it's the latest street fashion.
I love your costume, but Halloween is October 31st.
Donald Trump, The Grim Reaper....how apropos.....would you like a coffee....or a maid?

They're called "Dad Shoes."
'Grim Reaper' in a Hoodie? Fancy That!
It's about time, my jerk of a husband is watching football in the living room.
No sir. My daughter does not go on a date with death if he doesn't even have the decency to dress up a bit.
I would rather not join 'Gardeners Anonymous' today.
We'd love to support your high school trip, but we're really not in the market for farm tools.
Sorry mom, but it apparently isn't a recession proof industry, and I need a place to crash.
I know WE'RE taking death much too casually these days, but c'mon, you..................?
Wait a minute, my pre-arrangement was supposed to be better than this!
She is home, but doesn't feel like seeing You.
No, I don't even have your app. Try the guy in 3B.
I know I'm no Michelle Obama, but Trump begged me to be his surrogate until the end of the campaign.
Hold a minute. I'll throw my dog under the bus.
Your online profile said you are "businesslike" -- not an unemployed slacker that lives in his mom's basement.
Understated casual, no. From grim to bleak, yes.
No, I don't like those shoes.
Are you really going out like that?
Get your hand out of your pocket before you enter this house.
Sorry you can't blame climate change for looking like death warmed over.

Jack the Reaper at your service. I mow your lawn to death.
You sew what you reap?
He's out in the hood.
Someday, and that day may never come....I'll call upon you to do a service.
And how was the Halloween Party?
Grim Reaper or Grim Mugger?
What do you mean you're out of thin mints?!
I don't care if he has your endorsement. More jobs like yours we don't need.
For the money or for the people?
I said ANT infestation, not AUNT.
It seems you forgot the date for Halloween.
Don"t tell me that you haven't heard of global warming...
Trick and treat may be the big choices, but it's a third-option year!
Frankly my dear, I am worried about all the candy I ate.
You're invading my space
Isn't this a little early for trick and treating?
Nice costume, but farmer Brown is upset-he thinks you also stole some of his pumpkins.
Yes, I realize your name is Donald. Mine is certainly not Hillary.
No, but I AM highly skilled at Pokemon Go
Thankfully your father died last month.
The doctor will be right in with your certificate of suppository.
THIS is how you escape profiling?
Honestly George, why don't you become a witch instead!
It's totally normal to feel like you're going to crack.
Sorry, I don't go out with younger men!
Dressing like Luke Cage will not make your job more fun.
Do you mean I'm sick sick or you're digging my groovy outfit?
He's in the garageIs this is the fist time you have ever been on time?
My husband insisted that either we get him a riding lawnmower, or we hire a professional.
Whered you get the new yeezies???

I was just moving on with life after you.

african american? that would be apartment 23
You're holding a "s word". Swearing or stabbing isn't acceptable behavior.
Jimmy. You don't have to bring your own knife to dinner?
Trayvon, eventually your mission will be ironic.
I don't care you are! I'm not going to tell you who I voted for!
I'm sorry, but the sewing club meeting is tomorrow.
Well how am I to know your robe's dirty if you don't tell me?
What do you mean, you don’t play chess, what about Pokemon?
56 years old and YOU are my first and, obviously, last virgin?

You're not Seamless.
I hope you remembered to put on deodorant this time.
No, I'm not giving a treat to a Woody Allen character.
Okay, so you're related to him, but what exactly is a grin reaper?
Dear, I know the kid in you comes out on Halloween, but dinner is ready.
You can't turn me off, I already made a payment...
Sorry, they changed the password again
Hey Grim, didn't they have a Scythe with a white handle? Think it's a better daytime look with that hoodie.
It works for Trick or Treating, but it takes more than a hoodie and a beat-up scythe to create a convincing Grim Reaper.
Are you a Trick or a Treater ?
Call that reaping your hood?
I've got no candy for you.
You are way too old to be treat or treAting!
Hello Mrs. Malfoy. Can Draco come out to play?
No, no, they make sure I'm as comfortable as possible.
How kind of you to stop by--I have been hearing a lot of buzzing flies. Not sure the scythe will help.
No wonder all of your profile pics we're from the waist up.
I warned you not to put your dark colored sweats in with the bleached whites.
You look absolutely lousy, Kermit. I think you're taking this artisanal farming thing way too far.
well i'd rather you come to collect my soul instead of the government collecting my taxes.
You came for Rex, correct? What took so long?
You're not fooling me with that Ed McMann malarkey.

You missed curfew...
So you ditched your robe and your disguised as a stereotypical american so trump doesn't know think muslim
No matter how ill prepared you are for this, I can guarantee my husband is not going to like this.
Can't you see that we've already got double glazing?!
I ordered Pizza from Dominics!
I'm going to slay this date.
Let me get this straight, barbecue pork sausage, fried cheese chips, bacon wrapped potatoes, and two months is allI have to wait?
He's almost ready, are you sure this is such a good idea going to the Pumpkin Patch?
You shoveled my driveway with that?
We call that a Trump-thump.
Tom Brady's not here.
Seriously? Come back any day but a Friday.
Well, to tell you the truth, it is a bit dated. Next time, try a big red nose, some floppy shoes and a can of silly string - and then maybe you will get the response you are looking for.
That field is too overgrown for running.
Wrong apartment. And I think 'Seamless for scythes' is a stupid idea for a startup.
Look, is Zimmerman here or not?
Please come back after dinner.
He said, "hello hello hello". She said, "here we are now, entertain us". He said, "I'm a mulatto, an albino". She said, "smells like teen spirit".
'I would rather go with you than vote for Trump, unless we're going to Arby's - leave me here if we're going to Arby's.
Before I allow you into my living room, could you show me your "scythe salesman" identification?
You missed him again. Do you not understand what it means to have an appointment?
Thanks for coming. I told the lady at the garden store that those pesticide sicks weren’t working.
Your late! I emailed you two days to come and get him after I put something in his drink.
I don't have any Saccharin or menthol cigarettes. I have gummy bears.
I told him not to order anymore takeout...
Sorry I didn't recognize you right away. I always thought you were taller, skinnier and wore black. Anyway, come on in. I need to freshen up and get my bag. Would you like a drink while you wait?
"Oh! He'll need a moment; he's voting absentee.
You've been out with your friends dexting again, haven't you?
Oh! I forgot to buy candy
Come back when you can behave a little less like Donald Trump.
You lost your face shaving?
Didn't your folks ever teach you never to wear hoodie attire when paying a social call?
Our beautiful garden didn't happen on its own. We used a lawn mower for a helping hand.
Stay calm! Your heart beat is normal!
a little early for halloween, aren't you?!
A Grim Reaper in sneakers and a hoodie is in the wrong Pratchett novel.
Sure I'm dead but even in death I can be depicted as a nagging harpy chastising cool, fun men for declining standards in formal wear.
No! I don't need my weeds whacked, a new roof, my windows washed or my dog walked! Go away!
Not for nothing, Casual Friday is no substitute for a true holiday.
Hey man, he's gone. Took his Harley to Samarra.
No, Kenny, you aren't invited to the funeral! And neither is your aardvark!
I'm just not sure you're qualified for the job.
Yeah, I heard Donald Trump's window of opportunity lives here.
The kids are nit scared of me anymore
Well, it's about time. Donald Trump has been causing a ruckus with his presidential campaign since June 2015!
Thou art slave to fashion.
... and no doubt a casual tee.
Hi, Grim. I wasn't expecting you today.
Yes I get your point but still, I'm not giving up my country music!
Yes, we're watching the debate, why do you ask? Did you run here?
Is this your idea of a Halloween custom?
I'm not impressed by your time keeping or attire!
Psycho-Snow-Shoveler isn't near as frightening. Go back to the clown thing.
Quinoa is a lot more hands-on than spelt.
I clearly live in an apartment; therefore I do not clear you to provide your wood-clearing log services to me.
Billy, you're not funny. Take off that costume.
If you walked here from Hell it must be Times Square.
So, it's $5 per soul and a 'buy one, get one free' sale, right?
I can tell you lost wheat cutting again.
How many holidays does your dad TAKE?
I only opened the door because I didn't want to look prejudice.
You're mistaken. Sally, next door, is making salmon mousse for the pitch-in. I'm Waldorf Salad.
Didn’t you read the “No Advertising Please” sign at the door?
"It's 6:30. The woman on the phone said sometime between 8 A.M. and 5 P.M. I think I'll just switch to Fios".
You Reap-Lite reps sure are impatient. The answer's still no.
Mr. Kasparov has no desire to play hoops.

I am not scared of you. You look hideous.
The time has come? Where's your black cloak? And, what about that pale horse?
SHOW ME UR DICK BRO
Really, this new hoodie outfit doesn't make you anymore welcome.
Before you say anything, I'm not here for your soul. Just your soles, now hand over the shoes.
You're early—come back in the Spring.
I thought health goth was finally dead.
Well frankly, I had requested a Housekeeper- but I suppose if you put down your scythe...
Billy? Just missed him, off for another round of tightrope Pokémon.
I certainly hope you didn't think this would get you out of paying your library fines.
Wait! For trick or treat you want my vote?
I'll let you in but knock this time.
Nah! The Dutch are still way more casual about it.
Who told you updating your attire would be cool? Was it SATAN?
Sorry. You're too late. The job's been taken. been taken.
"Grim Reaper...casual Friday" ! That is an oxymoron.
Your dad was to busy for my parakeet?
The cable guy will be here any minute. Been dying to get it done. The real dying can wait right?
No, we don't follow #bakedNhoodiedReaper; I tell you my husband is not here.
Neato! You can hang the scythe over your wagon wheel coffee table.
Would you believe,......"Avon calling"?
Sorry, I already donated mine to the Salvation Army.
You can't be serious. Look at you! Clean yourself up and maybe we can have an earnest discussion when you return. I never........hmpf.
Sorry Death, I don´t have any candy for you.
You don't look anything like your modern representation.
Lose the hoodie.
Honey... It's the "grin weeper"! Perfect for Halloween or the election!
Your appointment for your in-home personal pedicure was expedited to this afternoon.
Aren't you a little under dressed and over qualified for the Stylist's job?
Very funny, Mr. Zimmerman.
Father Time, could you stay home and relax today? I feel like you're always running...
NOT TODAY, SATAN
Frankly, this is one area where I didn't want the gig economy to reach.
Hey, my profile never specified I looked like the Clark Gable of the past...
No, my grass doesn't need cut, but you can mulch the gardens.
You're not even making an effort—treat now like it's a workout
Grim up!
That's not what I ordered!
No, I'm sorry but your 'bro' isn't here at the moment.
How about I just pop a cap in your ass!
Alright, alright. I'll put down the potato chips. They can't be that bad for you!
Let me guess,You like mustard on your french fries
No, Trump? Never...
As Grim Reapers go, black's more trendy...the cosplay party's next door.
All the other neighborhood kids have beenhere already; so I have no more candy and nothing else to offer you.
Very funny, Bill. Now go back to the Patriots practice facility where you belong.
Oh no! I ordered the small one
You're supposed to be my knight in shining armor.
The Boss called! Your Quota Has Been Slashed!
I laugh at death in sans-a-belts
So, where do you think you are heading off to?!
Hello, "hay cutters" need to report to the farm.
Why are you wearing sneakers?! Funerals are formal occasions!
Since when was death gauche?
Have you found the Lord yet Miss? If not, I can introduce you.
No worries, I have eight more lives.
And exactly what are you....the Eskimo Reaper?
Trick or treat! I would appreciate your vote for Donald Trump!
Let’s see how he claims to be “smart” by avoiding you.
I'm still not interested in a subscription of Reaper Monthly.
Why are you here early? Our date isn't until four.
Jeremy always takes the easy way down.
Oh, no, those were just false smears.
Ghost of pizza past? You just missed him.
"The grim reaper" is not my idea of an acceptable Halloween costume.
'You bring your rubber gloves?"
You really should go digital.
I prefer a more formal Grim Reaper.
You will give birth to twin cases of jewelry
I don't care if you're here for Halloween, Day of the Dead, or to take me to meet my maker. I'm too busy to go with you right now. Come back in a month. Or maybe even longer.
You have to go to Hooters for "work"...on a Sunday?
