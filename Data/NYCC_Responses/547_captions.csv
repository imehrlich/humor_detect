You're right. No underwear.
Like the pomp. Not crazy about the circumstances.
Okay, our pomp is good. Now let's work on our circumstance.
We're not the only ones that could use a shave.
Could really use some rain on this parade.
You see her, too, right?
Another mile and it's my turn to wear the outfit.
She's a tough act to follow.
Should we just go around her?
Trump said he knows more than the majorettes.
I wish it would rain on our parade.
Can we unfollow her?
Personally, I could use a little less pomp and better circumstances.
Just be glad we're not following the elephants.
We'd be lost without her.
Think she's into a mirage a trois?
Maybe the rest of the band was right.
She'd better be worth it.
Following the Pied Piper, or even Moses to the Promised Land, is understandable, but THIS ???
Mirage a trois.
"Who doesn't love a parade?" you said...
This is my first mirage à trois, too.
At least she got us off the desert island cartoon.
Do you think she'd go for a mirage a trois?
At least we're not following the horses.
I don't think she remembers where we parked either.
Believe me, her finale is worth it!
God, I hate away games.
I still can't see up her skirt.
ENOUGH ALREADY with your 'hup,2,3,4 hup,2,3,4 ...'
I'm thinking about quitting the band.
Sure it's a mirage. But it's upbeat and motivating.
I'm starting to think she might just be leading us on.
I say we leave at half time.
Florence always manages to put a positive spin on things.
I can’t believe half of us voted for this.
Now, there's a mirage I can really get behind.
Tough act to follow.
And they say men are too proud to ask for directions..
A twenty says she's lost.
I can't believe I'm saying this, but maybe we should ask for directions.
I knew we should have marched to the beat of a different drummer.
At least we're not behind the elephants anymore.
At which point will the saints come marching in?
Maybe she's been leading us on?
Remember to look sharp when we go past the reviewing stand.
I fear we are being misled by a Drumph Majorette
Mirage a trois.
I figure that sooner or later we'll end up in front of Macy's.
This will go down in history as the famous baton death march.
This is your best mirage yet, Frank.
Following her on Facebook was easier.
At least we're no longer following the elephants.
If we're lucky it will rain on our parade!
I can't believe you convinced me to follow a third party candidate.
Please, it's been five days since we ate the tuba player.
At least we're not following the elephant!
Just this once, I wish it would rain on our parade.
I also follow her on social media .
Worst. Band camp. Ever.
We could use some rain on this parade.
And they say that MEN refuse to ask for directions?
I think she is just leading us on.
It's called the baton death march.
I'm thinking of quitting the band.
You're out of step again.
Maybe she has no idea where she's going, but I respect her enthusiasm.
Great. Now I'm going to have that song stuck in my head all day!
Just once I'd like to see it rain on this parade.
It beats wandering around aimlessly.
Not the first time a woman has led us astray.
Look at the bright side. At least we're not following the horses.
She has no idea where any water is, but I like her spunk.
You're out of step again.
I'm married to her - what's your excuse?
I'm kind of hoping it rains on our parade.
She's a tough act to follow.
My mother warned me that chasing skirts would be the death of me.
What do you think our second wish should be?
If you ain't the lead dog, the scenery never changes.
OK, it's a mirage, but it's my mirage.
She promised me low taxes and no immigrants
You're out of step.
Worst. Halftime show. Ever.
No, she's not with me, I thought she was with you.
I thought she was with you.
Without her we'd be nowhere
Is this the Baton Death March?
I sure wish it would rain on our parade!
"I liked the Macy's Parade a lot more before global warming.
I wish it would rain on our parade.
She has more followers than we do.
I think being out of step is the least of my worries.
I was going to sign up for the Mars expedition but then I thought, hey, this is something I can do right now.
I figure it's gotta rain on our parade eventually, right?
I'm hoping it will rain on her parade
I hope it rains on her parade.
Let's hope it rains on this parade.
I think she's leading you on.
Its the view thats keeping me going.
Without her we would've run right into that rock.
Let's hope it rains on our parade.
It'll be worth it just to see the look on her face when she realizes the band went the other way.
I used to wonder around aimlessly until she came along.
What? No - I'm following the bear on a unicycle...
I'm still kind of hoping you are the mirage
You think she knows there's only two of us left?
I know. And just minutes ago things seemed bleak.
If she were my mirage, she would be naked.
Of course it's a mirage, but she seems to know where she's going.
We never should have joined the Death Valley Marching Band.
" I was hoping for a rescue without the fanfare".
I literally want it to rain on her parade.
Of course she's a mirage. So am I.
Actually, I'd rather it DID rain on her parade.
For me, it's the boots.
Give it up Phil. If she hasn't noticed you by now...
It's an away game!
I can walk, I just like the view.
"Ever get the feeling that she might be just leading us on?''
D'ya think it's too late to change majors?
Good call on dumping the tubas.
OK. My turn for the shadow.
The next game we're valet parking.
Let's hope it rains on this parade.
"I really wish that it would rain on our parade".
Suddenly I'm wishing it did rain on our parade.
I hope to God it starts raining on this parade.
OK, so she can read music. I still say she can't read a map.
Next time, we follow MY hallucination.
Who else do you follow?
Get it? It’s the baton death march.
Maybe your mirage has a friend for me.
Miss one band practice and pay for it forever.
What majorette?
You have to admit, it's not as bad since we ditched our tubas.
If we're just imagining her, does that make us sexist?
I assumed you knew her.
So do I say, "How much further?" Or is it "farther?"
You're out of step.
I said I'd follow her to the ends of the Earth. I think we're almost there.
I think we lost something when the band died.
So, this is the road not taken.
Let's hope it rains on our parade.
Still think choosing a leader who promised to take us in a new direction was a good idea?
Sad. She's obviously hallucinating. Not a band in sight.
I wasn't following her. I was following you.
At least it won't rain on our parade.
This really is a tough act to follow.
Trust me, eventually we'll end up at Macy's.
I'm dying for it to rain on her parade.
You know what, Sam? I kinda wish it would rain on our parade.
This really is the baton death march.
I don't hear the band anymore, do you?
See...I told you she's not wearing any.
I guess I never really appreciated dry humor before
I really wish it would rain on my parade!
In this case, I hope it does rain on our parade.
It’s got a good beat, kind of easy to crawl to.
By the way my name's Dave.
I can't believe she hasn't noticed us yet...
It's the journey, not the destination.
I'm just saying, if we spell anything, 'SOS' makes more sense than 'Ohio.'
I see the piccolo player finally dropped off.
I think you're out of step.
I told you we'd outlast the Tubas.
A little rain on this parade might actually be refreshing.
I’m really hoping it rains on her parade.
For argument's sake, let's imagine that it is in fact a divining rod.
let's just follow her on instagram from here!
I know she's not really there. I just love parades.
I miss the band.
Next year I'm going on a float.
We definitely took a wrong turn during the fight song.
This was the worst Band Camp ever!
I hate Band Camp.
Seventy-six perfectly sensible trombonists and we had to follow her.
When do you think she's going to realize that we're no longer a band?
And to think I laughed at that fortune teller for being so specific.
I can't remember. Is she your mirage or mine?
I really wish it would rain on my parade!
She got decommissioned after leading her band into the Potomac.
How do I know you're not the mirage?
These Rose Bowl tickets you got from your brother-in-law --- what section were they in?
She plans to make Death Valley great again.
What if she's lost?
She's a showgirl from the Mirage.
Actually, I don't care if she knows where she's going.
Is this your hallucination or mine?
I'm beginning to think she's also lost.
Just think where we'd be without her
Is it possible she's lost too?
Are you sure she has a sister?
I'd like to see the looks on all their faces when they find out they made a wrong turn.
I call it Baton Death March
Who cares if it's a mirage? I love a parade.
Is this your first No Pride Parade?
She has the Pomp, but I wonder if she understands the Circumstance.
Actually Frank, I think we crossed the line in the sand for weirdness some time back.
She's probably just a mirage-erette.
Next time, we follow MY hallucination.
As mirages go, she ranks right up there close to water.
It’s hard to believe we started out with 50 eligible bachelors.
This won't end well, but the fact she stayed in character the entire time is REALLY impressive.
When did he say we'll be great again?
Next time I'll request less pomp and more circumstance.
Pssst....our mirage isn't wearing any underwear.
Really? I voted for Trump, too!
Hey Frank, this is a pub crawl, right?
Macy’s did say they would route the parade away from Trump Tower.
I told you my flair gun would work.
I wonder how the guys following Moses are doing.
When she stops we stand up and form the word Ohio.
No, it is right-left-right.
I hope it'll rain on our parade.
Remember, when they go high, we go low.
Hey Sam. If you don't mind, I'm going to ask her out for a drink later.
These seats better be good.
Our only hope is for someone to rain on her parade.
Good idea, dropping those tubas.
She calls it the Baton Death March.
What's a mirage et trois?
I knew we should have followed the rabbit with the giant pocket watch.
Your on the wrong hand.
Now I'll never get that song out of my head.
I say, let it rain on my parade.
Does it sound like the music's getting fainter?
Stop asking if we're there yet.
We should have bailed with the 76 trombones.
Honestly, have you ever been to a worse parade?
No panties day!!
The first rule of band camp initiation is: you don't talk about band camp initiation.
We are the parade, you dunce!
Smart move ditching the tubas.
What majorette?
She doesn't know, does she?
I thought she said follow me for dessert.
I'm starting to think we should have turned the other way back there with the rest of the band.
Maybe this is something I should've raised a few miles back, but I think we might have been distracted by the spectacle
I really wish someone would come along and rain on our parade ...
Could really use some rain on this parade.
This has become a baton death march.
One of us is out of step.
Really? My mirage looks like Robert Preston.
It's almost time for my solo.
I was a lot more enthusiastic when there were seventy-six of us.
I thought she said come this way for dessert
A little rain on my parade sounds pretty good right now.
I'm kind of hoping it'll rain on her parade.
What are you doing after this?
This is the last time I will trust a Yelp review.
I hope it rains on her parade.
I just hope we make it back in time for the second half.
Any chance it could rain on this parade?
I don't know where she's going, but she's doing it with conviction.
Are you sure this is the Trump bandwagon?
I hope someone rains on our parade.
I'm as surprised as you are, but she's really given my life direction.
So much for 'what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.'
Is it just me, or are halftimes getting longer?
I'm starting to think that maybe some who wander are in fact lost.
Can we switch back to the oasis mirage now?
Until now...I thought "I'd follow her to the end of the earth" was just an expression.
I've come to the realization that I don't really love a parade all that much.
Of course she's real, where would we be without her?
Do you suppose we are being misled?
You think I'm delusional? What about this majorette who's marching without a band?
Please...rain on our parade.
Please stop saying that you love a parade.
Do you remember where we parked the car?
Well, we're past the rock, hope we get to the hard place soon.
I guess my ex was right about me. I really am a hopeless skirt chaser.
It's not a mirage. She isn't wearing underwear.
It's more fun when there's a band.
This 6/8 beat is killing me.
Are you still sure that's a divining rod?
You want to just try Google maps?
Some people are just born leaders.
Spin classes are so last year...
No, the "Bataan Death March" was spelled differently.
I'm simply delighted to learn that dying of thirst is so much like a Fellini movie.
I think I'm out of step.
I can't help it. I love a parade.
She goes high, we go low.
I thought you knew her!
Okay, I grant you that the lake was a mirage, the Starbucks was a mirage, the MacDonald's and the Chipotle were mirages, but I swear she winked at me.
I don't know about you but a parade always lifts my spirits!
The parade is real. It's global warming that's a delusion.
I think this is the Mirage Day Parade.
IS THIS A TRUMP PRESIDENCY METAPHOR?" "YES THIS IS A TRUMP PRESIDENCY METAPHOR.
Why didn't we just pay extra for the GPS?
I, for one, don't love a parade.
I sure wish it would rain on our parade!
Remember, smile and wave to the crowd.
You think half-time is over yet?
Because everyone loves a parade, that's why.
Next time, I get to pick the mirage, okay?
Sure beats being stranded on a small island with only a palm tree.
This would be more fun with music
It's times like this I wish I played an instrument.
One more chorus of "Strike up the Band" and I'm turning around!
After forty years in the desert, we're finally going to a bowl game.
I take it back. I DON'T love a parade.
Wow, those boots really were made for walking.
Not long ago, I followed another strong, confident woman who claimed to know where she was headed ... and it turned out pretty much like this.
When we asked God to lead us out of this desert, I didn't expect this.
She's hot.
What if we had followed the elephants?
She's not much on direction, but you can't beat her enthusiasm
The hardest thing for me is keeping the beat.
I wish someone would rain on our parade.
I think I misread the invitation. I thought it said 'Come for dessert.
I wish she'd stop and ask for directions.
She just keeps getting hotter and hotter.
It was the kinky boots, wasn't it?
If you can see her too, I think we have a chance.
I don't remember the safe word either.
Trust me, this species of majorette always heads for water.
Maybe it will rain on her parade.
At least it won't rain on our parade.
That vulture float was amazing.
Will you PLEASE stop whistling "Seventy-six Trombones"?
I don't care; I'm still with Her!
I'm beginning to think this is not the way back to Macy's.
How much further before we tell her the rest of the band is dead.
I see London! I see France!
I'll keep smiling to the crowd but I'm done waving!
Okay, is it just me or have I seen that grain of sand before?
Are you sure that's a divining rod?
Look on the bright side. Joining the band gets us out of P.E.
Best mirage this week.
We had 76 trombones when we started.
Funny thing is, in high school she wouldn't give me the time of day.
It never rains on this parade.
Now would be an ideal time for it to rain on our parade.
I told you we should have ridden on the float instead.
I'm with her!
But we're making great time.
Trust me Jerry, it's bound to rain on her parade eventually.
When are we going to quit following every skirt that parades by?
This is far more entertaining than the palm tree mirage we had yesterday.
Well according to MY mirage, YOU’RE out of step!
I can't believe it's still half-time.
I wish somebody would rain on her parade!
You want to tell her she's lost or should I?
How long is halftime?
She's lost too, but you have to give her style points
Keep following her. Where there is a drum major, there is a large cooler of Gatorade.
What's the downside if we stop following her?
I thought that Trump's inaugural parade would look flashier than this.
By all means, rain on my parade!
Don't you just love a parade?
I can't decide what's worse — that she's leading us to our doom, or that she's been behind the beat for the last ten miles."
Either she's deaf or we're dumb.
Thank goodness there are no elephants in this parade.
Thank heaven for Doris. I would have given up by now.
At least she's spunkier than the bagpipe player we had last week.
Thanks again for coming; this really means a lot to Katie and me.
Right hand forward Harold. Right hand.
Michigan State. How about you?
And just think of how many times we've said "Don't rain on my parade!"
I think it's safe to say, this is one parade that won't get rained on.
Ask her if she knows the way to San Jose.
How long can halftime last?
Mirage? No, I'm following her because she's got the same voice as my GPS.
Please let it rain on my parade.
I'm hoping we're gonna spell out "HELP" when we're done with "BEAT STATE."
Guess we should have followed the tuba player.
Something tells me we should have stopped for a water break with the rest of the band.
She certainly looked like she knew where she was going!
This rescue service is all show.
At least she went around the rock.
What happened to the seventy-six trombones?
Search and Rescue has really upped their game!
As mirages go, this one ain't bad.
Well I was standing on a corner in Winslow, Arizona.
I'm thinking about cutting out a little early to beat the traffic.
Well, it's cheaper than Burning Man.
Hey pal, no butting in line!
Relax, if those storm clouds come any closer, who do you think'll get zapped first?
We should try marching to the beat of a different drummer.
Once we lost the 76 trombones back there, I had a feeling we were in trouble.
Keep an open mind, she says she can bring us jobs...
Wait, I thought this was your mirage.
I wonder what second prize was.
Death Valley State always has a great halfway show.
Well, didn't I tell you this was a majorette mistake?
The Macy's parade gets longer every year.
I'm enjoying this one. You get to pick the next mirage as well.
I see London.....
I hope it rains on her parade _ soon!
Excellent! It's the old Ethel Merman mirage.
I'd ask her, but I've only just started seeing her.
I sure hope it's gonna rain on this parade!
Let's rethink moving the NFL to Vegas.
Well, we got trouble, and that starts with "T" and that rhymes with "D" and that stands for desert.
The one time that I actually need it to rain on my parade and not a drop!
I just don't believe in unfollowing people.
I'm not mad at you anymore for using up our final wish.
At least we outlasted the band.
At this point I'd settle for rain on our parade.
In my reality I am the hallucination.
How long does halftime last?
Hey, you're out of step.
I'm telling you, she's a drum miragette.
Stay in step!
Well, she is 97% water.
That 3/8 time signature is a killer.
I would love some rain on this parade.
Well, the good news is that this hallucination means we've reached the halfway point.
If you say "I love a parade" one more time, I'm going to strangle you.
I can see up her skirt.
This is the last time I hook up with someone on March.com
I think she's leading you on.
An hour ago I would have sworn she was a camel!
I told you to go before we left.
I thought the piccolo player would have lasted a little longer.
I'm beginning to have doubts.
I thought I was hallucinating, but then I heard the band.
I actually hope it rains on this parade.
That's it for me. No more chasing women.
No, it's left knee on the beat.
Oh no, I was crawling long before she showed up.
I wish it would hurry up and rain on our parade already.
Remind me again why she couldn't just "tell" us how to get there??
Oh yeah? Since when does a Mirage leave boot prints?
We really wasted time going around that rock
You're not in sync.
It's been two days. Let's face it, no one is going to turn out for this thing.
Maybe we should have marched to the beat of somebody else's drummer.
Mirage? No, I think she's from the Bellagio.
I've been thinking, she probably should have made a left on 59th Street.
Do you ever get the feeling we put too much faith in the system?
Next time let's spring for one that comes with GPS.
Oh, give her a break. It's her first day.
I told you she'd go around the rock.
Is it wrong to hope that it rains on her parade?
Shedding those drums made a world of difference, don't you think?
The tuba players are always the first to go.
You know, it's not sexist to ask her if she's sure this is the right way.
Are you sure she can get us "Hamilton" tickets?
As mirages go...this one's a dandy!
May it rain on her parade!
That is a divining rod, right?
This is much better than following the elephants.
She's really more of a 'fantasy' than a 'mirage.'
It just isn't the same without confetti.
This is much easier without the tuba.
Stay in formation!
What drum majorette?!
I'm saying it must be a hell of an oasis
Burning Man sure looks a lot different in the pictures.
She's always been an optimist.
I still think it's better than last year's Burning Man.
So this one time at band camp...
I can't help it, I just love a parade.
"When I started following she was a Clydesdale pulling a beer wagon."i
Having a leader with great stamina and no sense of direction is not working for me.
I think that for a mirage she keeps cadence quite well.
Well, we did vote for change.
Maybe it will rain on her parade.
Don't look at me, we both voted for him!
Next time we follow my Mirage.
I hope we get back to the stadium in time for the second half.
I'd say she's a few trombones short of 76, wouldn't you?
I hope this mirage knows where's she going!
Seems like a big buildup for a cup of water.
I really hope it rains on this parade.
Keep following. She's the new secretary of the interior
I follow her on Twitter also
Hallucination or not, she's got spirit.
Next time we follow the different drummer.
Best mirage we've ever had!
Handel's Water Music, what do you hear?
I know she's only a mirage, but what else have we got?
She knows we're here, right?
Best mirage ever!
are we there yet ?
In your mirage, is she blonde or brunette?
Not the Inauguration parade most of us were expecting.
Are you sure that's a divining rod?
Is she your mirage or mine?
Bro, Burning Man, am I right?
I was a drummer. What did you play?
I agree she's attractive and has lots of energy but I'm starting to think she's not that smart.
Next year, we're mapping out the parade route online first.
Look the bright side -- at least there aren't any horses.
We ARE the band.
Get your own mirage, this one's mine!
Forget the water. I want her optimism.
Guess what I am hallucinating now.
As mirages go, one could do worse.
You won't believe my next wish.
Stay in step!
And, you're sure she winked at us during the game.
Funny...A second ago she was wearing underpants.
Is is too late to pick 'truth'?
I still can't tell if she's wearing panties.
Is it just me, or is she actually picking up the pace?
I chose an entertaining leader, not a good one.
She has a lousy sense of direction but I'd follow those legs anywhere.
I thought we were following her only on Facebook.
Perhaps following the water boy would have been a better idea.
Now you ‘oom’ and I’ll ‘pah.’
Makes you wonder why we're crawling.
Is the rest of the band still back there?
This mirage is more up beat than the last one.
It's only when you're close to death that you really learn to appreciate the arts.
I'd follow her anywhere.
There are worse leaders out there.
Some poor saps just see an oasis.
And to think we were running from clowns a month ago.
I wished for an endless parade of dessert, I swear.
Is this your first parade?
Suppose it isn't a mirage!
It's a good thing no horses are in the parade!
We picked the right leader. We could have crawled straight into that rock.
Ask her to spin that baton. We might get a breeze.
I'm beginning to think she's not leading us back to Burning Man.
Can you at least try to stay in step?
Me? I said I'd follow her to the ends of the earth, and she said, "OK, let's go." You?
Be patient, she's getting us seats right on the field.
Do you still love a parade?
I think it's time I started marching to the beat of my own drummer.
Maybe it'll finally rain on her parade.
I think we're missing the game.
I hope this isn't the baton death march.
She motivates me to go the extra mile.
I said "imagine a marshy mirage,"not "imagine a marching Marge."
Just how long is half-time?
Someday we'll be able to tell our grandkids that we survived the baton death march.
I was waiting for Godot and she came along.
If she was wearing underwear, I don't think I would have followed her this far.
Now THERE'S a mirage I can get behind!
I feel bad about leaving the 76 trombones behind.
As mirages go...
You would think she'd notice that 74 trombone players have been eaten by jackals.
She's taken us in a whole new direction.
I guess I really would follow her anywhere.
I'm just saying rain isn't the only consideration when planning a parade.
Remember, it's the journey not the destination.
Her favorite after-school activites are band and cross country.
Left arm forward -- stay in formation!
Here's hoping we're headed for River City.
I'm telling you, her invitation didn't say desert, it said dessert.
...and we thought we were lost!
Bob, I promise to introduce you on the way back
We're making great time!
Dear Global Warming, The Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade just isn't what it used to be.
This is the last Groupon I buy.
I'll be glad when halftime is over
Oh come on, Bill, this is way more fun than GPS.
I'd like to walk a mile in her shoes.
Hang in there, half-time's almost over.
It's just nice to have a sense of purpose again.
I told Stella I would follow her to the ends of the earth, but I didn't think there would be a test.
I think she’s lost
For a death march, I'm feeling pretty lively.
The premiere is tomorrow. Today is the dry run.
No, you're the one out of formation.
How long are we going to play along before we have to take Grandma back to the nursing home?
You gotta admit, she's one hell of a motivator.
It's a beat, but it's a dry beat.
I like enthusiasm in my mirages
I understand this is Sousa's longest march.
Let's agree this settles the "weaker sex" myth
Stop me if you think I'm wrong but I think she is out of step with reality.
Wish she'd ask directions.
You gotta crawl before you can march.
Well, at least she's still more accurate than Apple Maps.
When we came to the fork in the road we should have taken it.
This was the best office party ever.
She did so well in the polls...
Left, right, left. Are you new at this?
'No, YOU march to your own drummer, this is my mirage."
I want to see her face when she turns around!
I've been through the desert with a horse with no name, but never with a drum majorette with no band.
When did the music stop?
Keep in step, dude.
I sure hope she knows where she's going. We left the Rose Bowl two days ago.
She looks fantastic, but sometimes I question her leadership.
There's bound to be a stadium soon!
You're not in sync.
My mirage is a water fountain. What's yours?
Please, God, rain on this parade!
I don't care if she's real or not, we're making good time and I feel so peppy.
For the hundredth time , yes it's a long way to Tipperary
At least she stopped running.
She's a tall glass of water all right
You still believe it's a divining rod?
Remember, if anyone asks, our band uniforms are at the dry cleaners.
So if she's just a mirage, why are we following her?
I'm waiting for it to rain on her parade.
How could she not know the way to Macy's.
are we there yet ?
I am so sick of John Philip Sousa.
No, the bet's still on. She'll drop it next time.
At the beginning there were 76 trombones.
They did say November 8th we’d be done, right?
C'mon. Talk to her already...
The tubas were the first to go.
I think they changed the route this year.
We’d look a lot less silly about now if we’d brought our sousaphones.
We got trouble! With a capital 'T' that rhymes with 'D' that stands for 'dehydration'!
For next year, we might rethink the parade route.
Yeah, it's better following a mirage than nothing at all.
You know, I'm thinking of deleting Tinder.
When I wished for a tall drink of water, that's not what I had in mind.
Let's trade. Now you hum the music, and I'll do the drums.
If it will only rain on our parade.
No, it's a 'mirageorette'.
Now *this* is a baton death march.
She makes it seem all so worthwhile.
I never thought a death march would have so much pageantry.
I told you it never rains on her parade.
No, she really has Hamilton tickets.
Well, if we have to follow a mirage, at least the view for this one is spectacular.
We're still with her, right?
Yes, the twirls are entertaining, but the high tosses give me reason to live.
Pretty soon we'll see 72 virgins and 76 trombones.
So, you finally get it that she's been leading both of us on all along.
I thought this parade was supposed to end at Macy's.
I think I've got it now. It's left right not right left.
If this is what it took to get us talking again, then I say she's worth every penny.
As far as mirages go, this one ain't bad.
As mirages go, she's pretty perky.
These climate denier parades where much easier in the old days.
I know, but it was only only $20 with the Groupon.
These halftimes get longer and longer.
No rain is going to spoil THIS parade!
It's not so bad since the glockenspiel player dropped off.
I agree, "Baton Death March" would be an awful caption for this cartoon.
Sure I saw the oasis. But who doesn't love a parade?
Even so, it's the best mirage around.
Now I see it. She IS bending her right knee too much.
On second thought, maybe we shouldn't have voted for Trump.
Yeah, I know it's a mirage, but I love a good parade....
I hear there's a big finale.
For once I wish it WOULD rain on my parade.
This is starting to feel like a mistake.
Hey Frank, what if we stopped whistling Stars and Stripes Forever?
This is a long halftime!
How many more measures?
Good thing we decided not to bring our tubas.
This one parade I wish it would rain on.
Bob always loved marching bands, and now I regret eating him.
..and how long have you been a Browns fan?
She's hearing a different drummer.
Well, it looks like we're the final survivors of this Baton Death March...
You think the second half has started yet?
Marching to a different drummer isn't all that it's cracked up to be.
And the band parches on.
This is one time I wish it would rain on my parade!
The view doesn't get any better than this.
Easy for her, she didn't start out carrying a tuba.
I said I would follow her anywhere, in sickness and in health. Why are you here?
Remind me again how the Baton Death March ends?
Remember its not the journey, its the destination
That's no illusion. That's my wife.
How long does half-time usually last?
I know we probably shouldn't but how about one more time around
It helps if you imagine you're playing a tuba.
Remember the time when the 'Macy's Parade' was magical?
This is the best mirage ever!
I'm hoping it will rain on her parade
No, giving us water would just be enabling.
I'm no longer sure that I do love a parade.
You said she'd lead us to the Promised Band.
All I have to do is outlast you...
I think you should tell her those last two turns were a little unnecessary...
How about next year we try out for Glee Club instead of Marching Band?
You know, I sort of wish we had packed a light lunch.
I love a parade.
As mirages go, the legs are not bad.
Best view of a parade i've ever had.
Please God let it rain on this parade
It's the enthusiasm of the crowds that keep me going.
Do you see what I see?
You conjure your mirage, I'll conjure mine.
I wonder if this is a death march
If it is a mirage, why am I hearing trombones?
This Trump University Marching Band is NASTY!
I gotta admit it, I still love a parade!
I'd do almost anything for my boot fetish.
Did she say mirage or ménage?
I can't believe we're going to be great again!
Yeah, you're right! She's not wearing underwear.
She says she is going to make America great again.
I see London.....
Are you sure this is Burning Man?
I bet you lose your deposit on the drum.
I wonder if she realizes we gave up our tubas miles ago.
Now you know why I don't like asking for directions.
YOU tell her the election is over!
I don't know, I just like parades! You?
But she looked like she knew where she was going
Ever wonder why the rest of the band isn't following?
Marching band tryouts are rough this year.
I'm beginning to think that the parade's past us by.
So WHEN is it gonna rain on her parade already?
OK, I got it, I got it---" The Baton Death March."
When you get to your stop, you've got to alert the conductor.
Finally a parade route that doesn't block traffic.
I'd follow her anywhere.
Imagine what we'd do for a cheerleader.
We should follow her on Twitter.
It is amazing how far a good pair of legs can take a guy.
I lost all confidence in her when the trombones died.
I'm beginning to think she's never even heard of Macy's.
I get the feeling she's leading us to a major disappointment.
Nice that we get to go before the horses this year.
There was just something about her brash confidence that inspired me to follow.
I've always been a follower, what's your excuse?
Are you seeing this too?
I thought the team was playing at home.
That fabric must really breathe...
The trombones were the first to go. There were just too many.
I think women are natural leaders.
I told you we should have followed the clown with the dancing dog
Ya know, I'm not sure where she appeared from but she promised manufacturing jobs so I'm feeling pretty optimistic about where we're headed!
I only come out here for the mirages.
If we both see her? Then we're dead. Or on HBO.
What have we got to lose?
Twenty bucks says that's Robert Preston in drag .
This has a baton death march feel to it.
I've always been a sucker for parades.
I'm beginning to think we've been conned.
They are adding a string section tomorrow.
"You’re out of step; it’s left- right, left- right".
Will you stop humming that damn march already!
So what other horoscope advice have you followed in the past?
I was dreaming about the Bataan Death March, but apparently my REM state includes autocorrect.
Tell me again why you have to crawl before you can walk.
You gotta better idea?
Is it just me, or is this 'extreme parade experience' starting to lose its shine?
No, this was your idea.
I think we can go home now. If she hasn't dropped it yet she probably won't.
Halftime seems to be going on forever.
Forty years we've been out here, when do we reach the promised band?
'think she knows she has a run in her pantyhose?
Did we sign-up for the Baton Death March?
It's certainly a nice change from the oasis mirage.
We should hav traveled to the beat of a different drum major.
Your girlfriend is so upbeat.
I don't know about you, but I expected more big balloons and floats...
All I said was "With legs like those, I'd follow you anywhere!" What's YOUR excuse?
I'm feeling great again. Aren't you feeling great again?
What do you mean YOU saw her first?
I don't think we will make it by halftime.
After us come the floats.
I'm headed for Pasadena. You?
I said I would follow her to the ends of the earth. You, too?
I'm still with Her!
How's the new leadership working for you?
Next time I'll pick the mirage.
I do like a parade.
So this is what following her to the end of the earth is.
I’m starting to think she doesn’t want to go to homecoming with either of us.
Did he say Baton, or Bataan?
Looks like we're down 74 trombones.
I'm beginning to feel the bern...
Yeah, it might be a mirage, but try to keep in step anyway.
We should have "unfollowed" before our phones died.
Call me sexist, but I say this mirage is a keeper.
Is this your dream or mine?
I didn't even know you could get kicked out of Las Vegas.
So she gets into this costume and says to me, 'Come on, honey. I'll take you down a road not-travelled by. Bring a friend.' Any more questions?
I wonder if Moses' people had it this good.
It would be nice if we had a drummer,
You can have the sex if I can have the water.
I feel like a character in a New Yorker cartoon.
Her Tinder said she likes long walks...
No kidding, this is my first parade too!
Well, I guess it never rained on HER parade...
If I didn't know better, I'd think we weren't anywhere near Macy's.
My question about a coherent theory of collective delusion is, 'Are we there yet?'
I swear to God, Larry… The second she drops that baton I am making a run for it
If I survive, I will curse Sousa the rest of my life!
Our dry humor keeps her going.
"Imagine that. Just yesterday we were in the rear of the parade".
She obviously doesn't know where she is going, but you have to admire her enthusiasm!
Who doesn't love a parade ?
See what trouble chasing skirts has gotten us into.
So where's the rain on this parade?
When should we tell her she lost the band?
Wow, mirages sure have come a long way!
Your other left.
I think we're almost at Burning Man.
First the rats, then the children, now us
Does it seem like the Thanksgiving Day Parade gets longer each year?
You know how I usually tell you not to rain on my parade?
I guess I've always been a follower.
You say Baton, I say Bataan .... let's call the whole thing off!
Neither did they believe in Moses , when he walked out on Egypt...
I haven't heard a drum since Tuesday.
I'll say it again. A musical half-time salute to "Ishtar" is a bad idea.
I think she’s lost
Can't wait until we're great again
When the hell is she gonna pass the baton?
I see you're having the same weird dream I am.
What happened to the different drummer
I take it back. This parade could use some rain, after all.
What if it turns out she is just a cactus?
It's gotta be a metaphor for something or other.
We thought we had trouble back in River City.
How far away is Macy's.
Funny you should ask...I do still love a parade.
I'd have preferred a marsh.
Your wife's a real trooper.
And to think an hour ago we were at a spa sipping Mojitos; she's good--she's very good.
I love a woman in a uniform.
Well if she's a mirage how do you explain the marching band?
Are you sure she knows the way to San Jose?
At what point are we NOT with her?
If this is halftime, we're goners.
You know, of course, this is pretty much how we wound up voting for Trump, don't you?
Appears that Hillary's following thinned out after the election
We should have stayed on the bus with the band!
At least we won't be starved for entertainment.
These pep rally tryouts are more gruelling than I expected
Love the new GPS!
Worst threesome ever.
Well, at least its not raining!
Seems a bit intense for a dress rehersal
I think these half time shows are way too long
I think I left the stove on.
This was President Trump's plan B for patrolling the Mexican border.
I love halftime!
It's still better than the election.
Is this your mirage or my mirage?
Please...rain on our parade.
I think we took a wrong turn back at the fifty.
You have to get passed her.
Let's try to think of it as a resume builder.
Well, you just have to trust your leaders...
I didn't think the hazing for cheerleader would be so difficult.
Why you say? I'll tell you why, because I've always been a leg man.
I think you're offbeat.
I'm still with Her!
I told you that America would become great again!
This is the worst half-time hallucination ever.
I like to see a woman exhibiting leadership qualities.
Remember, she can't make us drink.
I'm sure it'll be great again any minute.
This is the best mirage we have had yet.
I love the way she splashes through the mirages.
Sure it feels like a campaign promise, but imagine if it pays off.
It's not my fault. I thought she said we were going for desert.
Beware of the Ida of march.
She still thinks Hillary is going to win.
The "Baton" Death March
I'm beginning to think that she is a miragerette.
I think we made a wrong turn after the Snoopy float.
I don't care if she's a mirage -- I'm joining the band.
When the band stops playing, then worry.
How many times now?? It's LEFT RIGHT LEFT Stan -- how is that so difficult?
I'd like to rain on her parade.
Last year's parade was bigger, wasn't it?
I don't know what I want more, water or a slide trombone.
She got us into this, and she can get us out.
I believed her when she said it always rained on her parade. Now what?
There has to be a football game around here somewhere!
The only thing that keeps me going is the view from down here.
This halftime show has taken several strange turns.
It was better with the band . . .
I"m not one to complain, but wasn't last years parade shorter?
You were right: This is easier without the sousaphones.
What, you couldn't have imagined a drinking fountain?
You realize the parade ended about 1,000 miles ago right?
Tell me again why we signed up for Band Boot Camp.
Dibs on the hat.
Sure glad we ditched the tubas!
But I don't hear any drums.
I'll trade you 76 trombones for one glass of water.
Okay, one more mile. But that's it.
I'm telling you, this isn't the yellow brick road.
I love the silence of this place.
Do you even remember what parade this is?
Mirage or fake news?
The world is full of unlikely leaders.
What do you mean, out of step?
These triathlons are getting out of hand.
I'm not that thirsty. I just love a parade.
I figure where there's halftime, there should be beverages.
No, you tell her the last of the marching band died off five miles back.
I used to love a parade!
I like her confidence.
You're right. They always look sexier from a distance.
How drunk were we when we promised to follow her to the ends of the earth?
You have really weird hallucinations.
Look on the bright side, traffic was much worse during his first inaugural parade.
She might have a lousy sense of direction, but just look at those thighs!
Does your mirage have epaulettes too?
Oh yeah, I'm still with her.
"Orchestra," I said. "No, the marching band's better exercise," you said.
Is it just me or is this mirage hot?
I'm here because she promises to create jobs.
I've got rhythm!
Keep up the pace, you're making us look bad!
I think this is the stage they call march madness.
Her workout sessions really make you feel the burn.
I don't think her stamina was the issue.
The Macy's parade really doesn't work in other places.
I'm not sure her enthusiasm makes up for her lack of topographical expertise.
What happened to the other 74 guys and our trombones?
Can't you keep in step?
Is it me, or is halftime taking longer than usual?
You have to admit, it's a catchy tune.
I hear she's one of the top picks for Secretary of Transportation.
Mirage or not, If she drops the baton she'll have to bend over to pick it up.
Well, I guess what happened didn't actually stay in Vegas....
Ask her if she takes requests.
I thought there would be more spectators.
Whaddya bet the glockenspiels and tubas are yukking it up over tequilas right now back in Albuquerque.
How can this be a mirage? Look at those boots!
It's time we crawl to the beat of our own drum
What happened in Vegas, stays in Vegas, right?
Is she taking the long way?
When do you think she’ll realize that everyone else is dead?
Cross off 'Marching Band' on my bucket list.
Think how screwed we'd be, if Global Warming was REAL!
And how is marching to a different drummer working out for you?
Nice boots.
I think we got trouble right here in Desert City.
The Scots don't either, under THEIR kilts.
I knew climate change would impact the Rose Parade, but this is ridiculous.
We lost the other 74 trombones miles ago...
My buddy told me all the best action in Vegas is off The Strip.
Thoreau's different drummer led him to a pond.
When's halftime over?
Who doesn't love a parade ?
Maybe she's taking this "Road Less Traveled" thing too far?
Ever think – maybe we should've let the parade pass us by?
I voted for Trump. What are you being punished for?
Are we not entertained?
I'm beginning to feel like a third wheel here. You go on without me.
I'm afraid the parade has passed us by.
I just wish she'd change the tempo.
Hey, get your own mirage mister.
Well, at least the view is nice.
See, all we needed was a little distraction.
How much longer until we admit global warming is real?
I'm beginning to think she's a mirage.
She'll ask for directions.
We should get there by halftime.
It's times like this I really wish I wasn't a 'legs' man..
Now I wish we'd gone a head and jumped on the bandwagon!
See what happens when you ask for directions?
Rain on her parade...rain on her parade, enough already!
I miss the old days when my travel agent planned my vacations.
The view from here isn't all that bad.
You'll be the flute for a while, and I'll be the drum
I stopped hearing it a long time ago too.
Hear that Roy? We're going to the Inauguration!
This is way better than the spin class mirage!
I'm starting to think we should have stayed with the rest of the band.
Man, these tryouts for The Music Man are getting tougher and tougher.
Don't let their welcoming committee fool you--it's a dry county.
Could be worse. She could be wearing boxers.
They are nice boots but that's not the point.
I'm starting to believe that ISN'T a divining rod.
I know she's just a mirage, but she keeps impeccable timing.
Mirage or no mirage; she's a tall drink of water. That's good enough for me.
I hope she's leading us to water and not salted peanuts.
Which bathroom are you going to use?
For an extra forty dollars she came with my GPS.
Every once in a while she drops it.
It's not too late to turn back, is it?
With this new app it may take longer but I never sit in traffic.
Since it was only a 2-credit course, I figured, 'how tough could it be'?
Everybody loves a parade.
I thought YOU were watching the street signs.
Please tell me again just why we're following her.
I've always admired women in uniform.
I can't help it, I'm a natural born follower.
And if she could march in a straight line she'd be perfect.
You meant it - her legs are to die for.
At least now we aren't the only ones who deeply regret having blindly followed the loudest person around.
We're duned.
Did you mail in your absentee ballot?
At what point did we go from marching to crawling?
I crawl to the beat of a different drum.
March to a different beat, they said--it will be fun, they said...
Im enjoying this mirage a lot more than the one of the swamp.
I don't know where she gets her optimism.
I told you orchestra was better than marching band.
It's the end of the road for this ol' skirt chaser.
I can't hear the drums anymore, can you ?
I must admit I was a little suspicious when she wanted us to join her for a drink
Who won the game?
I can't wait for the half-time show.
Somebody tell the consultant that the rest of us think these company retreats suck.
Best company retreat ever.
I don't care how much tickets cost. Next time, I'm jumping on the band wagon.
I like the take-charge type, too.
Up for a drink after band?
I'm a follower. You?
Better rain on my parade!
Is that all you can think of. You lost your clarinet,
She's good, but this music is fantastic.
But would you also swim the deepest ocean for her?
Maybe she is a mirage, but it sure takes your mind off being thirsty.
If the next song isn't Handel's Water Music, I'm giving up.
Nice ass
She sure knows how to boost morale.
Other than that stretch where we spelled 'Ohio' I'd say we've made real good time.
It's not stalking if we believe we're in a parade.
Sing "I love a parade" one more time and you're toast!
I'm all for school spirit, but this is ridiculous.
I know they said these were off-Broadway prices but this is ridiculous!
Maybe we should sing a faster song.
I don't want water as much as I want her to stop humming that same dang tune.
Her enthusiasm is really catching.
It's good to be great again.
I'm beginning to think that's not a divining rod.
It's only halftime
Do you think she knows we're desperate?
Good call on the choice of mirage
Don't tell me. You love a parade too?
Maybe someone will rain on her parade.
All my life I just wanted to be in a cartoon.
I could use a little less pageantry, a little more water.
I love a strong leader.
I just love a parade....even if it's a mirage.
She said the football game is just around the next dune.
She may be a mirage, but she’s a damn good mirage.
How much farther before we decide we've been duped?
At least we're ahead of the trombones.
I am beginning to suspect she might be marching to a different drummer.
I don't think she knows where she's going. She just likes to lead.
You sure she said Rosebowl?
I'd follow a woman in boots anywhere!
So what was it that made you take up the trombone?
Wait a minute, did she ever say specifically how she plans to march America great again?
I had no choice but to ditch my tuba.
We only have to do this for four years. I hope.
Man, this is a long half-time.
See what I mean? Without leadership, I'd have gone around the left side of those rocks.
Wait til she notices we dropped our tubas a couple of miles back.
I like these new motivational mirages.
I just don't have the heart to tell her the parade ended two hours ago.
Maybe we should think about marching to the beat of our own drummer.
I guess we are both skirt chasers.
You and your no frills travel guide.
This is a really lousy band camp!
I thought it was your mirage.
"We're going to perform at the Mirage Bowl".
I'm starting to hate John Phillip Sousa.
"i'm with her" hasn't been working out so well.
Now this is the way to die!
She's a lot more attractive than our last GPS system.
Do we still end up at 34th street?
Still, quite a death march.
I just love a parade.
Just you remember, she'll make Arizona great again.
I don't know about you, but dying of thirst, exposure and starvation doesn't seem so bad when you have a little pep in your step.
Now do you understand why dad left her?
Any chance this figment of your imagination could march a little slower?
It's not as much fun as when I was a kid, somehow.
Nice tall drink of water!
This had better be a frickin' great oasis.
I was in the trombone section.
Thank God, she didn't make us bring the tubas.
...sure wish it would rain on my parade.
Yes, yes I know, we'll just follow the gps next time.
I'm tired of crawling in cadence.
At least she's not making us spell out Ohio.
I was a Senator. You?
I'm still hoping it'll rain on our parade...
I feel really good about this decision.
I know it's a mirage, but what the hell.
Even my delusion is delusional.
I don't think this is going to end well!
That was a tricky set of turns
Truth is, I don't love a parade.
When is she going to pass the baton?
Didn't she say she was going to Burning Man?
You were right. It's not a divining rod.
Think we might arrive by game-time?
Next stop, River City!
This once I hope it does rain on your parade.
I almost lost her at the last stoplight.
She was very fairly elected to be our drum major, now just give her a chance.
I don't have the heart to tell her we haven't been marching for at least 20 miles.
I've always been a sucker for parades.
Who else are we gonna follow?
This mirage has much better legs than your typical distant pool of water.
At least we got to drop our drums in Tucson.
Tell me honestly, Leon, do you think it is remotely possible that we should be marching to a different drummer?
You know, so much of life comes down to finding the right cadence...
It's worth it on the off-chance she's not a mirage.
We should have marched to the beat of our own drummer.
No more discount guided tours for me.
She's making the desert great again.
So this is what goes on at band camp!
Oh yeah, it's real. The hips don't lie.
I bet she doesn't realize how ridiculous she looks.
Don't worry, Pasadena is just over the next ridge.
I'm not so sure that's a dowsing rod.
Mirage? Ok, so what!
This isn't how I pictured the final round of interviews to play out.
I hate to rain on your parade but what drum majorette?
I wish she was waving a divining rod instead of a baton.
I didn't know band camp would be like this.
I believe we're out of step.
And you were afraid we wouldn't make the team!
I don't care if she's childish and has never served in a marching band. I just want change.
Keep going. It's only halftime.
ya know, I still have that song stuck in my head.
I'm about to give up on this concept of marching to the beat of a different drummer.
'Ya know - I'm starting to get the feeling like maybe they don't want us in the band?'
Are you sure she said this was the road less traveled?
At the next rock, I'll distract her and you grab the baton...but I get the hat.
What's a Fitbit?
I have no idea where we're headed, but it's great to see the leadership vacuum filled.
Her last gig was at the Mirage in Vegas.
Does she even know we got a crush on her?
I don't know about you, but I've always had a thing for a woman in uniform.
The good news is we've made it to halftime.
Seriously Bro, I think she's over you.
I love a parade.
These Half-Time Shows keep getting longer and longer.
I know she's not real, but the heels are a nice touch
I know, next time we use the GPS
I'm hoping she's headed for River City.
I can't wait for halftime to end.
Are we sure it's a divining rod?
This has been an unusually warm march.
Band Camp must be tougher than we thought.
So when did you join Crossfit?
Did you notice the tuba player dropped out a while back?
Come on, sing it with me! 'On Wisconsin, on Wisconsin!'
Frankly, I'd rather be water-boarded.
This ain't nothing yet. Wait 'til you see the wall!
"Uh Oh, it looks like it might rain on our parade.
I played the clarinet. You?
I think we're victims of March Madness.
Best mirage I ever saw
She’s my kind of gal. She refuses to stop and ask for directions.
Well, at least his deportation officers are good looking.
We should've listened to the camel.
Guess who she voted for?
This isn't quite the midnight at the oasis I expected!
Do you think we'll miss the second half?
I don't care if it's only a mirage. At least we're getting somewhere.
It's the best mirage so far!
I just love a parade.
You ate the last brownie at half-time.
What's the odds on it being a divining rod?
I don't mind saying that there's a little part of me that wishes she would have stopped at the waterhole around six miles back.
Wait, that doesn't look like a divining rod to me!
Who told you that you could find water with a stick?
Naturally, the Arizona State game is on the road
We waited too long -- it'll be awkward if we tell her what happened to the rest of the band now.
I said, 'Dessert.'
I'm telling you, it's bound to rain on her parade eventually.
How can she walk in those heels?
Remember, we could be with the clown in the Himalayas
To think--a couple weeks ago, I was holding down that BIG Snoopy balloon.
I replaced her baton with a rainstick. Just watch.
Should we tell her we should have turned left at the gas station?
If it's a mirage, then how come we can hear the music?
"Blow in my ear and I'll follow you anywhere", I told her. You, too?
She's great! We already covered 5 miles since she joined us!
You're right, your mirage is better than mine.
I hate these Mojave State halftime shows.
I TOLD you this POKEMON GO thing IS A DISASTER! Happy now?
These footprints seem freshly made, we can't be far behind her now!
What makes you think a majorette can lead us to the promised land?
I beg to differ, but it's left. . . right. . .left.
The Parade is not well attended this year
On the bright side, she's less annoying than a tiger on a boat.
Enough already with the 'Oom Pah Pah'.
I know its just a mirage, but please don't tell my wife?
I told her if She went Commando, I'd follow Her anywhere!
Oh, shut up! Baton death march, indeed!
We're just about out of mirages.
When we passed the oasis she just came darting out of the palm trees.
I'm starting to think our majorette is more like a mirage-ette.
She marches to the beat of a different, drier, drummer
I'm not paying extra for this Gary.
Maybe we shouldn't have held the straight pride parade on inauguration day.
Why do I have to crawl on my hands and knees to have my caption picked?
Either way we're deserters
This is more fun than I thought it would be.
She can lead us to water but she can't make us drink.
I hid my tuba behind that last rock.
Is peeking under her skirt worth it?
I don't care what the song says, next time I'm letting the parade pass by.
When do we break it to her that I dropped my tuba and you dropped your trombone 27 miles ago?
She promised to take me to Las Vegas--and you?
Something seems...wrong, you know?
Yep, you're dying.
You have to admire her perseverance.
Who told you that it would rain on her parade?
It was either her now or Godot whenever....
I'm sure glad we made America great again.
Takes your mind off of the election.
If we're lucky, it's a divining rod.
Can we try downtempo for a mile or two?
Think she could drum up a cold one?
She does know how thirsty we are, right ?
I'm starting to rethink this whole emigrate to Canada thing.
I suspect that we Americans may be fools.
Ok, you do the drums and I'll do the horns.
...of course the sousaphone player was the first to go.
Next time I'm flying.
It's so much easier crawling in rhythm.
We just passed Boulder.
This peyote you found has confusing metaphors
She's a lot better looking than that stupid bunny with the battery.
We're getting closer—I smell hotdogs.
Let's make a deal. I'll stop humming Stars and Stripes Forever if you'll quit imitating a boombox.
I guess we're all that's left of the band.
I know, I know, but it's just such a catchy beat!
We are followed by rows and rows of the finest virtuosos, the cream of every famous band.
I wonder if all of this groveling will get us anywhere.
I don't know ... but I sure hope it's a football game!
I'm starting to think this isn't the Trump victory parade?
Told you there'd be a Macy's around here some place.
That mirage has great legs
If she weren't a mirage, she'd be marching in a straight line wouldn't she?
After 3 days the mirages get better.
Can we go back to the Kate Upton mirage?
They're probably just stuck at a red light.
I still think something good might come out of this.
Pretty good as mirages go.
So when we get to the stadium, I'll find some seats while you go to the concession stand and get two Buds and some hotdogs with relish and mustard.
March! March!March! Just one time I'd like to see her throw that damn thing in the air and catch it.
You said you love a parade.
Hey... She avoided those rocks didn't she?
Aren't you glad that Outward Bound has added some frills?
What kind of a band camp is this, Jerry?
Hear me out: There's no Dorothy, no Toto, no yellow bricks... I think we're in the wrong gig.
I'm beginning to regret signing up for the Marching Band.
this mirage is even better than the palm trees!
Ends of the earth? Wasn't that where we started?
You can stop saying, "hup, two, three, four."
Where are the 76 trombones she promised?
I guess following her blindly into oblivion wasn't such a great idea.
I was sure she'd lead us right to Macy's.
You are either out of step or you are crawling to the beat of a different drummer.
Who knew we'd be finalists in the AMAZING RACE!
No, you've got to lead with your right hand on the downbeat
He's got to be real. Mirages don't cross-dress.
Maybe joining the Amelia Earhart Marching Band wasn't such a good idea after all.
No, I don't love a parade. Do you love a parade?
How many more miles to burning man again?
Trust me. Any parade I'm a part of is guaranteed to rain.
We can't ask her anything. She's got the talking stick.
I'm pretty sure we'll make it by half-time.
I thought the plain was supposed to be fruited.
She had beans last night.
She's a female leader I felt I could really get behind.
Well, this parade has gone to hell.
Oh, yeah? Are the footprints a mirage, too?
This really wasn't what I had in mind when she said she'd lead us to the nearest watering hole.
Get rid of the tubas you said. We won't need them out here you said.
This is the one time i really wish it would rain on our Parade!
Does she realize halftime was 5 days ago?
OK, then ask your hallucination to slow down the pace.
I don't care if she is a mirage, this beats just lying around waiting for the inevitable....
It's her boots ... they are really made for walking.
I don't have the heart to tell her that we lost our last piccolo player two mirages ago.
Do YOU see a Macy's out here?
Hallucination!? Whatever, I'm motivated.
What’s a pheromone?
How do we explain this to our wives?
Epaulettes are so Seventies.
As mirages go, I prefer mine more classical.
Let's split after halftime.
Hey, you’re a survivor! When this parade started we were waay at the back.
You know, majorettes originated in the Rhineland, where young women performing at carnivals were called "Tanzmariechen" or Dance Mary's. Really interesting, huh?
It's the boots.
Don't you just love a parade?
That baton better have a GPS in it!
I'm a sucker for "76 Trombones"
This dry run isn't working.
So where are these 76 trombones?
When's halftime over?
I'm beginning to think we should have followed that guy playing the water glasses.
Your wife sure is a good sport about this!
I cant get the Notre Dame fight song out of my head.
I didn't want to say anything but I think she lost the beat back there where the buzzards ate the last of the percussion section.
"I can't say enough for this vantage point.'
Nice mirage, I guess, but my vote's still for an oasis.
It could be worse - we could be in the tuba section.
Music Man meets Ishtar is NOT a great concept.
I think we've shown enough spirit!
Saying to the ends of the earth was a bit brash.
They say it's all about 'the journey'.
I thought she'd pass the baton by now.
Everyone's demise should be preceded by a peppy Souza march.
I'm having some major hallucinations.
Choosing a grand marshal with no prior parade experience seemed like such a great idea.
Sorry. When I said: "Don't rain on my parade, I really didn't mean it.'
I'm seeing a downside to the Raiders move to Las Vegas
Now I can't get "76 Trombones" out of my head.
Come on. It's better than the island last week.
Much better than the lemonade stand hallucination.
A fork in which road?
It's worth it if we get season tickets.
I hear we are getting the band back together
Just keep putting one hand in front of the other...
"Did we miss the concession stand?"
Leading us to water, I knew that was a trumped-up story.
By God, she is wearing yellow panties!
We are never going to make it back for 3rd quarter.
Didn't she just miss a beat?
Never expected band boot camp to be so tough!
The whistling is the worst part.
Is it time we changed the mirage?
Everyone hates these long Super Bowl halftime shows
Remember when no one went to Brooklyn?
Let's never bet on an election again...
If she's a mirage how come she knows every Sousa march?
This is the last time we sign up for a reality TV show.
This beat is killing me.
If you tell me to follow the leader one more time I'm gonna hit both of you over the head with that baton.
I didn't vote for her, but she is a highly effective leader.
She's taking us to Hilary's victory party - she won the popular vote.
We're crawling in love.
Somewhere, we lost our 76 trombones.
Talk about hallucinations.
Well that's one way to keep our spirits up.
I wasn't planning on a recount either.
She said her father was a big shot in the town of Hamelin.
It's not a mirage, my wife always takes the lead.
I'd hate to walk 1000 miles in her shoes.
If we start seeing 76 trombones we're in real trouble!
Marches have gotten much more interesting since the Foreign Legion started accepting women.
What makes you think it's a mirage?
I didn't expect such a welcoming homecoming.
At least there's no traffic.
Damn, I just love a parade!
Forget water, I want a Cabinet post.
This parade route gets longer but there are fewer and fewer floats.
I don't care if it IS a mirage. I'm going.
I guess you never forget the skills you learn in band camp.
God, how I miss those porpoises.
It's not working. I still remember November 8th.
When does the greatness begin?
Just how cheap were these seats?
Should we tell her we lost our instruments about two miles back?
Boy, you weren't kidding when you said she marches to the beat of her own drummer!
This is the last time I'm letting you plan our vacation.
Who needs an oasis?
I think we might reconsider slavishly following the leader.
"Be unique", you said. "March to the beat of your own drummer", you said!
The good news...she doesn't know we are here.
I think the band went the other way.
"'Ya gotta admit, she has a nice butt".
Story of my life...
Location, location, location
Are we free of the establishment yet?
It must be halftime.
I always wanted to be in a mirage band.
At least I'll die happy.
OK, so we definitely overshot Herald Square.
We should have quit marching when we stopped hearing the tuba.
According to media reports she's leading a large band.
I don't hear it either. Do you think the auditory hallucinations have been delayed?
Told you it wasn't a mirage.
I finally know what it means to be led astray
We'll be fine until we get to his wall.
As mirages go, it's pretty unique.
I hate Sousa!
I'm definitely going to complain to the cruise line about this excursion!
I'm not sure being Secretary of State is worth this.
Looks like we are the last of the saints.
She is going to have to use the rest room eventually. We find the men's room next to it and drink water from the toilet and we survive!
Maybe we should stop making trumpet noises with our mouths.
The show must go on.
She won't be happy till our arms are in synch
They were right. It IS a long, long way to Tipperary.
Have any gum?
To be honest, I'd have preferred a Busby Berkeley hallucination.
I just assumed the flashy costume and air of confidence meant we were going somewhere good?
I know it's a death march, but aren't you curious if she drops the baton at the end?
He said she didn't have the stamina to lead.
Survival of the flutist.
I'm with her!
I'll follow a woman in a uniform anywhere.
We're finally second row!
My god I love parades!
Plus, we don't have to lug an instrument around.
So, what's your fetish?
She certainly has brightened up this death march, don't you think?
I'm hoping someone will rain on his parade.
I still say we made a bad turn at Albuquerque .
The vote was on Brexit, wasn't it?
I told you I would follow her anywhere.
Everybody loves a parade.
I told you we should have followed that turkey balloon instead of her.
I think we passed Macy's a few mirages ago.
You're sure this is homecoming weekend?
Mirage or not, it gives hope.
Trouble!" "Oh, we got trouble!!" "Right here in River City!" "Right here in River City!!" "With a capital "T" and that rhymes with "P" and that stands for...
Drum mirage-ette?
Things could be worse. Our mirage could have come with four legs.
Even though I'm technically the section lead, I want you to know I consider us equal partners on the team.
That promise to make us great again sounded good at the time.
I'm tellin' ya, the longer we wait the funnier the look on her face will be.
this is going nowhere, let's eat her !
I don't care if it IS a mirage. I love a parade.
So much for following a different drummer.
I know, but I like the view from here...
Best mirage ever!
You're a star, grab her like the Donald to make sure she's real!
I'm feeling it, I tell you. She's leading us to the promised land.
Confidence - it's everything.
You really have to appreciate her enthusiasm.
I think it's working. Looks like it may rain on our parade.
Maybe we shouldn't have followed Hillary!
Aren't you glad I got us bumped up to first class?
Halftimes have gotten totally out of control.
Water would be better, but the rhythm is nice.
It made so much sense four years ago.
Crawl to the beat or she'll make us start over.
Just think, a few more weeks of band camp and we'll be in the best shape of our lives.
I'm quite convinced this isn't the tail end of Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
It rarely pays to follow the other guy's dream.
Perhaps Hillary was more qualified after all.
Is this gag going somewhere?
The Trump victory celebration is still going in full force!
I miss the tubas.
Trust me, she's real.
Should we tell her we lost the elephant 12 miles ago?
She’s my mirage. You dream up the band.
Is it ME, or she hard to follow?
At first I thought it was a mirage, too.
River City seems to have dried up and blown away
Think of it this way- the parade started with 76 trombones.
This parade could use some rain.
You're right. I do hear the drums.
"The band can't be far behind".
All these miles and we still haven't got the rhythm!
You do realize we could have just followed him on Facebook, right?
So we clapped at Hamilton.Was that so bad?"
Can't you keep in step?
I take her seriously, but not literally.
We shouldn't have chosen "Stairway to Heaven."
Did you vote for trump too?
Gosh, I love a parade.
I'd prefer marching to my own drummer.
Mirage?. I thought I was in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
Macy's Day is a real disappointment this year, huh.
At some point she's gotta pass the baton!
I heard if you crawl, you get twice the step counts.
It was a great idea to dump the sousaphones.
She's leading us to the source of accurate news.
Nice miraging there, Lou.
Are you sure that's a divining rod she's carrying
Well, you must admit she has a certain "je ne sais quoi"!
Before this, she ran Trump's campaign.
What men will do for for a a good-looking pair of legs!
I forget. Is she our carrot or our stick?
At least it's not raining on our parade.
If she can't find Professor Harold Hill for us, no one can.
It must be halftime.
I never took you seriously that if TRUMP won, we would march to Mexico.
I miss the trumpets.
Maybe this is why she got drummed out of town.
I think its time we switch parties...
I'm an optimist, Tom. I say the desert is half full.
Don't give up. I'm pretty sure it's going to be great again real soon...
Percussion deserted us.
Sure, I'm thirsty, but who cares?
Yessiree....Jill Stein is the one to fix this in 2020!
You may see a lake but I have a different need
Stamina is highly overrated.
I think we've carried this "marching to a different drummer" thing too far.
We follow her to the sideline and then it's Gatorade!
Yes, I'm still with her.
And the band crawled on.
Someone should rain on this parade asap.
I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
I sure hope this turns out to be a good idea.
It's not the best view... but at least we get to see a parade.
More like marching SAND, am I right??
She might be a mirage, but she knows where she's going.
Ain't been so bad since the tuba player dropped.
If you knew Sousa ........
This is going to be great.
she seems to know where we`re going
When do we start feeling great again?
Bark one more time and I'll kill you.
Of all the drum majorettes in the world, we fall in love with the Energizer Bunny!
Maybe we were told"fall behind" , not "crawl behind".
Hey, at least we got Team Spirit!
I'm having second thoughts about this parade route.
I call this the homecoming mirage.
I vowed, 'To honor and obey.' What's your excuse?
Because sooner or later, it'll rain on a parade.
I'm still praying for when the saints go marching in.
Sure she has a cute rear end, but this is getting ridiculous.
Does she know that we want it to rain on her parade?
I feel bad for dropping my tuba.
These halftime shows are getting longer and longer.
I like your mirage more than mine.
I followed Trump in '16 and, ironically, it turned out a lot like this, too.
"I followed because I love a parade! What's your excuse?
At least we wont die of boredom.
I call it the Trail of Cheers.
Marching to a different drummer has its drawbacks.
Anyway her enthusiasm is inspirational
I-i-i-i love a parade!...
That's the last time I bet on an election.
This is nothing to where The Donald will lead us.
I'm beginning to think she's a little off key.
Are you sure she knows the way to the oasis?
What if she's a mirage leading us to a mirage?
Isn't this more fun than using the GPS device to get to Pasdena??
We do a dry run before the parade.
If a majorette comes, can beer be far behind?
The tubas fell back about a mile ago.
It kills me that I forgot my tuba.
She won't stop until the band is back together.
NOW she shows up!
I wish she'd let us twirl the baton once in a while.
This parade is making me thirsty.
If we're going to follow her, can't you at least crawl at the right rhythm?
I thought her enthusiasm was supposed to be infectious.
It's okay, we are with the band.
I love a parade, Don't you?
If we'd have followed those damn' trombones, we'd be in River City by now
Since when did Moses wear high heels and a skirt?
Somehow this doesn't seem as delusional as pleading with the rock.
Death Valley needed a bit of animation to attract tourists.
Maybe we shouldn't have signed up to be Trumpettes?
Are you SURE this is the way to the promised land?...cause I am really thirsty
My wife suffers from water retention.
Maybe next time we should follow the band
Maybe the water boy will be along next.
Im starting to think there may not be a Santa float.
I think I'm starting to hallucinate...it looks like there's a man crawling right next to me!
Now you sing - oh when the saints. It's not that difficult.
My commitment to follow her anywhere is wearing thin.
At this point I would score eight for Style and two for Direction.
You know, this mirage is much better than the water mirage that we saw fifty miles ago.
What's not to love?
Maybe we were marching to the beat of the wrong different drummer.
You're the one who said we should march to a different drummer; big mistake!
I could think of worst mirages.
Wasn’t there a Snoopy float last year?
You think you're tired. I've been in this band for five years!
I'm first trumpet now!
And you had to go and mouth off about her lack of stamina!
So where the hell are those seventy-six trombones?
She promised to get us there by opening kickoff!!!
If you think this is good just wait til the halftime show!
I warned you that she marched to the beat of a distant drummer!
It's not easy being a Hillary cheerleader.
Who cares if she's lying about the waterfall and the oasis - she's a great leader.
Who got her a Fitbit?
Nice ass
I used to love a parade but those days are long gone.
We've gotta stay upbeat.
Did you say drum or dumb?
Doreen is a natural leader. She just has to improve her situational awareness.
Rain prance.
We have to stand up. She started singing the Star Spangled Banner.
Hey, at least we are going out in style.
I didn't think the Dust Bowl parade would be so long.
I'm worried that our fearless leader has no idea where we're going.
Everybody loves a parade, but not as much as we do, right?
I'm just saying that if it's a mirage, it's at least an inspiring one.
I-I-I-I-I -- love a parade!
Are you sure the genie didn't think you asked for a leader, as opposed to a liter?
I meant follow him on Twitter....
The view is definitely better from here.
Since Palin '08, I find boots irresistible. What's your excuse.
I was relieved someone else shares this fetish
Whaddaya mean you don't love a parade?
My agent said think Lawrence of Arabia.
It's left/right in unison.
So, you steal the baton--how does that help us?
The rest of the band deserted her miles ago.
Think this is what it’s like following a populist demagogue?
Stop talking or we'll never get a water break.
This better end in something better than just a mirage.
And you said Fantasy Cheerleader Camp would be so fun.
I told you to pick the camel instead!
We should have followed the tuba player!
We should have brought a GPS instead!
Just this once. What if it DID rain?
At least we don't have to worry about stadium parking.
I see why Barbells with Betsy was 80 percent off on Groupon.
Yessir, I'd go to the ends of the earth for her.
Her band has deserted her
I think we went to high school together.
When do we get to see Santa?
Do you see what I see?
See! I told you she is wearing panties.
She makes me feel guilty for putting down my tuba.
She works at The Mirage.
Technically to be considered a parade, we'd have to be marching, too.
Looks like it's only halftime.
She can lead us to water but she can't make us drink.
When we reach the stadium it's beer and hotdogs.
I never heard 'Midnight at the Oasis' in a marching band style before.
Can you believe she got cut from cross country?
We are on our way to Macy's, right?
Who loves a parade more than us?
Do you think that the mirages are getting crazier?
The show must go on.
I don't care what gender it is as long as it leads us to water.
Makes more sense than the Tabasco truck you had us follow.
She's making the desert great again.
It's the different drummer.
Too bad there's only one more mile to go.
How long is this halftime show?
The lake was a bust, but no complaints about this mirage.
What part of "follow me" did we misunderstand?
Except for the knobby knees, this mirage gets a 10.
Are we getting close to Pasadena yet?
You're right. It is just like high school.
I don't know, I dialed 911 and this is what they sent
Halftime seems like a lifetime ago.
Jeez, can't she do anything slower than 2/2 time?
Geez. By now I'd thought I'd be more thirsty than horny.
You're dragging behind the beat, Ken.
It's my mirage and I'll say Drum Majorette if I want...
I thought you told me he was going to make America great again!
No, really, she's better than a GPS.
We need to keep following her. She's the drum major for the Niagara Falls High School band.
Gosh, I love a parade.
This is the only way to sneak into Canada.
I am starting to think she was over-confident.
The leader of the sand
Lucky for you I have "Fall off your Float" Road Service!
When I said I'd follow her to the ends of the earth I didn't mean with her ex husband.
Do you think she has noticed us yet ?
We crawl to the beat of a different drum majorette.
One time, at band camp...
That baton looked a lot like a water divining rod......
Where did we lose the band?
She gave the signal for Allegro. Quicken the pace.
When you said you'd follow her anywhere, did you have any idea?
Because Moses didn't have a baton.
This is the first parade in my honor.
Halftime is almost over.
We seemed to have lost the rest of the band
Yeah? Well, I think she's a LOUSY water diviner.
You're the one who fell for the "I'm a direct descendant of Moses" line.
I hope the halftime show is worth it.
If you start singing "I Love a Parade" one more time, I will strangle you.
I can't keep in step anymore
But would she follow you anywhere?
Me? I started in high school, and I think I'll be at first base with her soon.
Because it's shiny!
I really wish we had followed a different drum majorette.
I say we give her two more dunes, max.
Do you think she'll notice we're out of step?
I'm really tired of your humming, " When the Saints Go Marching On".
Bob, let's not ever - EVER - audition for a crummy community production of 'Music Man' again!
Do you think we can talk her into using that stick as a dowsing rod
I guess we're already dead, but who cares?
She blew in my ear, and you?
Mirage? I thought you were following your instincts.
I lost my glockenspiel.
I think her candidacy led us astray
Nice, but now pretend you're the Grand Marshal and we have a convertible to ride in.
all in all, i say she's the best mirage we've seen yet.
I think your wife is mocking us.
Tune in for next season's Survivor: Extreme Band Camp
I'm marching to a different drummer.
We should have followed the elephants.
I still see a pool of water. You?
If you can't get the timing right, you are going to get the baton, again. Keep up.
You've got to admit her leadership qualities really are second to none.
Are you sure this guy is Bedouin?
It's never going to rain on this parade.
Are you sure this is the parade that gets rained on?
I wish someone would rain on this parade already.
At least we won't have to stop and ask for directions.
Thank God SHE knows where we're going.
This is the strictest band I've ever been in.
It's possible I have been too quick to dismiss the importance of school spirit.
She must do crossfit.
Maybe we should have tried out for the football team instead?
Now this is a long, strange trip.
Why? I'm a leg man.
I'm just grateful the mirage tuba fell off me a few miles ago.
Why are we following her again?
Did she say 76 trombones or 76 miles?
And 40 years ago there were 76 Trombones.
You know, she's beginning to look like Major-eat.
Yes, I've seen "Animal House." Why?
Are you sure she's a dominatrix?
Faster, men and rats. The pestilence is almost upon us. The America that's Great Again is just over this cliff. Trust me !
I've always loved a parade
She comes with alumni parking.
Hope it rains on this parade!
If we start hearing music, we're goners.
There's just something about the way she moves.
I hear she's married to a tall drink of water
What happened to the crowds?
Much better than that cliche' oasis mirage.
Hey ! I think I can see Macy's !
Wasn't the parade supposed to end at Sepulveda?
They really drag out the half-time show for commercials.
I'm starting to think there is no water.
Don't complain, she got us great seats on the 50 yard line.
Should we tell her that we already passed our house?
She did say Simon Says, didn't she?
What did we exactly sign up for...?
I hear it's down to me and one other guy to replace her
We're certainly marching to a different drummer
Carl, you seriously need to upgrade your GPS service.
for our next group vision let's have a pastry chief
I really don't care if she is a he, it is the only thing keeping me going.
If it wasn't for her, I'm SURE we'd be out of step by now...
We just have to hang on a little longer. I was told it leads to an orange bowl.
Maybe we'll find those 76 trombones.
If this were a metaphor, wouldn't we be being led astray rather by a Trump-eter?
Your not going to believe this
It must be her pheromones.
The marching band takes hazing a little too far
She's always marched to a different drummer.
We should've had a safe word.
I'll stand up when she sings the national anthem.
I don't think we're going to find your contact.
''This is going to get old.''
Hey, what happened to the band?
This seemed like a good idea at first.
She says her last gig was shepherding a cadre of lemmings.
Next time I'll be more specific when asking a genie for March Madness tickets.
If this is a mirage, it's a doozy.
I can't imagine where this is all leading to.
I'm going to miss Obama's immigration policies.
Mac, if life is about chasing a dream, then we deserve that drink.
Do you think she has a boyfriend?
I think her last name is Pelosi.
OK, go back and follow that rock if you'd rather.
Sure, we're dying of thirst... But what a way to go!
Just between us guys, the accommodations suck but the view is outstanding.
As mirages go, this one leads the band!
Drum Major or Drum Mirage, she got us this far...
We've come this far, we can't desert her now.
I'm beginning to think she's a mirage.
Hey, get in step!
Did she say she was a drum major or a drum mirage?
I told you, her legs take you places
To me, she sure looks like one long drink of water.
These NCAA sanctions are really getting ridiculous.
So your line in the sand is if she asked you to jump off a bridge?
It looks like we made it to halftime.
We said we’d follow her anywhere.
With this kind of leadership, it's the journey, not the destination, that matters
I never saw myself as a follower before today
I thought you were the different drummer.
Once in a while, I think I see a flash of panties!
You have a better idea?
Does she know she veered off the parade route?
You'd think she would have noticed when the band stopped playing.
They don't make mirages like they used to.
She lied about stopping in Pasadena.
I've run out of Sousa marches to whistle. How else can we keep going?
Yep, Trump says follow her... greatness is up ahead.
This marching band try-out is brutal.
I ate my tuba an hour ago.
I think the parade is over, but what the heck, let's keep singing 'Go Cubs Go.'
Can you still hear hear the band?
Bob, your cadence is all off, now we have to start over.
"Well, at least we've got the Cirque Désolé to entertain us.
When can we say we've given her enough of a chance?
Isn't it time to pass the baton?My knees are killing me.
This is one messed up mirage.
I can't wait till halftime is over.
It's time we take the battery out of this energizer bunny, John.
Do you think she really knows the way?
Macy's parade has got to be right around the corner.
can we do the mirage with the water now please
Are you SURE this is how Macy's got started?
The alumni newsletter did promise an extended half-time show.
My hemorrhoids are killing me.
Are you sure she's leading us to water?
How much longer are you going to keep following Hillary for ?
OK, double or nothing says she drops that baton in the next hour.
I have this reoccurring dream that I am crawling through a desert following the Pied Piper." "Funny, me too!
How much longer are we going to on with this charade ?
At least the view from here is nice.
She must be running on Duracell's.
Those boots were made for walking.
These better be some awesome seats.
I'm beginning to have my doubts that she is a water dowser.
I'd settle for 75 trombones.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
Follow the optomistic one you said
Well, God bless America!
She has a lousy sense of direction.
She either has superb balance--or her battery's run out.
It's got to rain on our parade soon.
I can't believe I forgot my glockenspiel.
Did she blow in your ear, too?
Sometimes, I really wonder if she knows where she's going.
No peeking if she drops the baton
The practices are grueling, but the refreshments at the end are great.
Good girl, Lassie, good girl!! (Didn't she have four legs this morning?)
Follow her," you said. "She knows where to go.
Macy's Parade?! I think her GPS turned off at Madison Avenue!
In a better hallucination she'd be holding a divining rod!
She may be just a mirage, but I'd follow those legs anywhere.
Of course she's nuts. But she does have an aura of certainty I find very appealing in these uncertain times.
Should we tell him the band died an hour ago?
I'm beginning to think this is a mirage.
We'll get relief at halftime.
I'm getting a funny feeling that following this leader will get us nowhere.
I'm with the band
Think she can really lead us to Starbucks?
Is she wearing thongs in your hallucination too?
It's the longest halftime I've ever been involved in.
When's day 40?
Thank goodness we lost the tubas back at Burning Man...
Do you think we've reached ten million steps yet?
She's gotta be from the Baton Death Marching Band.
Well if this don't beat the band!
I'm beginning to think we're no longer marching straight to victory.
Was this what they meant by marching to a different drummer?
She seemed so confident...
What do you say now, Mr. Don't-rain-on-my-parade?
Band. I said I wanted to be in the band.
It would have been easier to make the football team
Maybe marching to the beat of your own drum is a little overrated.
I don't mind the crawling so much, but I kind of wish she would change up the tune a little more frequently.
OK, we’re not the lead dogs, but the view isn’t so bad.
I'm starting to think that's not a good dousing rod.
Somehow I'm not thirsty anymore. I told you, nobody rains on her parade!
I don't know how she does it either, but I'm following her until 2020.
She's going to make America great again.
This is the longest half time march I can remember.
She said it gets easier when the seasons change.
With those thighs I'd follow her anywhere.
This is much more intimate than Burning Man.
I've always been a fool for a baton.
This is so much better than that underwater yoga class.
I never thought it would end this way.
She said she knew where there was an oasis.
Don't you know the difference between a mirage and an oasis??
I knew I should have brought my trombone.
This is the most existential CrossFit I've tried yet.
I hope it's a mirage.
You can find just about anything on Craigslist.
I should have double checked our parade permits.
I hope this Majorette gets us Majorwet real soon.
If you think she knows where she’s going, where’s the rest of her band?
We could get a cab.
So is this what they meant when encouraging us to take the path less traveled?
Hey, you're right! Just following along without thinking is so much easier than reality.
How'd we miss the band?
Why didn't she strike that rock with her stick, like Moses did, and get us some water?
I finally got it. It's left leg planted and right arm free!
This is so much better than following a sled dog.
She puts the "star" in starvation.
If I don't make it, tell them I died with a smile on my face.
I like to think that I crawl to the beat of a different drummer.
Ok I give up- you can be first trombone.
Getting stuck behind a parade always makes me feel like I'm going to die.
Really? I voted for Trump, too!
I thought she was gonna stop at the edge of town.
She will have to stop when we reach the horizon.
Yes, I know she's crazy, but I still say she marches to the beat of her own drummer.
It's only us flute players left, bro. Everyone else fell off long ago.
It's called performance art.
Who knows why Siri sent the local twirling champ, but at least Apple maps avoided the rock outcrop.
She marches to a different drummer.
Crawl right or get out of the parade.
Some grand marshal *you* turned out to be.
What happened to the 76 trombones?
I'm beginning to think she is just a mirage!
Make her rain on this parade.
I don't mind waiting for a drink of water. I just want to see the rest of the band!
What is it about women with batons that makes me grovel?
I know your mirage is shimmering, but is it also high stepping?
He's to hoping this parade gets rained on.
For the good old days of waterboarding.
I'm really glad I dropped my tuba back there.
Things could be worse, given the pomp and circumstances.
I think we march to the tune of a different drummer.
Somehow, I think we've lost the parade route ....
She's marching to the sound of a different drummer
This is not what she had in mind for her inaugural parade.
I used to love a parade!
Ya know what, Bullwinkle? This is the best mirage I've seen all week.
Guess we have our marching orders.
I'll take this over a GPS any day.
She's cute, but this isn't the parade route
I hear she's besties with the Energizer Bunny.
Doncha just love a parade?!
This is what we get for following the wrong person in the desert for the last 40 years.
I'm thinking the whole Rain/Parade thing is a metaphor
I know it's an hallucination - the best one we've had so far - and what do we have to lose!?!
Thirty years in marching band. You?
We've been drummed out.
I always wanted to be in a parade!
Did we pick the wrong leader?
Beware the Ides of March
So, what exactly is a mirage?
Now aren't you glad we took the scenic route?
She makes me feel alive again.
Are we completely sure this isn't a mirage?
Remember. We promised to follow her to the ends of the earth
You'll have to excuse her. My mother's a little dramatic about everything.
How does the Bataan Death March end again?
All I said was, "I'd follow you anywhere."
I think we've been following a mirage.
It still beats flying.
Instead of using the "Rescue App" on your phone maybe you should have just called 911.
I thought you said we were auditioning for the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade?
Back off, she's mine.
Will you stop singing "Don't Rain On My Parade"!
40 years more and they'll write Bible passages about us.
Even as a kid I hated parades.
See? I told you these Arizona Sun Devil Half-Time shows are something else !
I'm tired, hungry and thirsty, but just look at her twirl!
You had to yell 'Freebird,' didn't you?
Guess they really cut back on this year's Thanksgiving Day parade....
I told you that you would see things differently if you drank the koolaid!
"I hate to disillusion you, but I really don't think this is the Macy's parade.
Well don't mess up the cadence now.
These Macy's parades get longer every year.
I've been following her since the 2012 Thanksgiving Day Parade.
By the time we get to Phoenix she’ll be crawling…la di dah dah...
I've just about had it with this its the journey, not the detination crap.
Just you wait, we're gonna get a couple of cushy factory jobs.
She's the leader, and we're her parching band...
I wish he remembered his pantaloons
Where is that wall when you need it?
Hey, I guess I missed it. When did we lose the 76th trombonist?
Follow her. Pasadena, New Year's Day. Guaranteed.
I keep reminding myself that the path of progress has never taken a straight line.
...And where do you say you bought the GPS?
Maybe not to water but to a heck of a football game
No idea, but wherever it is she'll make a great first impression.
So when did she say she gets her water break again?
I think we should've stayed to the left back there.
It's not exactly the way I expected making the desert great again.
Are you sure this is the way to the stadium?
I'm a white, blue collar worker - how about you?
It's a pity the rest of the band couldn't keep up. I had to eat the flutist to make it this far.
I'm starting to lose the tempo.
Her name is Marian. I hope we're headed for River City, where she ran the library.
The part I'm upset about is that we've only reached halftime.
Presidential inaugurations aren't what they used to be.
TGIF
These mirages keep getting weirder.
Trust me. If there's one thing I know about marching bands, it's that they love water.
It just hasn't been the same since we lost the glockenspiel player.
Are we getting nearer to the reviewing stand?
Told you not to follow Hillary.
I don,t care mirage or not,she,s got great legs.
Maybe she can-can, but I can't-can't.
Tell me, when did you drop your instrument?
I hate to rain on your parade but we made a wrong turn at Albuquerque
These band camp hikes really give you a workout!
What have we got to lose?
Do you think if we keep following her we'll find the tailgate parties?
It figures -- the mirage is wearing Spanx.
These halftimes take forever.
Keep going . . . she promised us a part in the Macy's parade.
Next time, let's try marching to the beat of a different drum leader.
You see Larry, I told you she'd lead us to Burning Man
I also marched to my own drummer when I was young!
Please tell me she knows where the water is.
How much in pledges per mile did you get for the band uniform fundraiser?
Yes, she is fun to follow but there are limits!
I love a parade, but where's the finish line?
Crawl faster; we have to get to Pasadena by New Year's.
'Once we're back on campus, we can change and get a bite to eat.'
And the band played on
Are you sure you want to keep following Trump's program?
Remind me again why we chose the ceremonious dismissal.
Definitely, my kind of Pied Piper!
I've heard hallucinations lead to dehydration.
And here I am without my trombone, darnit!
I could use a drink, but the entertainment selection is better than expected.
I think she's confused my pounding heart and wheezing for a drum and a bagpipe.
It's motivating sure, but i'm more interested in water-based mirages
She's got gorgeous gams, that's why.
Are you sure that this is the way to the Rose Parade?
You gotta love her enthusiasm !
I think we've got trouble right here in No River City.
You're out of crawl again.
Gimme a W! Water! Water!
You're getting warmer.
And I thought my sarge in Basic Training was tough.
I said booster club, but it was your bright idea to join the marching band.
Band leader? More like 'Sand Leader,' am I right?
So the survivor gets WHAT again?
We're back to "gams" again, I think we have covered all the terms for legs we could think of.
Simon says...STOP!
No wonder why it never rains on her parade.
Naw... you're halicinating. The 76 trombones fell out a long time ago!
If I told you what I saw, you would't even believe me.
I love how Burning Man is so anti-establishment. Like, I feel so free right now.
At least the water mirage is less annoying!
So what if she's a mirage? I've always been a sucker for a parade.
We should probably be traveling single file to hide our numbers.
This might be fun if we hadn't dropped our instruments 9 hours ago.
I'd like to think she's leading us out of our national nightmare, but there's no denying that this is the way to the Trump Las Vegas Hotel.
Have you ever heard of the Pied Piper of Hamelin? I just have a feeling that this isn't going to end well...
No charismatic leader has steered me wrong yet.
Back when the parade first started, she said her name is Hillary.
Hey Harvey, get back in step.
Find your own random marching woman in the desert to crawl after, you glory seeking bastard.
I told you they'd divert the parade away from Trump Tower
She's as lost as we are, but I choose to follow her out of bitterness and frustration.
Too bad we ditched the tubas.
Enough with the zig zagging.
and the beat goes on
No, those are not 'Go-Go boots', but they do evoke certain memories.
Too bad the waterboy was a mirage.
I think I see the Budweiser horses in the distance.
This must be that swamp he drained.
And she looks so real.
We should have made a left when the 76th trombone collapsed.
No, its better than a mirage.
Trumps inauguration parade... "I didn't vote for him..."
She hardly sweats at all
Can we stop at the next rest area, I really gotta go!
We should have just followed him on Facebook.
Yep, he won.
There were seventy-six of us and now not a single trombone can be heard.
Halftime . Hot dog?
Slowly it's dawning on me. "I'd follow that butt anywhere" may have its drawbacks.
No, wait until we get to Rockefeller Center. She'll never see us escape through all those people.
What drought?
Things could be worse.
I don't think it is a mirage.
I have a good feeling about this. Before long, she'll lead us right to Macy's.
It can't be a mirage. We just crossed the 50 yard line.
I'm beginning to think we should have stopped following her at that last town.
Lately I've felt that my life has more direction.
I told you this was the wrong bandwagon.
This way to make America great again!
Baton death march? Phooey! This ain't so bad.
I'm on the verge of total consciousness. Thanks Burning Man.
HOW MUCH LONGER BEFORE WE SEE DONALD TRUMP?
I know that tune. Do you remember the lyrics?
How far is it toTipperary?
Don't worry -- this causes rain every time.
That's the new FitBit Drum-Major Baton model.
At this point, we can't be picky.
Yeah, I could follow her for 40 years.
NOW do you regret saying Majorettes aren't tough enough for The Foreign Legion??
She's been trying to log more steps on Fitbit
At least this way we're not stuck in traffic getting to the big game
Looks like the 2020 election is starting
This is the longest halftime show I've ever been in.
I understand why you want to stop, but this one time at band camp...
At least one of us was properly hydrated.
A pub crawl gone horribly wrong.
What if she doesn't know the territory?
You and your River City
The baton doubles as a divining rod.
Maybe it did say Band Practice
Does this mirage make sense to you?
Keep it up! I heard that at mile three, she starts scattering candy!
I don't understand why Trump thinks this will defeat ISIS.
Did she blow in your ear, too?
This show is really good - 40 years passed so quickly.
Just remember, if Cabeza de Vaca could do it, so can we.
Are you sure that's a dowsing rod she's carrying?
I hate to think that we're missing the game.
Now I know how the economy feels
She's from Ohio State
I wish she'd stop long enough for me to ask for her phone number.
You know Hank, I'm starting to wonder if that's a dowsing rod.
Just a reminder, you were the one who said "It'll be fun. You love parades".
I really think Hillary still has a chance!
we lost the marching band three miles ago.
Just remember, when we get through this, we'll make more than she does.
She's the top-rated personal trainer in Albuquerque
Pretty soon it's gonna rain on her parade.
I'd say we were committed, not stupid.
So where's this bandwagon you mentioned?
What's her secret?
Damn! I was hoping for a mirage.
When can we pass the baton?
When the band disappeared, we should have figured she's what's left of the mirage.
May it rain on her parade!
Last year we had to go over the boulders
Geez this is a long halftime show...
Not sure...but ya gotta love a parade!
Who's idea was it to follow this idiot?
Something around here is a mirage.
I voted for him, but pledging undying support is taking it too far.
And this is due to climate change?
How far you going, friend?
Helen's mother was a majorette and her father was a saguaro.
I told you she has no sense of direction!
We were at halftime of the greatest football game ever, and now we're here. She's good--she's very good.
She's like this until it snows
Can't you find something more uptempo on your iPhone?
Sure she's a hallucination, but whenever she led the band it rained.
Uh-oh, I can hear the different drummer she's marching to.
#feminism
I know we're not on 34th Street anymore, but I don't care.
She had me, with just one twirl, at mile one.
With luck we should get free seats on the fifty.
We just have to make it through halftime and then we can take a water break.
I just wanted to save the Serengeti, not march the whole thing
We gotta be nearing Main Street.
No matter how lost you feel, there's always someone more lost than you.
She is the very model of modern Majorette.
George, did you call Uber?
Where there's halftime, there's hope!
Trump's presidency didn't work out so well, but damn it's been entertaining.
Don't look at me I voted for the libertarian party
Are we the only ones left from the big parade? Where did the 76 trombones go?
She doesn't look thirsty.
I'm happy she finally decided on her major.
All I said was, "Blow in my ear and..."
How much longer till we're out of Trump's territory?
Don't blame me, I voted third party!
They told me the county was dry, but this is rediuculous!
Best Secretary of Energy ever.
Actually, a swamp would be welcome about now.
I was afraid that rain forecast might affect the turnout.
We were a 300 strong band. Then one Saturday halftime the director made us perform a tribute to the French Foreign Legion.
Who thought anyone could make this part of America great again?
Nice boots.
We'll pick up some reeds at the next oasis.
Maybe there will be water at the tailgate.
She's a Trump supporter.
Marching to a different drummer has always distinguished her from the crowd.
Great legs!
Well, what exactly did you think it would be like to follow a baton death marching band on its summer tour?
The joy is in the journey!
Can you hum anything other than Sousa's "Double Time Crawl?"
Why, yes...I voted for Trump, too.
Following a narcissist never work out well in the end
She walks to the beat of a different drummer.
She's incredible, the other 98 band members died 200 miles ago.
I really don't believe she's going to deliver us from evil.
It's unanimous, EVERYONE loves a parade!
What happened to the script with "rows and rows of the finest virtuos?"
I am crawling to beat the band!
I'm starting to feel proud of my thirst.
We must be getting close to Gatorade.
Didn't I tell you this was leading us nowhere!
Her routine is a wee long, but I give her high marks for poise and commanding her audience.
No. We tried the 'following Hillary blindly' thing and it didn't work then either.
Well, at least we don't have to sing "76 Trombones."
You're such a follower.
Her cateen must have had electrolytes.
Always loved a parade
The lengths men go to, just to take a peek!
This is the guy you said would make the desert great again?
She's all attitude.
Maybe the fact that he's not wearing pants should have been a clue.
No wait... don't forget Leap Day.... 1,461.....
Majorette-whipped sounds better to the readers of this magazine.
I can't believe our luck - I've always wanted to be in a parade!
Thirst is a hoax too, right?
Do you think she'll get us there for the halftime show?
It's true what they say about those boots
Most days, I'm glad that she's still out here, front-&-center - but then, I sometimes really miss the tuba section, and the drums...
You're a little pitchy, Larry.
We should have stuck with the Macy's Parade- at least they have balloons
OK, I take it back - raining on my parade isn't the absolute worst thing you've ever done.
It's no rainbow but do you have a better idea?
Maybe we should've followed that map instead.
MUCH better than Trump!
Where are the trombones?
I'm just glad to be part of the parade
I think we left the parade route a long time ago.
The greatness is going to start really soon, I promise.
The ménage a trois personal ad was miss-leading.
I think I'm finally feeling the Bern.
How the hell does she keep marching along in high heel boots?
So what if it's a mirage? Eventually it will get us to Times Square.
Don't worry, there's a Starbucks right around the corner.
You know, those boots would look really good on me.
At least we didn't follow Trump, Wonder where he ended up?
This is no time for an erection.
Theresa's Brexit plan may not be ideal, but it's what we've got!
You're not gonna find ME sassing the Band Director again.
I wish she'd just give us some hint of which of us she prefers!
What did I tell you? A shift to the right was coming.
It's easier on the knees.
You're right. The scenery never changes.
Sure I love em, but right now a glass of water is on the top of my list.
John Philip Who-sa?
It's the only way to visit the new Trump Dubai hotel without the Democrats seeing me.
So far it doesn't rain on her parade.
All in all, it was preferable being a lemming.
Last one to the mirage is a rotten egg!!
It will be worth it when we hear the 76 trombones.
What trombones?
...and she's going to build a wall and make Muslims register and get us our jobs back and make sure we get clean drinking water!
Macy's. . . . Shmaycy's. . . . .Enough, already!
I don't think you should feel guilty for wanting to rain on her parade.
Somehow, it seems this marching to a different drummer has taken an unexpected turn.
Her leadership skills were a mirage after all.
I knew we shouldn't have made that bet.
I guess she hasn't showered, either.
I'm just dying for a glockenspiel right now.
Any regrets on taking up the tuba?
I know it is a fantasy, but I just can't keep my eyes off her.
What?! I thought you said she was a 'sand'leader.
I was the 77th trombone.
I have my doubts, too. But at least we know she's not a Washington insider.
The last guy dropped out hours ago. You got any idea what we're playing for ?
I have to give it to her, she maintains good form.
The parade looks a lot better on television.
I'm banking that she will get thirsty at some point, or another.
See what happens when you miss an A flat?
If she is a mirage, why does her uniform smell so bad?
I used to follow a "different drummer".
Maybe "going rogue" isn't all it's cracked up to be.
What did you THINK was going to happen on The Parade of Death Adventure?
Why not a left at the rock?
Boots. Short skirt. Authority. Catchy beat. I'd follow her anywhere.
It's the legs.
She almost makes dying of thirst fun.
Well, there was Moses, but I'm a contrarian.
I'd prefer if she just said, "I told you so."
Ideology is a bitch.
We should never have gotten the band back together.
The last thing I remember we were in the Macy's parade and took a wrong turn at 42nd Street!
Let's shoot for a shorter parade route next year.
I thought this was supposed to be a quick march?
Must be the Red Bull.
I can't wait to hear the music that goes with this!
She's going to make America great again.
This is starting to remind me of that other guy we followed blindly. You remember don't you, that Trump guy?
I can't believe she's real this time.
on the other hand it does help to keep our homosexual impulses in check.
All this to win first chair tuba.
I think she' leading us to Trumpland
He promised to make America great again.
How much longer till Macy's?
Okay, so what's YOUR fantasy?
Did you click "Follow" too?
I'm starting to think she doesn't have a clue where the end of the parade route is.
I don't remember playing Death Valley U last year. Do you?
You wouldn't think the acoustics out here would be this good, but, I've been wrong before!
I don't know what's worse. The callouses on my knees, or the fact there's no music playing.
I do admire how she keeps a beat.
Anybody but Trump! Are you sure?
If this is Trump U.'s marching band, I'd hate to see the football team. #Sad
Is it just me or does it seem like we’re going too far out of our way for a half-time show?
This must be halftime, right?
So we clapped at Hamilton.Was that so bad?"
Apparently no one has ever finished this marathon before!
Tell me again. Why does the Cubs victory parade need to be a metaphor?
Who needs water?
I've always wanted to be in a marching band.
Why are we following her again?
She is so damned followable.
I already feel great again.
She is going to be so disappointed
Weren't there supposed to be seventy six trombones and a hundred and ten coronets?
I thought she'd stop when I ditched the glockenspiel.
Getting on this Trump bandwagon may be even harder than we thought.
Actually, I don't think I'd object to naysayers raining on this particular parade any more.
I hear they charge $6 for a bottle of water.
I wish you had suggested that earlier.
I love a parade, Don't you?
I'd prefer a mirage of a water boy...
I wish we would have followed the chap who was jumping off that bridge.
We're a little marching band, so we have to show the judges we have a lot of heart.
Just another boring Monday, I thought - what have I got to lose?
Ready for the second half?
We are on the right path... I feel it.
The ones who marched didn't last too long.
I'm starting to think we should have followed a different beat.
This will get us out of having to go to the parade next year.
'I'm with her, but I think we should have stayed longer in the Midwest.
I'm not sure where she's taking us but she can sure carry a tune, huh?
I don't care, Jim. One of these times that leg lift is going to mean she is peeing, and I'm gonna be ready.
I guess women do have more stamina.
When did you crawl on the bandwagon?
She seems to know where she's going!
The goal line can't be far.
The competition for drum major is out of hand. Let's give it to her.
Sure it's a mirage, but you gotta love that De Souza music!
You and I travel to the beat of a different drum majorette.
I wish Macy's still hosted
Hey, at least this one didn't use a private email server.
And you thought that we were the only ones losing it!
He's to hoping this parade gets rained on.
We should have traveled to a different beat.
For next year's parade I'll bring my knee guard.
I never want Hillary's victory parade to end.
So help me, from now on no more of that "different drummer" nonsense.
"Rommel's granddaughter".
I know this is only boot camp but i don't think we are cut out for the drum and bugle corps.
There's just something Trumpian about her.
Don't be a baby. Just keep crawling.
I didn't know they had Macy's out this way, Herb.
Whathappened to the band wagon?
When is she going to lead you to drink?
How much should we tip?
Who cares if she's missing the beat?
Hey, I just saw her underpants."
You still think we are on the right side of history?
Remind me. Why do we follow people who carry maces and stick feathers in their cap?
She took the long way around that rock. We should say something.
When you said "Rescue Party", I had something else in mind!
If you remembered to bring your smart phone we can get a great upskirt shot.
She's sure to tire eventually.
I don't know about you, but I'm not sure I can march to the beat of this drummer for much longer.
I'll follow anyone who puts on a show.
We're so lucky that there's a Macy's out here.
I still say she has a nice rear end.
"I'd like to march to the beat of a different drummer".
I still say she's a guy!
SoulCycle just wasn't doing it for me any more.
I like her spunk.
Great idea, ISIS will never find us.
When we start hallucinating a flag corps, we are truly done for.
Show off
She's just like us.
I think we're marching to the wrong drum majorette.
It's been miles, can't we have a turn with my mirage?
The trick is to have a baton filled with water.
See . . . I told you she wasn't wearing any underwear!
I knew marching band members had stamina, but this is ridiculous!
I hope she makes us spell out something cool in the sand.
She's too old for a mirage.
I don't think we're headed towards 34th Street.
Brexit, Trump, us surviving...this really is the year of the underdog.
Do you think halftime is over yet?
She said we could keep our doctor.
I just hope it's a St. Patty's Parade that we're gonna be in.
Are you sure she's not a mirage?
Well, we did want a change, didn't we?
These Orange Bowl halftimes just keep getting longer and longer!
We´ve crawled a mile for one of her smiles.
Your "Old School Google Maps" app was totally worth it.
We'll get to Pasadena by New Year's.
Where are the trombones?" "Think damn ya, think.
I hope the parade ends soon, I'm gettin' awful thirsty.
The Macy's Annual Thanksgiving Parade after Trump takes presidency.
Are you 100% positive he said, "Simple Simon Says: synchronously crawl behind the majorette" ?
Well alright! I just love a parade!
I could go for another trombonist about now.
Her high step and costume are nice but I really like her sense of direction.
I just don't feel that peppy.
She's always marched to her own drummer.
I promised her she could be in the halftime show.
I thought divining rods were supposed to be Y shaped.
A drum majorette? Nice! I'm following Bernie Sanders.
Mirage- she said her name is!
She says to me, 'You know how to whistle, don't you?'
I'm starting to think he entered the wrong address in his gps for the parade route!
Are you sure the Mummers started like this?
So tell me- is this a folie à deux or a ménage à trois?
I'm so thirsty I hope it rains on my parade
"I know this is arduous, but I do it for the view".
Just keep in step.we are almost there.
Well, they did say the Macy's parade will be shorter.
Next time, we jump on the wagon!
I thought she was saying "Life's a beach"
You at quarterback today or is it me?
Drum majors have a sense of direction.
Let's ditch her at El Paso and duck into Sammy's for a drink.
I've been the 'band' for the last 5 hours. Now it's your turn. And make a smoother transition this time, so she doesn't notice.
I've never been a leg man myself.
No Bob, he really is going to build a wall.
I don't think we're in Hamelin anymore, Otto.
She told me we were playing Follow the Leader.
Don't worry. This will end as soon as the guy with the tuba dots the "i"!
Left, not right
"Follow the tour guide" you said. "This is going to be bigly" you said.
You've been out of step since that last right flank."
You know, there is a certain majesty to the thing.
Think of the stadium....think of the crowd........think of the cheerleaders.......
She marches to a different drummer.
PLEASE, Barbra...rain on our parade!
You're the whistle blower. Blow it NOW.
We'd be sunk if she'd ended up as a cheerleader.
What happened to the tuba player?
I'm assuming they have concession stands at the stadium.
I can't help it -- I went to THE Ohio State.
Given our proximity to the parade, 'dumb' major is more like it.
I told you we should've used Waze.
I was a drum major in high school, but it never took me this far.
Do you think it will rain on your parade?
Do you hear "The Stars and Stripes Forever"?
This is unreal, she's actually humming The Stars And Stripes Forever.
Got Matzoh?
Big deal. Show me the 76 trombones.
Let's try to signal passing aircraft with a baton twirl.
It's been better since she got rid of the cymbals.
Four years in power, and this is what's left.
We should have just let the Pharaoh be drum major.
I thought football fields where only 100 yards !
I don't know how she keeps going.
And you said she wouldn't get past the city limit.
Life was much simpler when we were just two men and a truck....
Have you seen my tuba?
I'm glad we gave her the rest of the water.
At least she's not twirling fire.
She's marching to the beat of a drummer we need to find.
Gary, Indiana must be this way.
Altogether now! Right hand left foot, left hand right foot...
I always wanted to be in a parade!
She said she was from Macy's.
Don't worry, as soon as we pass my wife, the rain will come.
What have we done with our lives?
I hope you are right Al, it doesn't seem like Trump is leading us to the promise-land.
I also think climate change is a hoax.
I kind of like this without the music.
''So who told her that this was a short cut back to Macy's"
If this is the best way to get to the football stadium, maybe global warming is for real after all.
This has been a tough trip, but at least she didn't makes go over the rock.
I love a woman who marches to the beat of her own drummer.
I think we should have followed the hot dog cart.
Are we to Macy's yet?
She's headed somewhere and we were lost, so why not follow her.
I'm not so sure we shoulda taken that alt-right toin at Albuquerque.
And then she said, "I think we should take separate vacations ".
...next stop: 34th and Broadway!
You see? I really, really do love a parade.
"Let's give him a chance," you said.
I think we might be taking this 'protest the national anthem' thing a little too far.
Her positive thinking is admirable, but this is the third time she's led us past this same spot.
I'm beginning to doubt whether there really is a Lost Majorette's Gold Mine.
Well, at least we've made it to halftime.
I don't care what they say, being Grand Marshall is no parade.
But we're not rats and that's not the Pied Piper.
I really don't think this is how the Macy's parade got started.
In my car, it turns out, it stands for Ginger's Parade Strutting.
I liked your mirage of an oasis better than mine!
Best mirage I've ever seen... Much better than a lake...
At least we lost the horses.
I'll quit if you quit.
Does this mean we made it to half-time?
This better not be another one of your ridiculous mirages!
Game should be over by now. Let's ask for a score
I guess at least one of us has to stay positive.
I'm beginning to think she may be a robot.
Just wait for the craft beer float.
Did you hear who he picked for his cabinet?
So much for your assertion that there is ALWAYS rain on your parade.
Actually, she does have a brother named Moses
i know, but it's the only act in town.
Are you sure this is the way to the Rose Bowl?
see what?
Pinch her behind see if she minds.
Forget what she said. She's can't remember the parade route either.
I thought Trump won.
This is really a long parade
Are you sure she knows the way to Pretoria?
When you've got a good band leader, who needs water?
I don't think we're going to be bowl-eligible this year.
Yes I do think she should run for a fourth term.
We find ourselves in an unusual situation.
I'm beginning to wonder if we're following the wrong Field Commander.
And you were worried she would lead us into a dead end!
You sure she's not a miragette?
How does that go...Neither a leader or a follower be?
She's in step but I don't hear the band.
Just hope she doesn't hit The Wall.
Next up is an elegy.
"I told you we should have followed the beat of a different drummer.
I think I can-can...I think I can-can...
Still better than the Macy's parade.
Her march may be our crawl, but the important thing is that we're all getting our tuition paid for.
Are you sure you can trust your own instincts this time around?
Two more miles and we make the Guinness record book for longest parade
Where was this little gem when we were agonizing over the Comb Over and the Pantsuit?
I don't think she can hear us.
Hey, pssst....Off the record...Got any tic-tacs?
I'm beginning to think this was a big mistake.
You told me your dominatrix did home visits.
You know my grandfather died at the real Bataan Death March.
Just imagine the thunderous applause as we enter stage left for journey's end.
I'm really attracted to the fact that she marches to the beat of her own drum.
On the flip side, watching her butt wiggle makes it sorta fun.
Okay, I think we did it. We beat the band. You tell her.
Trust me on this, our loyalty will be rewarded when the rest of the crowd realizes she is on the right track.
march
No, it's MY turn next and then you go.
It's a fine start Meredith, but the audience might also expect trombones... a few coronets...
Now I'm thinkin' she DIDN'T say, "Follow me to the dessert, boys."
Pace yourself. The march isn't until January 21.
I know we told her we'd follow her anywhere, but this is getting ridiculous.
Well, it seemed like a good idea last yesterday.
Garter. I thought you said there was a garden ahead.
She's a very determined young lady.
I knew we should have taken a left at Columbus Circle.
A plan to lead us out of despair, a relentlessly upbeat persona--and killer legs, to boot; now THIS is the woman who can beat Trump in 2020!
The marching band refused to yield...until inevitable death from starvation.
In the event of nuclear holocaust, deploy your emergency bandleader who will guide you to safety.
Can you tell me, why did we do this again?
I never can resist her siren song.
After that last curve I'm beginning to doubt she's on the hunt for water...
It must be a halftime mirage.
I must admit, my mirage hallucinations have improved since increasing my Ginko Biloba.
Please tell him that one of the saxophones is out of tune—this is torture.
We should have taken some music lessons.
Why did you have to tell her that her white cane is a baton?
But which one was the dale?
Iowa, Joe, Iowa!! Don't you see? We're not lost. Just keep following her. She's kicking off the start of the 2020 caucus!
It was your idea to play follow the leader.
She's so upbeat, I'd follow her anywhere.
There are alternate ways to get to Pretoria
Thank God, we forgot our sousaphones.
I see we both go the high stepping, spirited type
Im only following because she promised water
She thinks she hears a different drummer.
Pomp? I thought you said pump.
Women didn't fall in line behind Hillary but some white men did.
It's a march - 4/4 time, I think.......
Always my curse--following the wrong majorette.
I thought the ones marching to a different drummer went the other way.
I just had this nagging thought that she might be a mirage.
I told you she has stamina.
I don't think I like Utah's interactive half-time show.
Yeah, I don't remember the moral of the Pied Piper either.
Are we really going to see Santa at the end of this parade?
Guess the rumors are true. The NFL attendance is down.
I could swear she was wearing a pantsuit when we started!
Yeah, but neither are we 76 trombones.
Well, we've gone this far- may as well finish the march.
She marches to the beat of a different drummer.
Leadership is all that counts.
"What harm would their be in marching to the beat of a different drum major?" you asked.
I should have read the fine print before signing up
This one time, in band camp...
Just hang in there — he's going to make pep band GREAT again.
You always did crawl to the feet of a different march, didn't you?
I love a good parade.
I told you "blind faith" never does any good
So where's the free dessert?
Worth it!
Think she's playing lost compass?
Is her name really Jean Philip Sousa?
I like the view from behind!
Trump L'oeil!
Trump University Alumni or one of his contractors?
Well, he definitely marches to the beat of a different drummer.
When and where did we lose the drummers?
Simon's so bossy today.
It's time we tell Simon he's taken this game too far.
It’s hard to stay in step without t music.
I was promised a Starbucks when we reach the city.
"Everybody loves a parade," but this is going to FAR!!
''It's been 40 years since she parted the sea. Do you think we're still on target for that pot of gold?''
It's important to follow a leader.
We ate the 76 trombones, why stop now?
It's a good thing this isn't snow.
Why couldn't we get a normal drill sergeant?
Just admit you signed us up for the Annual 'Baton' Memorial March by mistake.
I heard she gets paid more than us." "Yeah, I heard she's an illegal immigrant from Syria with a transgender partner" "I wouldn't want the job. Having to smile all the time. I have to be myself." "At the end of the day, we're all fucked" "True
NOW she wants to go to Iowa!
I'm excited about our new direction. But I'll admit I'm still a bit leery of it.
Didn't you think it was a dessert parade?
Talk about celebrating global warming denial!
As long as we get some Black Friday deals - it was worth it
T hat''s what we get for being out of step.
An original mirage! I love it!
Mine was a protest vote. You?
"Great Idea", 2 tickets to the Cactus Bowl?
Marching to the beat of indifference to bums
We'll make Macy's parade on time, you watch.
Have you ever really taken a good look at yourself? I mean a REALLY good look.
I'd try Uber, but my cell isn't showing any bars.
Does this make us 'sheeple'?
Is this our path to greatness? Following this flamboyant person?
Would people mistake us for camels from Google Earth?
Stick with it and someday you'll be as good a follower as I am.
And of course, if that gets leaked, we'll say this conversation was locker-room talk
Convivial tone this mirage, don't you think?
OK, you were right, not too many Irish live in Death Valley....
Of course that would have been easier, but I left my dowser in the car.
She said she knew the way to Macy's and who are we to doubt her?
No one really wins a battle of the marching bands.
We never should have voted for Jill Stein!
This is my fuckin' fantasy, so what are you still doin' here?
This is one long game of "Follow the Leader"
I bet we'd do better if we had batons, too!
Wait, are we still protesting that guy?! Where is everyone?!
I think we're finally on the right trail.
I have to admit, this guy could shoot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue and I'd still follow him.
At least you have an excuse, I'm a trumpet player!
That's where you are supposed to come in with the euphoniums, Charlie
I like where this new leader is taking us.
To be honest with you Ken, after following your hinder for the last three days I really don't care if it is a mirage or not.
You sure his name is Moses?
I know you're thirsty, but don't rain on my parade.
Nothing is going to rain on *this* parade.
I haven't the heart to tell her that I still don't hear any trombones.
He said he is taking us to a new life. That has to be a good thing, right?
What's in her energy drink?
I don't see any point in letting her know we're leading from behind.
This Real Desert sightseeing tour seems a little bit orchestrated.
I think our supreme leader slightly misinterpreted what it means to keep calm and carry a big stick.
I'd say there's more chance of Trump being president than this being a mirage.
When were things supposed to start getting better?
He's leading us to a great place, 'a tremendous place, you won't believe', he said.
she knows where water is
I think that she is leading us from one ex-stream to another.
Actually, I still prefer deuces wild to follow the queen.
Nothing ever happens around here.
I guess the band music was a mirage after all.
Wait til' you see the encore
Excuse me if I'm not feeling super patriotic right now.
Forget the desert bowl, next year it's Pasadena or bust
Is it just me, or did we take a wrong turn off the football field?
I dropped my kazoo. You'll have to take over the next time she says, "Strike up the band."
It's a major desert
Get ready...in six measures we spell out Chrysanthemum.
You and your, "Let's be in a parade, it'll be fun" crap!
Seriously! Why did we have to park with the band?
She clearly marches to her own drum beat.
Do have change for a 20?
You know, ... I only like a parade.
I hope you are happy with your vote! We're being led into the unknown.
One, we're crawling...not marching. Two, we don't have instruments.
Well it's a better view!
'... from sea ... to ... shining....' O, Christ, is it 2020 yet?
He said there is refreshments at halftime.
You know, we'd never have got this service if we'd gone to a small, trendy liberal arts college.
Stop singing 'Don't Rain on My Parade'!
She seemed really confident about heading this way.
Still think she knows where the waterhole is?
Thoreau said we should march to the beat of a different DRUMMER.
No doubt we've both fallen for her.
Times like this, I wish I learnt how to play the tuba.
By now, we're old enough to find our way back to Hamelin.
I don't care what she wants to do as long as she leads us to water.
Wandering for four years in the wilderness is better than forty.
I'm dying of thirst and now you're telling me he's really a mirage?
This is every bit as good as her tweets!
There must be good times with celebrations somewhere.
Mirage or not, I just feel inspired to keep following!
At least the view from down here is pretty good!
"Times like this I wish I had Donald Trumps energy".
We knew better than to join that parade of climate change deniers. Why didn't we fight back when we had the chance??
I hope her GPS system is working.
No, I don't know how its going to be great again.
Did you know that George Bush was once a twirler too?
Keep a-movin', Dan.
With white working class men behind her, I figure the sky's the limit.
This can't be what it's all about Alfie.
Stop bitching, Stan. We must be almost at the stadium by now.
We should have turned at the trombone player.
At least, we don't have to carry those humongous bass drums anymore.
I can't even recall what instruments were supposed to be playing!
I can still hear the band playing our swan song.
So much for "Give it a twirl"!
Does she know where we're going, or is she leading us astray?
I love it when she tortures us with all this zigging and zagging.
What parade is this again?
What if she's a robot?
Just because there aren't seventy-six trombones doesn't mean it's a mirage
I thought sooner or later we'd find a big cooler of Gatorade ...
Is this your mirage or mine? and will she lead us to water?
She's one hell of a Sand Leader
Should we tell her Thanksgiving is over?
Off to the right is were they filmed Star Wars Episode IV.
I'm not even a baton man
This Hipster Tour of the Mojave Desert wasn't quite what I had in mind.
A plan to lead us out of despair, a relentlessly upbeat persona--and killer legs, to boot; now THIS is your first female President of the United States!
It must've rained on her parade...
I thought this parade ended at the wall?
Someone should tell her that, as a rule of thumb, shorter, more frequent breaks work better than infrequent, longer breaks.
I didnt support Trump after the audio tape. You?
Only seventy-five trombones to go.
At this point, we're more of a marching sand.
I'm starting to think there really is a drought, so much for marching blindly to the beat of the Trump,.....I wonder what else isn't true?
At least it ain't rainin' on our parade.
I warned you not to get her a step tracker.
Mirage,shmirage, who cares?
Trying to find your car after the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
Her cup is half full.
I'm betting it rains on this parade.
He thinks we're going to Burning Man.
Frankly, I was hoping for an ice-cream float.
Have faith. She's cheer leader, rain dancer, water diviner all rolled into one!
Woo hoo, we left the marchers in the dust!
Ok, who told you she could do a rain dance?
If we stay close to her we won't get run over by the band.
At least there's a cloud in the sky...
Remember? Yesterday she had on riding boots!
I don't know about you, Randy--but nothing gets me up and moving like the Washington Post March!!!
This is what we get for not paying the last pipe piper.
She promise you drumsticks too?
So what are we supposed to be celebrating?
You think all of this is really worth it for free David Copperfield tickets?
So When do we get to dot the "I"?
They're calling it a Post-Truth Parade.
Frankly, I'd enjoy this mirage more if it came with actual marching band music.
With those tiny hands, I keep expecting him to drop the baton. But no.
No matter what, I'm still with her!
Survival of the flounciest
Do you think the parade will be over in time for the Homecoming Dance?
Submit what they will, those captions should all boil down to, "I hate her."
She promised Gatorade once halftime ends.
I know, I know, but his marching band was huge and bigly successful.
I have to tell you, I'll be very disappointed if there is no marching band at the end of this.
Look, it's a guy!
These off-the-strip Vegas shows aren't half bad.
It's just that you keep parading around like you're always thirsty or something.
You're still not in sync! Do as I say, not as I do. It's 1,2,3,4, 1,2,3,4. Not 1,2, 1,2.
When will she pass the baton?
She's Georgia O'Keefe's daughter.
A considered turn to the right? No, I'm just following out of idle curiosity
That is the last time I book the scenic tour.
I just remembered Martha wanted me to bring a ham home this evening.
I think we were better off following that blind tortoise with IBS.
You know, of course, we'll have to drink her bodily fluids to survive..
I love a parade, the tramping of feet, I love every beat, I hear of a drum! I love a parade, when I hear a band, I just want to stand, and cheer as they come...
I guess we shouldn't have mocked the marching band.
I feel good about this.
It's another case of the right temperament, but not enough followers in rural areas.
You wanted change ?
You won't believe this, but I've got this ear worm that I can't get outta my head and it's driving me crazy..."76 trombones led the BIG parade..."
Hail to the Victors? Are you kidding me?
And to think they said middle management was dead.
Your parade, your parade, I'm sick and tired of hearing about your parade.
She really marches to the beat of her own drummer.
The polls say we're following the other guy.
Mirage either way there's bar in our future.
What's her secret?
Do you believe in mirages?
No sign of seventy-six trombones around here.
Hope she knows where we're going.
the bet's off if she trips.
No, I told the genie I wanted to enjoy a warm dessert with my buddy after you made a dumb wager.
Don't worry--her step's lively. We'll get there hands down!
I know this didn't work before, but trust me she will make us great again!
I thought he said we were going to River City.
Sometimes I wonder if my motivation to keep going is internal, or... ?
Drum major? He's more like a drill sergeant.
You should see her from my side.
Well, we sang the song, "I love a parade," now what?
It's got a good beat, and you can dance to it.
Her name is Moses. I imagined her for us.
Do you still think we should have believed her when she said she knew more about the desert than the camels?
I've never met anyone with such command presence.
this is way different then band camp
There was a lake a mile or so back, but I'm really feeling this guy's charisma.
She may lead us to the water but we don't have to drink!
And I would crawl 500 miles
I'm so proud to be an american.
I didn't see it coming but it's so obvious now!
Anyway we should reset ourselves to follow the new leader.
I can see my wife from here.
This means our crawl is half over.
Is this desert or dessert -- I never can remember?
Yes, she is a strong leader.
Do you think they'd still "long to be in that number" if the knew?
Remember three years ago?! It started to rain at about this time.
I'm the starting quarterback.
Yeah, you're right-pointless, but the view IS awesome!
I told you we were flying over Burning Man.
She knows the way to San Jose.
The election's over but you're still out of step.
Don't let the parade pass you by.
I thought you said" travel to the beat of a different drum major!"
Band or no band, she looks like she knows where we should go.
He doesn't identify as thirsty.
I never thought an oasis looked so good!
Still easier than following the Presidential candidacy race...albeit not as entertaining.
It's a Long Way to Tripperary!
But you said The Music Man was a great play and we should follow its lead!
Next year I hear we're behind the inflatable ship.
I hear there's water at the end of the Macy's parade.
' come on, keep up. she's saying right left right left.'
This is the last time I try peeking under someone's skirt.
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name it feels good to be out of the rain.
She says she's from the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. All things considered I have my doubts.
Well we found the circus, the bread must not be far behind.
Jeez, we fell for the same damn thing in "Animal House.
I've always been a high boots guy.
Hey Rudy! What's up Chris?!
And you say Macy's isn't trying anymore!
This is what I call happy trails!
Drum majors always know the nearest bar.
She marches to the beat of a different drummer.
What if she's just leading us to a Patriots' game?
Yes, my thighs feel thinner. But not by forty-seven percent.
I told you we should of got better seats for the game
I hate this time of year.
Have I ever mentioned my PhD thesis on sunk costs?
All this just to break in a pair of new boots?
We won!
Are we "The Band on the Run?"
Great gams but slow on the down beat.
No, I didn't say "Gala Positioning System"!
and the beat goes on an on an on .........
We should have taken a left at Albuquerque!
You're lucky. My wife would never do this.
until today you and I have always moved to the beat of a different drum
I'm so hungry I could eat a pom-pom.
When do you think he'll realize he's naked?
Yeah - hot weather, and women in skirts. Its still not exactly my idea of a March vacation.
Just keep following. It's her turn.
"I've always crawled to the beat of my own drummer".
She's practising for Trumps inauguration parade. Do you got any tic tacs?
I think it was a good idea to band together.
Broadway was a 1,000 miles back but she's still as spry as ever.
I wish they'd gives a caption already, so we could stop crawling.
If we have to whistle "76 Trombones" one moe time, I'll throw in the towel.
For the hundredth time, we're marching. There is no beat. She's no drummer.
Lets hope we don't come to a cliff
I don't think she is leading us towards Herald Square
She had you at the first baton twirl.
I always thought the shortest distance between two points was a straight line.
Can you hear the trumpets? We must be getting close.
We're three quarters there.
'He's making us great again, I think.'
I can't carry a note.
Either it's a mirage or we're really onto something big!
Girls with directions...
Don't even think about marrying her.
Well, someone needs to tell her that she's not in command of her band.
At this point, I'd day the heck with the Rose Bowl!
Maybe we should reconsider our liberal leaders.
"Hey, wait a minute, did she say Bataan?'
She's like the energizer bunny, she keeps going and going!
I guess Hillary lost her bandwagon
Be thankful for what you have
The town's three residents have a parade whenever tourists come.
He does this every year.
With those high struts I was sure she knew the way.
We follow our team all the way
I thought you said she's leading us to water !
You swear she's out here divining for water?

I feel more like the dumb corps...
Thanks dude, this Trump majorette beats a camel any day of the week.

If you can't help carrying on about her height, at least use a different metaphor.
I can almost see the end.
I get the feeling they're making fun of us.
What do you think of the band program?
Let's change to a gymnast
Did you find your keys yet?
Well look on the bright side. If she doesn't lead us to water at least we got our aerobic exercise in for this week. OR "I'm a real sucker for a woman with leadership qualities."
She's marching to the beat of her own drum we should have turned around long ago.

Hope she knows more than the command to crawl.
It's been a lot easier since I traded in my sousaphone for a bottle of Trump water.
I'm not sure about this, Larry. Actually, I think it said "WORSHIP can lead us out of the desert.".
Does he know we are not following his beat?
Funny...Dazzling displays of nature usually distract me from our plight.
They should change it to "and lead us into pomp and ceremony".
My arse she's real. It's just another one of your idiotic mirages.
Should we really follow the leader wherever she may go?
I knew we should have just gone for the ice cream sandwich.
Maybe she thinks we told her that we wanted to play in the sand.

We're certainly NOT hearing the beat of the same drummer.
She's always marched to her own drummer.
This is my first moving mirage!
Two quick observations. One- halftime should have been over 12 hours ago. Two- I think she's plain nuts.
Time to turn back? Maybe there's one with GPS.
Should we tell her it's a desert?
It's not that I'm exhausted, it's girl-power.
Don’t blame me. It was you who said signing up for the Band of Brothers was a cool idea.
Dunno where we're going, but at least we're keeping in step...
