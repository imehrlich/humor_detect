And to my favorite nephew Harold, I bequeath the seven chairs that sit before you.
These previous seats, State, Defense, Commerce, Homeland Security, and so on- are now all filled with great people, tremendous people. They say you're a terrific ornithologist. I just need a little guidance with my tweets.
Snow White left her estate to the Seven Dwarfs and the Guy Who Did Her Taxes.
But around here, there'll be no whistling while you work!
They don't call me The Chairman for nothin'.
OK, start the music.
After watching seven of the managers above him getting fired one at a time, Bob wondered if there would be bagels after the meeting.
I'm sorry Mam, but you'll just have to wait your turn-as you can see there are a lot of qualified men ahead of you.
You may be wondering why I've asked you all here today.
The position has been filled.
I didn't say "Simon says".
Your issue will be addressed in the order it was received.
"In addition, the position offers significant opportunities for advancement.?
Well, as an economy class employee, you'll have to pay to check your briefcase.
Congratulations. I'm promoting you to 7th vice-president.
I'm sorry. You picked the wrong chair again, Mr. Smith. Better luck tomorrow!
Hello, Jim. Welcome to the United States Postal Service headquarters.
Gottlieb, I've asked you here today for a status report on my new conference table.
Please remain seated until the interview comes to a complete stop. Permanecer sentados, por favor.
Last and Least.....
So...which one has the pea?
As you can see, we take the role of chairman quite seriously.
You’re last and most likely the least.
We'll be joined by the Vertical Integration team.
You weren't my first choice, but you're next in line.
It is time to re-evaluate your position in this company.
Coffee? Tea? Binoculars?
For efficiency I've eliminated the chain of command.
When the music stops, you're fired.
No worries, it actually helps to be the last person interviewed.
I’m looking for a farsighted businessman.
Mercer, it's the end of the line for you.
I feel like you're trying to tell me something.
Because I can.
Who are you calling a coxswain?
Be assured the seating is random and in no way reflects your status.
And, as a new employee, you have your career path in front of you.
Welcome to the chain of command, Johnson.
I thought offering everyone an aisle seat would draw more people to this meeting.
Not that one!
Now that I have ranked the candidates by preference, let us proceed.
For only $320 we can upgrade you to "business class".
As I predicted, very few people survived the reorganization.
So what qualifications do you have as a caboose operator?
Something tells me I'm either way too early or way too late,...
'The will specifically states that everything goes to the seventh son.'
I'm looking for a non-linear thinker.
I guess that leaves you Tillerson.
What this means is that you were my last choice!
Management practices learned at the Department of Motor Vehicles are hard to break.
You are now free to move about the cabin.
There's no chain of command here, just streamlined vertical integration.
...keeping in mind that the closest exit may be behind you
Can everyone hear me in the back?
Should have booked the priority seat for the interview
I regret to inform you Matthew that the last actually will be last.
I don't care if you are the last man on Earth. "You're fired!"
So this is why they call him the Chairman.
You may have the aisle but I get the window!
The front rows are reserved for members of our platinum program.
Thanks for coming to this press conference. In the interest of time, only the first seven rows of reporters can ask questions.
20/20 vision is essential for this job!
So, you think you'd like to work for us here at Boeing?
So, as the designated survivor...
What kind of columnist did you think we were looking for?
There's seating available in the front.
They are reserved for important people.
Think of it as the front of a line in which you’re sitting backwards.
Welcome to the Clinton Foundation, Mr. Five Dollar Donor.
I like a woman who knows her place.
I take it your the very last person to kiss my ass today?
I'm sorry, but that's the company line.
Comfy?
Well Snow White. Your dwarfs are late for the meeting. Again.
Like many top executives, I prefer to maintain at least six degrees of separation from any controversy.
There are a lot of nobodies ahead of you, son.
Did you want to trade in some of your miles and be upgraded to first class?
Please be patient. We have more than the usual number of chairs today.
I can see something in you that the others are missing.
My Feng Shui guy swears this helps the energy, and it must because he's always laughing when he leaves.
Candidly, you weren't our first choice for this position, or even our seventh.
There is room for you to work your way up in this company.
I did ask for the exit row
NO ! I said "eight cheers" for our new partner.
Uncle Harry always made sure his nephew remembered he was only eighth in line to his fortune
Interesting choice. You're hired!
You're next.
I suppose you're wondering why I asked you and your six little friends to stop in.
I apologize for the misprint. This is the interview for chair traffic controller.
Will you be filling any vacancies today?
I started from the back and now I'm here
Please wait until your number is called.
My strengths, let's see, I've been told I'm good at leading from behind.
Work hard, and you'll move up quickly
I always fly economy.
Last chance to buy an upgrade.
The dwarves will be here shortly.
I'm afraid your request for an upgrade did not go through.
I have you in line for something.
Good choice. We like employees who have vision.
You'd be eighth Vice President, but our first visible one.
It's a bit of a commute.
Our employees do not climb; they move forward
I don't mind waiting.
Today, it appears, that the last shall be first.
You're next.
It feels just right, sir!
You aren't obligated to sit in the last seat, Mr. Zwick.
My daughter has the furnishings concession, is why.
I'll wait. Eight is my lucky number.
Welcome to business class.
You're on the upgrade list.
...and that brings us to you, Mother.
Good morning, 8A
Thank you for seeing me, Mr. Trump.
I am afraid you will have to wait your turn.
I said shares!
Bob regretted not having upgraded to First Class.
You know, this company could use a man who takes a back seat to no one.
So convince me you need to move to the next chair....
At our company, there are plenty of opportunities to get ahead.
You are going to have to speak up.
From front to back, I'd like you to welcome Topper, Mrs. Muir, Casper, Sam Wheat, Jacob Marley, Dr. Malcolm Crowe and Hamlet's father.
I have a thing about getting too close to my employees
This is why you must never, ever reply-all.
Yes, I see that. But you still have to wait your turn!!
Why must you always take a back seat to no one?
Alright, who's next?
This is not what I meant when I asked you to chair the meeting.
My management style? I tend to lead from behind.
For every right answer to my questions you will advance forward one chair.
I see on your resume that you have experience with office layout...
Well, Smith, let’s talk about Accounting’s rule that we all must fly Coach.
There, I created space for dissenting opinions!
Hmm. That is the correct spelling of 'succedaneum'. You may advance one chair.
This puts climbing our corporate ladder in a more comfortable perspective.
Not very bright, are you?
Why, yes, I used to work for Jet Blue. How did you know?
Eighth chair? It's like playing triangle in the high school band.
WHO IS NEXT?
Why is it that lawyers always choose the emergency exit row?
You are correct, Ms. Foster, the capital of Kazakhstan is indeed Astana. Please move forward three spaces.
Don't underestimate the competition
Just waiting for The Seven Deadly Sins to get here.
We'll be boarding today's meeting starting from the rear of the cabin.
My strength is that I am a back seat driver.
Which of you would like to Chair our next fundraising event?
Do you have any experience working in the airline industry?
That's the closest anyone has made it in the interview process so far.
I understand you're the corporate analyst who claimed I'm a narrow-minded SOB.
So, why do you want to work for NASA, Mr. .... Neptune?
Due to budget cuts, we're prepping you to travel coach.
Congratulations! You're hired. The others left when the music stopped.
Interesting use of the space, Mr. Chairman.
I come from a long line of Chairmen.
No, that is NOT why they call me 'Chairman'.
SO, let me understand: Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy and Dopey are walking out to renegotiate and you're their lawyer, Mr. Sleazy?
You didn't say 'Donald may I?'
I'm pretty sure the rules are when the music stops, we remove a chair.
I'm known throughout the industry for putting people first.
Yes , I would consider it a message.
Young man in the back. Did you not read my ad? It clearly states I'm only hiring ghost writers.
You just seem so distant lately!
As you can see, we offer many opportunities for a new employee to move up in the company.
My philosophy is simple. The first shall be last and the last will stay last.
Right then, going down the list, is number 2 here?
All in favor?
As you can see, Mr. Berry, there are many talented applicants ahead of you.
In this part of the interview, we will test how you handle a long distance relationship.
I think you'll find that our benefits are excellent and that there is plenty of opportunity for advancement.
Now, tell me how I sound from third in the front.
I hope you're better than our last Feng Shui Master.
I have reason to believe that one of you may not be a toddler.
If you can hear me, you're fired.
Simon says you can move one chair forward.
If we make a profit this year we'll buy a table.
So, perhaps YOU would like to be Secretary of State?!
I like a man who knows how to take a backseat to his boss.
Your previous job was interior cabin design at Boeing?
And you sir, at the back. Are you representing Messrs. Happy, Sleepy, Dopey et al. in this deposition?
Because you stink...that's why.
The job requires unique solutions to linear problems.
Thank you for waiting, Mr. Blitzen.
I hear you're the guy behind the guy, behind the guy, behind the guy...
In conclusion...
Welcome aboard, Johnson.
The caboose is very important - but yes, I am always the engine.
The reserved seats are courtesy of our corporate sponsors. Next question?
Let's see, chair 8...assistant to the assistant deputy second vice president, right?
Seats number one through seven: thank you for your time. Seat number eight: come back tomorrow.
No, I meant literally. Please take a seat.
Want to be Secretary of State?
I'll be with you in a minute, mom.
Before we begin the interview process, let me explain why all of you are here.
So you want to be in the railroad business.
I asked you to stay after the others left so I can finally see who you are.
Not that one!
Welcome to the emergency meeting of the office design subcommittee.
The cleaners like feng shui; they just don't like me.
Can you hear me back there? I asked if you consider yourself to be an assertive person.
Since you ask, the other seven auditors are currently in witness protection.
Don't worry, the other candidates are all very short.
So, Mr. Consultant, just how would you reorganize things here at Caboose, International?
Let's make this quick. I've got a long line of people after this.
Donald, you are far and away the best candidate for the job.
Fortunately for you the curse only extended to the seventh son.
As for you...
At our airline everybody gets an aisle seat.
Raise your hand if you can hear me in the back.
The one all the way in the back. You seem eager. What's your question?
Would like to upgrade to business class?
The beverage cart will be coming down the aisle shortly.
Number eight. Please step forward.
Finally, an aisle seat!
Welcome to the annual Shareholder meeting.
We've got a few open chairs you can fill.
Sir, with all due respect, you told me to get the board members in line.
By a process of elimination, it is now your turn to be eliminated.
I see you back there, Hollingsworth. No point trying to be inconspicuous.
Unfortunately, we have decided we won't be filling the vacancies at this time.
Simon says, take out your resumé and move one chair closer.
I'm a cinch for this job. Just a bunch of nobodies ahead of me.
Number nine? Number nine?
I'm sorry. You'll have to place your carry-on under the seat in front of you.
You're just the man for the job, assuming we don't find anyone else first.
I can’t fire you until I see the whites of your eyes
Your application is very important to us. Your interview will be conducted in the order it was received.
Are there opportunities to move up in this office?
Yes, Mr. President, I would say this qualifies as arms length.
You'll be pleased to know that you're my eighth choice for the job
Room for advancement? Let me check.
See how close you can get before the music stops.

Henry....the eighth.
I'm sorry, Ken, but you're in the exit row.
Simon says, "Take two chairs forward."
Oh I don't mind waiting, I've been assured my inquiry is very important to you multiple times already.
We like to think of ourselves as a far-sighted company.
I'm counting on you to step up.
Is it my breath?
Tell me, why you want a job with Amtrak?
If the company crashes, that's the best seat.
Allen never could take a hint.
I would ask you to sit closer but unfortunately the other chairs are reserved for the more qualified job applicants.
You can't fire me too, dad. I'm your son, Barron.
It’s for your own protection — I had tuna and onion dip for lunch.
I'm not the chairman of the board, I'm chairman of the chairs.
Alphabetically, Mr Zorata.
Could you speak up please?
When I asked you to anchor the meeting.....
Nope - those chairs are for people who don't hate my guts.
HR wants me to maintain some management distance.
It should be clear to you that I'm the engine of this company and you, you're the caboose.
How many chairs closer do you see yourself in five years?
There'll be room for advancement.
A golden parachute is located in a pouch under your seat or under the armrest.
You have a remote chance of being hired.
If you can hear me in the back row, get out.

I'll hear your report, 008.
You really should have booked your appointment earlier.
Mr. President, with all due respect, I'm afraid I won't give you the nuclear code either.
I see you chose the comfy chair.
I start every interview with this question: which seat in the roller coaster moves faster, the front, or the back?
This is what you meant by line management.
What makes you believe you'd be a good caboose operator?
You are supposed to wait for the music to stop before grabbing a seat.
I'm meeting with Middle Management separately...
Two! Four! Six! Eight! Who's the temp we terminate?
I'm ready for my eye test.
Your bag must be stowed under the seat in front of you for layoff.
I have never felt comfortable with the six degrees of separation theory.
You must interviewing for the back office position?
That's all we have time for today. Interviews resume on Monday at 10:00 a.m.
He got the job because there was nothing but lazy-boys ahead of him.....
The job of chairman is actually pretty straightforward.
A long time ago, in a chair far, far away.
I said "bring me the chairman", not "bring me the chairs man."
In eight years you’ll be sitting in my seat.
I see that you have been seated commensurately with your salary.
Will the next person in the line of succession please come forward.
Ok Johnson, I'll lead and you follow. Apparently everyone else got out of the way.
Welcome to Delta son.
Why do you want to work for the DMV?

I sense a distance between us
I guess you're next, Mother.
Semi-circles are so last century.
Yes, I'm speaking to you in the back row.
Hey you, in the cheap seat
Bob I assure you in this job you'll take a backseat to no one.
Seems like the other applicants are lacking presence.
No, I'm sure the restraining order said 8 FEET.
You've got something special, Jones! Our next meeting, sit yourself down in Chair #7!
You're probably wondering why I called this meeting.
Ah, yes, the germophobe.
People who had the job before you. They're...away
Well, yes, we did say that applicants should take a back seat to no one.
Yet, I can still smell your aftershave Crumby.
What I really hate are empty suits.
Will this be your first position with a railroad company?
This is a flat organization where you'll advance forward, not upward

As president of B&O Railroad, I like to say 'Welcome Aboard' to new employees.

This is only the first day of Hanukkah. On the eighth day all seats will be taken.

I wanted to be perfectly straight with you today.
OK, OK! Simon says move up to the front chair!
You're probably wondering why I called this meeting.
If you'd like, sir, we could move your 12 o'clock to a closer 12 o'clock.
I'll take one question.
First, we test for your WTF quotient.

I'm sorry, sir, but you'll have to wait your turn.
When you are as controversial as I am, you don't let anyone get close enough to deck you.
...and finally, #8 - You are fired!
You're hired. I did not say 'Simon says everybody get out'.
Did you say something?
You'd never know it, but I started as a train conductor.
That's right. The Cartoonist has run out of ideas.
In this firm you start at the back and have to work your way forward.
Is this an urgent matter?
Did I mention that I used to drive a bus?
This one is definitely the comfiest.
Would anyone like to volunteer?
I see on your application you have a problem with intimacy.
You'll need to speak up.
To repeat the rules of the interview: Correct answer, and you move up a chair. Bad answer, and you go back. As you can see, I must have gotten them all right at some point.

OK. One last time. All in favor?
Because, frankly, you're not ready for first chair.
Congratulations in making it this far. You have been chosen in order of preference.
You may come back tomorrow and move up one chair.

Bob scans the other applicants and feels overqualified
With a little extra hard work, Johnson, I see you sitting in that sixth seat--maybe even the fifth.
Apply Now! We have plenty of open spaces.
I see somebody had the boundaries talk with HR.
Your willingness to take a back seat indicates a subservient attitude. You're hired.
There were a number of candidates in line for your position.
I see you haven't forgotten your place in the chain of command.
You, sir, are "last", not "next".
That's perfect. Don't move. I have three bars on my cell phone.
I'll give you thirty seconds to find the recliner.
Do you think this is church?
The department chairs will precede you.
If you feel intimidated now, wait until you get to the front.
You're the only one left, so you're hired.
Now...you were saying something about a raise?
Bob, we've been downsizing, so there is room for advancement.
Son, they've never called me a nepotist.
How much more transparent can the board of directors be, Mr. Jones?

But you said to sit anywhere I like.
Welcome aboard, I think you'll do well here at Lionel.

I'm sorry, that seat has already been taken, also.
Thank you for coming Mr. Caboose
May I infer that you want to sign up for our assertiveness training program?
What time is your appointment?
You know how important it is to me that we have all of our ducks in a row.
If you want to move up in this firm, might I suggest you reconsider your choice of seat, for starters.
That doesn't really work in this room, I'm still going to call on you

I come from a long line of distinguished chairman.

That´s why they call me the chair man.
You've been promoted. You may move up one.
Please be patient; I'm still waiting for our first class employees...
I feel there's a distance between us, Johnson.
Tom, I met with the others this morning. We've decided to move you up to seat 7. Congratulations!
How are you with "hands off" management?

Is there no possible way to discourage you?
Sorry for the delay....lets go on with the reading of the will. As the the last surviving member from the cast of Eight Is Enough.......
Good job, Wilson. At this rate you'll be promoted to second chair in 93 years.

We'll start the meeting when the other dominoes arrive.
I know you've worked hard for a promotion, Ms. Bensen, but there are many qualified applicants ahead of you.
