36,3,1,Sr. Sanchez felt guilty as he climbed over Trump's wall for leaving that poor Mr. Smith behind in the USA. Poor bastard!
35,3,0,The challenge is knowing where to grab next on this glass rock wall.
36,7,0,"You look worried. Am I not ""visualizing the cliff"" correctly?"
42,7,4,It's called Wile E. Coyote climbing.
48,18,13,Just tell them to finish the damn drawing before I fall off the page.
39,9,3,"I'm not quite sure this is a good time to break the news, my good man, but that appears to be a backpack not a parachute."
49,15,9,You should see my air-guitar routine!

38,12,1,Imagining the climb is the first step to a successful climb.
33,3,0,I guess I'm Air Wall.
42,8,5,Just how high is Trump's wall?
35,6,0,Wait until the wall is built. Mr. Trump says so.
43,11,7,I simply outgrew 'air guitar'.
36,8,1,Am I the first to attempt this climb?
38,8,1,Reaching for the stars again are you?
42,12,5,I guess it really was a mole hill.

37,6,2,I'm terrified of everything--except heights.
44,10,6,It's about here that my fear of heights kicks in.
46,10,6,I think I found Nowhere.
43,14,6,It's this new thing called the Trump Method; you just pull your next point 'outta thin air and climb as high as it'll take you.
37,4,2,"Catch me! My parachute didn't open, and I've pooped my pants!"

39,7,2,Sir Edmund Hillary started this way too.
48,17,11,Just inspecting the Emperor's new wall.
40,7,2,I was *sure* he'd have drawn in some hand-holds by now.
39,14,1,How can you prove that you reached the top?
36,5,1,I'll drop back in after the election.
39,10,2,AFTER THE VIRTUAL CLIMB COMES THE VITUAL FALL
38,8,2,Point made; we will add an elevator stop to the mezzanine.
40,10,3,I get it -- you think you're too good for a metaphor!
36,4,2,Hang on...I'm about to capture Pikachu!
37,10,0,Mime rock climbing is so passé.
42,10,3,Be careful! You are grasping at thin air!
38,5,2,It takes a woman to find the glass ceiling but a man to find the shortcut.
33,3,0,"Hi, I'm Peter and I'm just barely holding it together."
44,21,7,Because it isn't there. Duh.
40,11,4,I learned from watching cartoons that as long as you don't look down you won't fall.
41,11,4,Who paid for this wall?
39,4,2,This is not Wall Street? Now you tell me!
36,3,1,Concentrate!
41,12,3,"After I ditched the ropes and carabiners, this was the next logical step."

36,4,1,The Wall made it harder to get out.
37,6,2,"I'm training for the Winter Olympics on Mars. No mosquitoes, less gravity."
54,34,19,Mime every mountain.
35,4,1,"Darn, Harry dropped his cloak again."

54,33,17,It turns out that mountain climbing is 100% mental
39,12,3,"Yes, I used to be a mime. How did you know?"
36,5,1,Somewhere over the rainbow
46,18,9,Getting down is the hard part.
35,2,1,lol u suck bye
48,30,7,It's the coming down that's really tricky.
47,16,10,I'm taking a virtual climbing class.
36,8,1,This is just practice for the actual rock face.
41,13,3,"This is as far as I got, then they took it away."

38,4,2,Gravity is analog!
40,21,4,i'm half way where?
45,25,6,"Well, that glacier retreated rather quickly!"
34,1,0,NASA called - I'm in training.
43,20,4,You just visualize the wall.
36,4,2,Be careful it's mime.
38,4,2,I getting out of here the fastest way I can before the election.
36,5,1,I'm climbing the ladder to success.
39,10,1,Sheer madness!
38,8,1,You forgot your wall.
40,8,3,"Screw it, I can't wait for no mountain!"
38,3,2,Something there is that would damn well love a wall.
37,6,1,"Catch me, Jim!"
33,7,0,"Don't tell me who our next POTUS is, Both candidates have me climbing the walls !"

35,6,0,I'm just practicing on Donald Trump's wall.
35,7,0,Help. I'm approaching terminal velocity.
37,11,1,Weird. I guess it's mime climb time.
38,5,2,How many rock climbers does it take to change a light bulb?
39,13,1,"What, you've never heard of mime?"
34,5,0,Hey Mister! The mountain's back thattaway!
42,25,2,I was a climate change denier when I started up this glacier.
41,21,4,I took classes online.
40,2,3,Purple crayon? Purple craaay-ooonnnn???
37,5,1,I think we should just try to find an elevator.
38,5,2,"Even if it's two-dimensional, it's still there."
36,13,0,I figure it's better to take an imaginary fall.
35,2,1,"Not to worry ! On this trail, I'll reach the Peak in record time !"

38,4,2,It's called 'Visualization' - Cartoonist David will draw in the wall later.
37,10,1,Got rope?
37,8,1,I've taken this sport up in my retirement. I used to work as a mime.
41,10,3,Corporate ladders are for sissies.
35,5,0,I thought you said you gave me a golden parachute?

36,7,2,I don't think it matters which way I look!
34,6,0,We're just in totally different places in our lives right now.
33,2,0,Enough of The Donald. I'm outta here !
34,2,0,Heard you enjoy making your new employees 'climb the walls' so I hope my technique lives up to your expectations.

44,26,6,Um...You are going to need to show me the ropes.
39,7,3,"It's called ""Free Climbing"""
35,7,1,"I'm so happy, I'm walking on air!"
43,9,4,I told you I was going to be climbing the walls until November 9th
37,13,1,Wake up. You're sleep-climbing again.
42,12,4,You're even more annoying than a regular mime.
37,3,1,"Up,up,and away."
44,10,5,I never thought the rapture would be this tough.
41,5,4,"This mountain is YUGE, trust me."

40,5,2,This would be a lot harder without imaginary bottled oxygen!
35,5,0,Can't help it. I'm just climbing the walls here.
41,10,3,I got hooked on Road Runner cartoons.
39,6,2,Could you fetch a doctor? My glacier calved.
37,11,1,The tricky thing about this particular mountain is that I won't ever know if I actually reached the the summit.
39,10,2,I'll be fine as long as the wind doesn't shift.
38,10,1,"Don't worry, I'm the free hallucination you got by having that peyote popsicle back at the cannabis club"

41,8,4,How could you send the CGI guys to lunch now?
42,19,5,There used to be a corporate ladder here...I think it's been outsourced.
41,8,4,This job has got me climbing the walls.
36,2,1,Yep! I'm 100% sure that I'm scaling the world's largest invisible penis!
36,8,0,"My wife said get out, I said where? She said anywhere but here."
34,6,0,They say the view up there is outa sight.
34,3,0,"Yep, even at that height I think I could Instagram your ass and still get, like, at least, 35 likes!"
40,15,3,Can someone hand me a pen ?
31,1,0,"I'm sorry, but these mimes are getting out of hand."

34,3,0,What's your super power?
38,10,4,I'm in training for the summer Olympics... Extreme Miming.
39,12,3,The most difficult part is yodeling in mime.
45,14,4,At this altitude we're subject to extreme whiteout conditions.
48,21,9,Why? Because it's air.
35,9,3,I thought I'd try free climbing.
50,35,12,Google Maps got me this far. I'm sticking with it.
38,6,1,Don't even THINK it!

40,6,3,Call that emperor with no clothes guy and see if he has any ideas.
36,6,1,Have I made my point?
37,12,1,All you have to do is be the wall!
46,12,5,"Sure there is no wall, but then again, there is no gravity."
43,11,6,I'm a contrarian. I climbed the mountain because it wasn't there.
35,6,0,"When they build that wall, I'll be ready!"
37,4,3,I just asked for transparency and you make a mountain out of a mole hill.
42,8,4,Am I close?
39,4,4,Just chasing Pokemon.

38,7,4,It's a virtual ladder over the virtual wall.
36,10,0,Your plaster guy is top notch.
39,11,2,"Sssh, don't say it."
41,9,2,It's OK. It's Chicago and the winds are pretty fierce today.
37,4,2,It's not just that! How do you get down from a wall of worry?
39,11,3,The hardest part is always what you can't see.
42,18,4,I studied with Marcel Marceau.
40,12,3,I can't keep this up much longer.
46,16,8,"What part of ""Off-the-Wall"" don't you understand?"
