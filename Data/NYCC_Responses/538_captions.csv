I'm not a big cat person.
Think it over. I'm still the only one here who can use a can opener.
In my defense, the neutering was a requirement of the condo board.
First of all, I'd like to apologize for the whole laser light thing.
I may be a little prick, but at least I'm not a giant pussy.
Don't forget I'm still the only one who knows how to operate the can opener.
Kids, stay in the thimble.
If you are going to rip-up the sofa, you are going to learn how to fix it!
Kill me and the can opener dies with me.
If you eat me, you won't have anyone around to ignore anymore.
Take it easy, pal. She neutered me, too.
So this is what the label meant by "and other side effects."
So! Schrodinger's Cat finally meets String Theory!
He realized then that shrinking himself wasn't his real mistake -- it was getting a cat.
Honey, run the can opener, quick!
Seriously, you'll just cough me up.
One of us is having a bad dream.
"Honey...was the cat food made by Monsanto?
It was then that Bill realized he had made a terrible mistake wishing for "a ton of pussy."
So that would be a no on the cat sweater, then.
I thought I'd sew a pussycat.
Easy now, kitty. How about we work together until we figure out whose dream this is.
One of us is in the wrong cartoon.
Absolutely the last time I cat-sit for Gulliver.
You knew I was a terrible wizard when you married me.
I know this is how you perceive me but in reality I'm twenty times your size and control your food.
What happened to you just ignoring me all the time?
Looks like my wish for a shrink may have been misinterpreted.
Remember how everyone was saying you should be neutered but I said no?
Don't make me call the dog.
Keep in mind I only get one life.
“If you stop calling me, “a little man”, I will stop calling you, “a big pussy”.
Small Lives Matter
Calm down. It's the catnip talking.
Don't come any closer, I'm allergic.
It was then that Archie realized he hadn't paid close enough attention to the non-GMO cat food label.
You seemed much cuter online
I'm afraid things got out of proportion here.
I understand your frustration, but your boots won't be ready until Thursday after 3.
One of us has eaten too many mushrooms.
Kind of wishing I'd grabbed the laser pointer instead.
This is the last time we drop acid and catnip together.
Stay back, I'm allergic
Can't you go back to being aloof?
When the sign said 'World's Biggest Cathouse', I guess I misunderstood.
This situation has gotten completely out of proportion.
I guess you're not a person-cat.
You have nine lives and I have ten needles. Any questions?
If you'd just work with me, I think we have a best selling children's book here.
Look, neither of us want an alteration
I have GOT to start reading the list of side effects with my medication.
I hate being part of the shrinking middle class.
You might be her cat, but I'm her little man, so back off.
So, am I in your dream, or are you in mine?
Either you're a subconscious dream manifestation of my ex-wife, or I'm in really big trouble.
Your OTHER left paw.
'It'll sleep a lot,' she said. 'You'll barely know it's here,' she said.
You need to cooperate for this to become viral.
OK, let's say we reschedule the neutering.
Don't marry a cat lady, they said, but did I listen?
Did I say catgut? I meant nylon.
Okay, I'll stop making dumb internet videos of you. Just reverse the spell.
...and what was your second wish?
Kitty, it's me. I've been downsized.
When I wake up, you'd better be sleeping at the foot of the bed.
This will hurt me more than it will hurt you.
I'm guessing this is a bad time to bring up that you were adopted.
You're going to need to sit still if you want these alterations done.
Oh, now you make eye contact.
Wait wait! The Red Dot! I can show you how to catch it!
Do you solemnly swear to leave the upholstery alone?
You need a shrink.
I wouldn't think such a big pussy would be afraid of a little prick
I said a stitch in time saves nine and yes, all of your lives matter.
Pause the paws and I'll remove the thorn.
I'm more valuable to you alive. I can mend the catnip mouse.
Where's the dog when you need him?
Oh yeah? Good luck working the can opener.
Honey, would you mind putting Precious outside for a while?
How did you get out of the bag?
This was much more fun when you were a kitten.
Honey, the cat's outta the bag...
Honey, I think we can leave the debate over 'shrank' or 'shrunk' for another day.
It said 'condensed milk.' Who knew?
"Take shrinking," they said. "It's the best super power," they said.
Hand over Thumbelina and nobody gets hurt.
It seems as though I've brought a needle to a catfight.
Would it help if I say I'm a big cat lover?
Stand back! This needle is threaded!
I think I liked you better as a kitten.
Does it really even matter whose dream this is?
Last time I take LSD.
Well, I didn't try to eat you when I was the bigger one.
I should have known the genie would confuse my wish for a ton of pussy.
Alice! Where's the pill that makes you larger?
I may be a big pussy, but I'm not afraid of a little prick.
This is the last time I house sit for Stephen King's cat!
I know this is a dream because I don't sew.
You're not what I told the genie I wanted lots of!
Honey, the cat hasn't forgotten we had him neutered.
This is going to hurt me more than it does you.
Tell me where the ball of yarn is, and nobody gets hurt
THIS was the point of my bringing the sewing kit in, kitten.
Why do I always have to be Androcles?
Stop being such a big pussy and let me get that splinter.
Honey! Change the box!
It's the same nightmare - the cat's got my tongue and I'm hanging on by a thread.
I seem to have lost perspective
But you ARE a big pussy!
Hey, Alice -- which one makes you larger?
You were a lot more fun when you weighed three pounds.
Now, what have you done with Thumbelina?
To be honest, I'm not thrilled with you either at the moment.
Alice warned me this might happen.
Curiosity isn't going to be your problem.
Should've taken the blue pill.
Who's the pussy now?
I suppose you realize, now, that "fixed" is just a euphemism.
It's time for the fat cats to answer to the little guys.
C'mon. You're blowing this whole thing out of proportion.
Just remember, I'm the only one who knows where the Friskies are kept!
Sorry about that whole neutering thing
Hey, I think I hear the sound of the can opener!
I'm done playing cat and mouse.
Now do something cute for the Internet.
Ah but you forget, my fearsome foe, that there's more than one way to skin a cat
Back off. I have a needle - and it's threaded.
Relax, I get splinters out of my kids hands all the time.
Wait - is this the dream about health insurance or the one about calling the cable company?
I don't know what has happened to me, but it was Helen who had you neutered.
Or, hear me out, I could teach you how the can opener works
You got the yarn. Now just go.
I'm telling you, it was Louise who insisted on neutering.
Are you sure that was catnip?
C'mon, cough it up.
Why don't we settle this with a nice belly rub?
honey..the cat's out of the bag
Time to find out if I'm a mouse or a man.
That's it! I'm now officially a dog person!
Okay, from now on we're switching to non-GMO milk!
This is because I only put out the dry food isn't it?!
OK, Honey, free the children while I have him distracted
Honey, you were supposed to shrink the kids!
Help me find the antidote and you can have tuna every night.
I'm going to need a spool sample.
Honey, I blew up the cat.
Don't make me use the scissors.
Okay -- I promise we won't use cat gut any more.
I wouldn't be so curious if I were you.
Declawing was just a suggestion...
Yes, you're right to be upset. I'm very sorry we named you "Mr. Snuggles."
You may have claws, but I have opposable thumbs. En garde!
Alice, quick, where’s the other pill?
Well I'll be damned - my wife really IS a witch!
You're taking things out of proportion.
The name is Thumb, Tom Thumb.
Yes, honey-- I believe you now. Please change me back.
Stay back! I know cross-stitch.
Be gentle—this is the only life I've got!
Think about it – am I really worth one of your lives ?
Usually I wake up about now.......
On second thought, I'll just have the vet remove those.
I'm never petsitting for Gulliver again.
Okay,the litter box is full. I'll call the backhoe guy.
What am I, a man or a mouse?
I might be little but I can be a big prick
The cat's out of the bag....and it's bigger than expected.
Don't worry, this will hurt me more than it will hurt you.
Am I a man or a mouse? Seriously?
As soon as I find the "Drink Me" bottle, you're going to be one sorry cat
Oh, now you're interested in me.
Honey, please put the cat out.
If you want to get to my curtains, you're going to have to get through me first.
So, if I mess up, you'll still have eight more lives.
I don't know if you're in my dream or I'm in your dream, but either way I hope one of us wakes up.
"Catgut" is just a brand name.
This will hurt me more than it hurts you.
Mittens, are we stuck in your dream or mine?
OMG! You're right. It's probably ME who's off my meds.
Are you getting this on video?
Neutering was NOT my idea.
How's that cerebral cortex and opposable thumbs working out for you NOW!
See, this is why I'm a dog person.
You should try it. The dog crochets.
Okay! I'm sorry about the neutering thing!
Okay, things seemed to have changed since last night, but I'm still in charge.
Personally, I think you are blowing this little sliver in your paw WAY out of proportion.
I was against having you fixed, remember?
Oh relax. You should be able to take a little needling.
If you don't kill me, the vet bills will.
Taxidermy looked so much easier online.
Calm down - you took some bad catnip.
OK, OK...A cat is man's best friend.
No more GMO cat-nip for you!
I'm sorry about all those YouTube videos of you that I posted.
Exactly what did you do with Thumbelina?
Please tell me you’re litter trained.
It's not fair. You're bigger, stronger and you have nine lives.
Don't you recognize me? Before that damned genie showed up, I'm the one that fed you every day and cleaned out your litter box!
Nevertheless, you see my point.
I got sewing supplies and I'm not afraid to use them.
He quickly realized why the magic beans were in the clearance aisle.
This is going to hurt me more than it's going to hurt you.
Sew...what's new pussycat?
Last chance. Where did you find the steroids.
What catnip induced hallucinations look like from the inside.
Sensitive about our name ....are we Mr. Buttons?
Behind the scenes, The Cat in the Hat was quite harsh with the wardrobe department.
I think I may need to use your litter box.
That's Mister Curiousity to you...
You ruined the couch; I think it's only right that you fix it.
You have me at a disadvantage, Ms. Galore.
It's definitely out of the bag!
I knew this would happen when they took away all our guns.
This is going to hurt me more than it hurts you.
Wow! Jefferson Airplane wasn't kidding about those pills!
Touché
Oh, so now you notice me?
When I said I was making a calico quilt, don’t worry, I didn’t mean you.
I think this is gonna hurt me more than its gonna hurt you.
You're right. I lied. I knew she made the salmon for you and I ate it anyway.
I think someone put catnip in my LSD.
Hey, look over there! A laser dot!
Just remember you're a living organism on this planet, and you're very safe. You've just taken catnip, a heavy drug. Relax, stay inside and listen to some music, Okay? Do you have any Allman Brothers?
Let's keep this in perspective, shall we!
Good. Now STAY!!
Hey, calm down...I'm not the one who decides how vets take your temperature.
I told you, when you "give five" you retract the claws.
Keep up that attitude, and you'll have eight lives.
I'm living in that sewing basket, Buster! Use it as a litter box again and you'll get a lot worse than a jab with a needle!
Things could be worse... I could be allergic to you.
Ask yourself: Am I man or am I mouse?
Cat. Lives. Matter.
You really want to waste one of your lives like this?
Just remember that I'm the little guy who cleans your big litter box.
You look different from your profile photo.
I'm warning you, I know how to cross stitch!
"No more GMO milk for you!'
Think, Max. Think! I'm the guy who changes your litter box!
Just don't lecture me about perspective.
He looked a lot cuter on the internet.
Funny cat video, take two.
If dogs are man's best friend, you must be my ex girlfriend.
Serves me right, for wishing to know what cats dream about.
The thorn is out, but you're going to need stitches.
Thirty years later, and still these damn flashbacks.
No, Honey! Go back to the V.R. program's SIZE drop-down and click on 100%, not 10%. Hurry!
I assure you that I do not taste like chicken.
Before we begin, I would like to apologize for the whole bath thing.
Don't make me mix metaphors.
For Pete's sake, I'm a man, not a mouse.
I can only imagine how this looks from your perspective...
Relax, you're already neutered.
Do you really think I'm afraid of a little prick?
Curiosity killed the man
I know this is going to sound weird... but can you help me come up with a caption for what we're doing here?
Calm down. It's not catgut.
This pussy isn't afraid of a little prick!
I have to clean your dirty litter, and you're the one who's pissed?
Honey, I think I took the wrong pills this morning.
Okay, I get it. You don't like chasing the laser pointer.
You mis-heard me. I said cats are in a basket of ADORABLES.
I think there's a nursery rhyme in here somewhere.
I feel like Roald Dahl would know what to do in my situation
I've got a threaded needle, and I'm not afraid to use it.
I know you probably don't want to hear this right now, but a stitch in time does save nine.
It IS catgut and I'm not afraid to use it!
We've had mice for years, but NOW you're a hunter?
I can't sew your balls back on. They're gone.
I don't know how you did this but remember, if it wasn't for me you'd be clawless and ball-less.
They finally have a cat large enough to catch the rats in the streets of New York.
Whoa...let's just hiss and make up.
Size does matter, doesn't it?
Size matters.
Please remember this will hurt me more then you.
You know what they say about curiosity
After a change in perspective, Harold had fond memories of a less complicated time with his pet rock.
Fine, get yourself another tailor.
Can you please spit up my wife?
you DO realize this is just your mental projection OF me, right?
Stay with me here. A stitch in times saves nine… A cat has nine lives… You’re not following this, are you?
So, this is what you've been planning--all those years just laying there, staring at me.
Mr. Stumpf, CEO of Wells Fargo, meet Senator Elizabeth Warren
Mr. Jingles, please try and understand... Mrs. Thumb was only trying to make you a sweater. Now please cough her back up.
Good. Let's try it again, but this time from the diaphragm.
The tables are turned. Now you sing that damn Meow Mix Song.
What kind of Genie are you? I said I wanted to thread the needle with an F14 Tomcat. Not a 14 year old tomcat!
NOW you pay attention to me.
So what do YOU think, "Darn that cat" means?
I'm warning you...don't get curious.
Wait a minute, will you? Having you neutered was the wife's idea.
Relax. You're just on a bad catnip trip!
Honest, your yarn ball is under the sofa...
Can you believe it, both of us are named Tom!
This is your brain on catnip.
I hope I wake up soon!
I should've run for the laser pointer instead.
Now I'm beginning to wish I hadn't signed those nanoparticle research consent forms.
Honey, did I take the wrong dosage of my medication again?
I promise. No more laser pointer.
This is just a dream. This is just a dream. This is just....
Much to the chagrin of his father, Tom Thumb ultimately dropped out of his veterinary medicine program and went on to pursue a career in the arts.
Laser pointer trick isn’t so funny now little man, is it?
This'll hurt me more than it will you.
Honest, that whole spaying thing was your mom's idea.
No; I don't use Cat Gut.
You'd think with a kid named Tom Thumb, Mom would think twice before bringing home a new pet.
You got your wish, smarty; so who's going to operate the can opener so you can get fed?
I may be tiny, but I'm the one with opposable thumbs.
No, you are not a "fat cat." You are "plus size."
Good news! We held a meeting, and we've decided we won't be neutering you after all.
It's just a sliver. Don't be such a big pussy.
Calm down, Princess, I said play, not spay.
Just don't forget: I'm a man not a mouse.
"I know what you're thinking: have I gone through eight lives, or only seven?
Catgut totally unacceptable; got it.
That's Hollywood, kiddo. Great computer animation. Ridiculous storylines.
I'm a man, not a mouse.
Would you feel better if we switched to wet food?
Just put yourself in my position.
That's all you got? 'MEOW?'
Whose nightmare is this?
Everyone gets out alive. It's a Disney production.
Remember, I just took this OUT of your paw.
Bob Barker's first day in hell.
Why couldn't you be this good at cornering mice?
"I know it's going to hurt, but stop being such a pussy!
Any chance you’d repay the favor that I didn’t have you declawed?
No more needlepoint until you catch those mice.
Woof
You look upset. I can help, I'm a shrink.
The giant cat dream tormented George every year during New York Fashion Week.
No more laser pointer. I promise.
I'm tired of playing cat and mouse.
You're still getting dry food.
You should see my dog.
It's NOT a hairball...I KNOW you've got Alice, now cough her up.
Just so you know, a stitch in time will save all nine of your lives.
Call me a pussy one more time, I dare you.
Uh... woof, woof?
I'm just the taxidermist; it's the vet you should be mad at.
I use a silk thread, not catgut.
Lets see if we can get another year out of this coat.
Actually, I'm the scaredy cat.
I know you're really the pound of cheese I ate at 3 am...but just in case.
I may be small, but the Rotweiler just came up behind you.
Trust me, this video is going viral
Go ahead, make my day.
En garde, fluffy.
Honey. Call the pet store, NOW!
I regret not getting you declawed when I had the chance.
(Just a typical day for a member of America's shrinking middle class.)
Remember this going to hurt me a lot more than you.
Yeah it's Cat Gut!
I'll clean the litter box when I damn well please!
Look, I am not "The Brave little tailor", and you are NOT "Puss in Boots"
I knew I should have had you declawed.
I won't use catgut!
I may be small, but at least I'm not a pussy.
Fine, I'll start buying the premium cat food!
This is going to hurt me more than you
I wish we had you de-clawed before the power plant blew up.
Ok, I had you neutered. You scratched my teak coffee table. That's even in my book.
Maybe we don't need to spay you after all?
I'm sorry, but you need to floss.
Look, you're not making this fitting any easier.
Stop playing with your food!
Androcles was a such a liar...
yes doctor, I think my dream is symbolic. But how does a little prick and an over powering puss have anything to do with my relationship with my wife' Oh yeah there was a string attached as well.
Knit one, purr two.
C'mon, you big pussy!
Oh, darn it!
Relax, this has already been blown way out of proportion.
Look, basically we're both giant pussies.
Got milk?
I never thought I'd say no to pussy.
It'll hurt me more than it'll hurt you
In this final moment of clarity, Alice's tailor regretted several of his decisions.
Don't make me get the knitting needles.
It's just a splinter. Don't be a pussy.
Well, you're not ignoring me anymore, so at least there's that.
Steve, be reasonable. Put the needle down. It was always going to end this way.
I think you're blowing this out of proportion.
This is exactly why I threw out your catnip stash in the first place.
So, that's a 'no' on the pumpkin costume for Halloween this year?
Don't make me call my best friend.
I know Androclese and you are no Androclese!
Am I dreaming, or are you?
This will go viral.
This is definitely going on YouTube.
This is the last time I let my agent talk me into working below scale.
I saw the movie, and I get away.
I know I'm small, but I'm the best darn cat tailor in the county.
I don't care how curious you were. I was dating that goldfish.
*Not drawn to scale*
Listen, would a mouse know how to sew?
You don't look anything like your craigslist photo.
Easy there fella... I still control the food!
The night Dick’s recurrent dream about a big pussy got wilder.
I know the situation has changed a bit between us but you can't be still upset about the laser pointer.
If you'd just stop fighting with me, we could easily turn this into a fable.
I knew I should have paid more attention to that glowing green stuff in your litter box.
Don't make me go 'Hello Kitty' all over your ass.
We both know you're a pussycat, so stop the posturing and let me see the splinter.
This is the last time I eat Chinese food before I go to bed.
Me? Ow!
I'm gonna need a bigger needle!
Believe me, I really don't taste like chicken!
We talked about this before I took the potion; remember?
No hard felines, OK?
I don't care how sweetly you say pussy, I know a little prick, when I see one!
It wasn't my idea to have you neutered.
Bad Mittens!
Ok, ok, I promise: no more science experiments and no more talk of neutering.
It wasn't my idea to get you neutered.
Touché, Pussycat.
If you can strike that pose every time, we're gonna be really big in Vegas.
God, I thought you couldn't get any bossier.
Just so you know, I wasn't the one who saran wrapped the litter box.
Don't worry, I know a guy who got a camel through.
Sure I'm domesticated, but don't push your luck.
This is what we get for living near power lines!
So you lost your mittens. No need for a hissing fit.
It's a play on words, stupid. "Darn cat!"
Imagine the trouble you'll be in when I wake up.
Darn Kitty
On the other hand, have you ever seen a 3 inch talking mouse carrying a threaded needle?
Once you're trained, your going to be an internet sensation. You're gonna be huge!
HONEY! You forgot to shrink the cat!
And here I thought Aunt Nancy was the one who would get eaten by her cats.
You're still a big pussy.
I told them this would happen if they took away our guns.
When I figure out how to take that 'large' pill, you are so declawed.
Watch out, this is threaded!
Where's a laser pointer when you really need one?
You've been feeding at Russia's Olympic training table?
Well, you're not a camel, but then again, I'm not a rich man.
Kids put down the shrink ray, NOW!
New house rule: You scratch it, you sew it.
So, who's the little prick now?
Yes I am sure, send the dog in.
Man, I wish I had Clifford back!
You're less scary than your litter box.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you!
So we meet again, Mr. Bitsypookums.
What was in that catnip?
But I don't want to play cat and mouse.
Don't take it personally, I'm just needling you.
Figures. The mice told me you'd say that.
If you can just settle down for two minutes, we'll both be YouTube celebrities.
Stop toying with me!
I'm just spitballing here, but have you considered going vegan?
Oh, so NOW you'll pay attention to me
Trust me - - fur is so last season.
I didn't declaw you and I fed you organic cat food, and this is the thanks I get?
Okay, I guess you do have the upper hand.
Gulliver arrives on the island of viral videos.
I'm here for my tongue, and I'm not leaving without it.
Sweetie, you're going to be a lot less angry when you see what happened to the dog.
Janet, you won't believe what happened when I rubbed the thimble.
Leave me alone and I promise no more teasing you with the laser pointer, deal?
Put the needle down and nobody gets hurt
Honey, the cats out of the box again.
I'm sorry, but from behind you resemble my pincushion.
Not clothing. I need boots
You just couldn't be happy with a ball of yarn, could you??
Gee, I hope the cat's in my dream and not the other way around.
Relax, I just meant that you're a large cat.
When I wake up, either the cat needs to be let out or my wife is still mad at me.
Who are you calling a pussy?
You're going to be in big trouble when this shrinking potion wears off.
I may be no Tom Thumb, but you're no Puss in Boots.
Would it make any difference if you knew that I'm a Leo?
When I wake up, I think I should talk to my therapist about the symbolic psychosexual meaning of poking at a giant, angry kitty with an oversized needle.
Dam GMO's
Okay fine I will clean your litter box
I'm sorry I made that remark about herding cats.
I'm an on-site button specialist, not a mouse.
I said frayed not spayed!
Yes, I will address you as "The Mighty Mighty Roger, World's Most Powerful Supercat and Ruler of all Carpet and Furniture Dominions." Now will you calm down for a minute and let me back into the lab?
Yes, I was wrong to take selfies of you after bath time and post them online. I'm sorry about your street creds...
Darn?!
I swear - Bob said they were normal mushrooms.
You want the mouse, second floor bedroom on the left.
When I wake up from this dream, I'm going to have you declawed!
Expelliarmus
They were out of yarn.
The catnip was GMO.
This will be so cute on youtube.
Will a stitch in time take nine?
Don't bring a pin to a claw fight.
Stop pawing me or I'll needle you.
Don't hiss at me! I wasn't the one who neutered you!
Breath mint?
OK, I'm ready. But promise me you will never lose your mittens again.
Remember that a stitch in time saves nine lives!
That's it Gizmo, just hold that pose and tomorrow we'll be all over Facebook.
I assure you it's silk thread not cat gut.
Yes. I expect you to fix the trousers you ripped.
No, a "stitch in time saves NINE" DOES NOT refer to cat lives!" Get over it!
If you were Lassie, or even just any dog, I'd be getting the help I need by now.
I thought those mushrooms I foraged looked odd.
Back off, Mittens. I don't know where your stupid ball of yarn is.
No wonder I'm a dog person. Cats always blow everything out of proportion.
Don't worry it's nylon thread, not cat's gut.
Taxidermy nightmare
After this piece, I'll be known as the world's greatest taxidermist, not just the tiniest.
When I previously called you the "devil cat from hell," I simply meant that you were a "beast of great suffering."
Well, now you know what it feels like.
Oh yeah? Well don't forget I've got opposable thumbs
Dang! That genie did warn me about wording my three wishes very carefully.
Of course it's sharp, but that's not the point.
I was just measuring your inseam.
So this is what the brown acid I got at Woodstock was all about.
You got to ask yourself one question... am I feline lucky?
You may have the upper paw now, but guess who's not getting his breakfast when I wake up.
This will probably hurt me more than you.
Silly boy. You should have taken the red pill.
Say it isn't sew.
Cool it, Taffy -- it's just me. Took the wrong blue pill again.
Listen Puss, if you want boots, this is how we start.
No owner - no catnip. Remember that!
Tiny hands, big prick!
Man. Not mouse! Man.
Don't be such a big pussy...this is not going to hurt.
What Would Jerry Do?
Suddenly, this video doesn’t seem so damn cute and funny anymore.
I only said that I needed a yard of calico.
Calico is so yesterday, why don't we go with a nice slimming tabby look?
No one is going to believe this yarn.
Stop, or i'll sew!
Sorry, I'm not a cat person, I'm just a little prick.

Are you sure that a stitch in time saves nine lives?
When you realize wearing mouse scented cologne was a bad idea...
And there stood Larry, out of his comfort sewn.
The cat lobby is more powerful than we thought.
Between my cat and quilting, I'm staring to feel less of a man.
Now roll over and play dead...
I can't open a can either!
It is all a matter of perspective
Glad I didn't go with the blind stitch.
I told you, I can no longer operate the can opener!
Bob Barker sent me.
I would never knowingly put PED's in your milk!
Chill, Tabby! You've brought small claws to a big needle fight.
Did you roll the blue thread under the couch again?

Seriously, the vet said you would live a happier life without them. No more fighting with other males . . .

I know how to use to the can opener.
About that discount cat food...
Yes, that's right, a stitch in time saves nine lives.
You know what I am and I am sure not scared of a little prick.
Some day, Fluffy, I'm going to be big, and THEN you'll be sorry.
If you didn't want stitches, then you shouldn't have been fighting in the alley.
How many times do I have to tell you that sewing requires opposable thumbs?
Prick!
Oh calm down. I'm just going to get the splinter out of your paw, and we'll become best of friends.
You ripped sofa so you have to fix it
So, you finished sewing your costume?
Alright already, I lied about the milk in the thimble!

Let's just say I drew the short straw.
Just because I'm small doesn't mean I can't needle you.
There's more than one way to fence a cat.
It's MY ball of yarn!
I'm Dr. Daniel. Didn't your service let you know I'd be doing your thornectomy today?
Just as I suspected -- Cats don't really love us; they just use us.
O.K., here it is, but I still don't think you can fix that rip before they return.
I have a needle and I'm not afraid to use it!!
OK...not sure how this acupuncture thing really work...
Again I tell you, it is easier for me to go through the eye of this needle than for a fat cat like you to enter the kingdom of God.
I simply cannot make you a mouse skin coat with less than forty skins
Just hold still, Felix. I've done this a thousand times.
If this wasn't a forced perspective shot, I'd be royally screwed.
Okay, Okay, no more Cat Hats!
Just point me in the direction of the goose that lays the golden eggs and no one will get hurt.
Magic Beans he told me...Silver and Gold he told me...Oy...
"Okay. Okay! You'll sing 'Memory' and I'll play the air guitar!
Okay! I agree! The incredible expanding kitty, is a much better title.
Honey! It might be Muffin's nappy time.
Deal . . . you get three mice, a hoop of cheese, and I keep the notions.
Sew be it.

I'll get din-din as soon as I wake up.
This is how you repay me for adopting you?

Really stupid pet tricks

First, you're not a rabbit. But I'm more worried that I took the wrong pill.
Do I look like a mouse to you? Really?
Finding a haystack would have been better.
When I said a little prick, I wasn't talking about your size.
Look, I'm sorry I called you 'flea-bitten furball factory'. Now will you back off?
Ok,ok, I did cut the cheese.
If you're patient I'll take you to the world's largest ball of yarn.

I'll leave you in stitches, ya big pussy!
Sorry, I should have been kinder to you on my way up.
Back off or you won't get pajamas.
Frank, we have had this conversation already. Just because you invented a shrink ray and a cat translator does not mean I will overlook your frankly vacuous views on the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
Sew what?

Ok, I guess I'll play with you.
Schrödinger's cat is very much alive!

I will not wear a sweater like the dog!
The problem is not as small as you think, Mr. Whiskers

I said I wanted yarn
I was told I'd be adopting a domestic cat.
There may be some lingering resentment.

Bark bark?
You're not so indifferent now.
Okay, so the lady pays me to fix the curtain, then I bring you some catnip the next time you rip it up. Deal?
This could end as quite a yarn.
Look, I'm not excited about this either. You swallowed the rubber band ball.

Well, you needle me all the time too.
Time to get back into the bag.
No, I don't remember squirting you with a squirt gun.
Well, Mr. Trump, I'm afraid that if you want to be president, you're going to have to learn how to thread the needle yourself.
Are you sure you want to do this yourself?
And to think that all of those feedings and pettings have come to this.
Have I ever told you the story about the Lion and the Mouse?
I know, pedicure time is challenging.

Remember who is master here.
Fluffy, you're not getting the point.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, everybody's got a yarn to share
Give me back my tongue, Cat!
I told you...don't use the Giant Redwood as a scratching post.

Here's the bigger point.
I know I promised but they were out of the wet food.
Tut-tut, Whiskers. Gratitude is the sign of noble souls. I remove the thorn; you procure the HGH.

You've just gotten way too big for your stitches.
A stitch in time will save nine of your lives.
I've crocheted a monster!
You're supposed to be smiling!!!! I gotta quit reading Lewis Carroll before going to bed.

I've never liked you and you've never liked me. This ends here.

I promise - this is not catgut suture.

Thumbelina is on sabbatical, so there are going to be a few changes around here.
I don't know who's been walking through your cat food, but it wasn't me.

It's not catnip. It's my aftershave.
Got it - you don't need the mittens after all. Maybe a new pair of pajamas then?
