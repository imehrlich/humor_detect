4144,4028,0,11,69,80,1.1375,0.03874515077865563,681,I wouldn’t hang around this place much longer.
4154,4028,1,9,70,80,1.1375,0.042633817622437835,681,I thought we going on 3.......!
4161,4028,0,11,69,80,1.1375,0.03874515077865563,681,Don’t be a tough guy.  Don’t be a fool.  I will call you later.
4164,4028,1,9,70,80,1.1375,0.042633817622437835,681,Haven't you heard?  It's time for the fall.
3561,4028,2,7,71,80,1.1375,0.04619629964906088,681,Don't worry - I'm fine with Salutatorian.  Congratulations!

3094,4028,0,11,69,80,1.1375,0.03874515077865563,681,"If I see her, I'll tell her to meet you here."
3427,4028,0,11,69,80,1.1375,0.03874515077865563,681,At least this year John swapped his rake for a blower.
2788,4028,0,11,69,80,1.1375,0.03874515077865563,681,I've never liked the idea of conforming.
2808,4028,2,7,71,80,1.1375,0.04619629964906088,681,Hey....don’t leaf me all alone!

2899,4028,2,7,71,80,1.1375,0.04619629964906088,681,See you in Capistrano!
2903,4028,1,9,70,80,1.1375,0.042633817622437835,681,I'm sorry to leave you but I have reservations at the place we watched blossom across the street.
2935,4028,1,9,70,80,1.1375,0.042633817622437835,681,"Ah, if we once go to see them in the city!"
2963,4028,0,11,69,80,1.1375,0.03874515077865563,681,"Goodbye Taylor, it's time we broke off this relationship."

2986,4028,0,11,69,80,1.1375,0.03874515077865563,681,...and then he felt truly and absolutely leafed behind
2994,4028,2,7,71,80,1.1375,0.04619629964906088,681,Finally finished my photosynthesis!
3007,4028,0,11,69,80,1.1375,0.03874515077865563,681,Didn't you hear the rumors of coming winter?
3059,4028,1,9,70,80,1.1375,0.042633817622437835,681,Let’s try to be a spruce in our next incarnation.
3062,4028,0,11,69,80,1.1375,0.03874515077865563,681,Last One out of Beech City...
3383,4028,2,7,71,80,1.1375,0.04619629964906088,681,I think this is the end of our relationship!

3260,4028,3,5,72,80,1.1375,0.049503068566184395,681,See you next autumn.
3248,4028,0,11,69,80,1.1375,0.03874515077865563,681,"Sorry to leave, but  I couldn't help falling. 'Tis the season!"
3240,4028,0,11,69,80,1.1375,0.03874515077865563,681,Why do all my girlfriends leaf me?
3495,4028,1,9,70,80,1.1375,0.042633817622437835,681,I call shotgun!
3222,4028,0,11,69,80,1.1375,0.03874515077865563,681,Time to migrate “Down under”… the snow!
3156,4028,0,11,69,80,1.1375,0.03874515077865563,681,Dave don't leaf me!
3148,4028,1,9,70,80,1.1375,0.042633817622437835,681,"I hope for cremation, not compose."
3137,4028,2,7,71,80,1.1375,0.04619629964906088,681,We're drop dead gorgeous!
5515,4028,1,9,70,80,1.1375,0.042633817622437835,681,We weren't right for each other anyway.
3109,4028,1,9,70,80,1.1375,0.042633817622437835,681,"Goodbye, Donald. It’s just you alone now."
4184,4028,0,11,69,80,1.1375,0.03874515077865563,681,"It's just a matter of time now, and there's nothing you can do about it."
3165,4028,1,9,70,80,1.1375,0.042633817622437835,681,Till we meet again...
4186,4028,1,9,70,80,1.1375,0.042633817622437835,681,I THINK WE ARE FALLING
4483,4028,1,9,70,80,1.1375,0.042633817622437835,681,Every branch has a silver lining
4235,4028,1,9,70,80,1.1375,0.042633817622437835,681,Who knows? The salad days may be yet to come.

4942,4028,0,11,69,80,1.1375,0.03874515077865563,681,"Don't be scared. After the first big drop, the ride's a breeze."
4964,4028,1,9,70,80,1.1375,0.042633817622437835,681,Will you marry me???
4969,4028,1,9,70,80,1.1375,0.042633817622437835,681,I just can't take your annoying updates any more.  You think you're the only one losing color?
4984,4028,1,9,70,80,1.1375,0.042633817622437835,681,We should have invested in evergreens.
4999,4028,0,11,69,80,1.1375,0.03874515077865563,681,I haaavve chaaannged!

5053,4028,0,11,69,80,1.1375,0.03874515077865563,681,How did I fall for that?
5058,4028,1,9,70,80,1.1375,0.042633817622437835,681,I think it's time we went separate ways.
5060,4028,0,11,69,80,1.1375,0.03874515077865563,681,Don't forget to lock the door.
5073,4028,0,11,69,80,1.1375,0.03874515077865563,681,You knew I'd eventually fall for you.

5174,4028,0,11,69,80,1.1375,0.03874515077865563,681,Sorry about the break  up.
5198,4028,0,11,69,80,1.1375,0.03874515077865563,681,Do you believe in reincarnation?
5225,4028,0,11,69,80,1.1375,0.03874515077865563,681,It’s not your fault. I changed.
5257,4028,1,9,70,80,1.1375,0.042633817622437835,681,Now I understand what it means to fall for someone.

5339,4028,1,9,70,80,1.1375,0.042633817622437835,681,I leave you with your reincarnation theory.
5383,4028,1,9,70,80,1.1375,0.042633817622437835,681,"Finally, I can leave! I thought the year was never going to end."

5455,4028,2,7,71,80,1.1375,0.04619629964906088,681,I'm falling for you and that's exactly why I must leave.
5503,4028,1,9,70,80,1.1375,0.042633817622437835,681,"They say it's not the impact that gets you, but rather the heart attack on the way down."

4869,4028,0,11,69,80,1.1375,0.03874515077865563,681,I warned them about climate change.
4829,4028,0,11,69,80,1.1375,0.03874515077865563,681,The horror! The horror!
4826,4028,1,9,70,80,1.1375,0.042633817622437835,681,Sorry I have to 'leaf' like this.
4240,4028,0,11,69,80,1.1375,0.03874515077865563,681,"Ok, sweetheart, I lied about one little thing: I am scared of heights!"

4320,4028,0,11,69,80,1.1375,0.03874515077865563,681,I thought I had more time.
4321,4028,1,9,70,80,1.1375,0.042633817622437835,681,But you said O. Henry drew us!
4326,4028,0,11,69,80,1.1375,0.03874515077865563,681,What do you mean you got busy and just forgot? You had all summer to book us a spot!
4363,4028,2,7,71,80,1.1375,0.04619629964906088,681,It’s fall time baby.
4385,4028,0,11,69,80,1.1375,0.03874515077865563,681,"No collusion! It was a perfect conversation. I’m not a puppet, I’m a leaf! I must be the worst treated leaf in the history of leaves! This is a witch hunt and they’re gonna burn me..."

4532,4028,0,11,69,80,1.1375,0.03874515077865563,681,"Don't forget, Russell, last one who leaves turns out the lightest."

4804,4028,0,11,69,80,1.1375,0.03874515077865563,681,The shredder waits for no leaf.
4777,4028,1,9,70,80,1.1375,0.042633817622437835,681,"Gotta go now!  You think that's why they call us ""leaves""?"
4737,4028,0,11,69,80,1.1375,0.03874515077865563,681,I think I'll go for a reverse two and a half followed by a pike.
4730,4028,1,9,70,80,1.1375,0.042633817622437835,681,Tis the season for separation anxiety

4569,4028,1,9,70,80,1.1375,0.042633817622437835,681,"Well, obviously you don’t want to be part of the fall crowd!"
