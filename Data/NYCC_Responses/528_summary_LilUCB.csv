19,2,1,I thought we'd try a different angle.
17,1,0,"and so unlike frolf, board room see-saw never really caught on."

19,1,1,This is not a good sign that he's willing to negotiate.
18,1,1,Whoops!
21,3,2,This more accurately represents the corporate balance of power.
17,1,0,To demonstrate the sliding scale of our new salaries ...

18,0,0,Boxers
18,5,0,This office needs to be on an even keel.
17,2,0,"As you might have figured out, our balance sheet is a bit off this quarter."

20,5,6,Everyone seated around this table has an equal vote.
18,2,0,welcome to Gravity Inc.
20,5,1,I truly believe your point of view is skewed.
17,3,0,Your opinions carry great weight.
19,6,2,I expect you all to work at full-tilt.
17,3,0,"Rearranging the chairs is a good first step, but will it make us great again?"
20,4,1,NOW do you understand the gravity of the situation?
17,0,0,The glass ceiling just got a little further away.
19,0,0,You're all going down!
20,3,2,"Okay, this meeting is going downhill fast"
20,4,2,"In hindsight, we should have re-framed the window instead."
19,2,1,"""So, what brings you to the conclusion that we're developing employee factions?"
18,0,0,We're shifting gears.
19,4,2,Anyone have a breath mint?
18,2,0,Welcome to the first corporate retreat to be held aboard a cruise ship.
21,2,3,Your probably wondering why I've cornered you all here today.
18,2,0,I don't care. History is rarely on the side of consensus
21,3,2,"Look, I stand by my Engineer. He says it's good, it's good."
21,1,2,I just don't think any of you are on my level.
20,4,1,And that is why this is the last Frank Gehry building we will commission.
21,5,3,I'm inclined to feel the same as all of you.
17,0,0,What? Am I the only one who drank a 'V8' this morning?
19,4,2,I called this meeting to discuss certain downward trends.
18,1,1,I said I have a ZipCar not Zika
18,1,0,"The vote is complete, the high has it."
18,1,0,"In my company, nobody simply slides by!"
20,0,2,And what a great pleasure it is to have our first board meeting on the Titanic.
19,7,0,"Remember people, a rising tide doesn't lift all boats."
18,0,0,Is it theoretical physics or a mere political leaning?
20,3,1,I know we are sinking but I have another amazing new idea
17,1,0,"As you know, we're all equals around here."
19,1,1,"Now team, is the building tipping or the window crooked?"
18,3,0,"Sorry, next time I'll try to cover my mouth."
18,1,1,"The earthquake doesn't excuse you, I excuse you."
19,4,1,Harold is rocking the boat - again
19,7,1,I'm leaning that direction too.
18,4,0,Get the consultant. Our feng shui is awry.
18,2,0,I hope you're all enjoying our leadership cruise. Today we're going to discuss bailouts.
20,0,1,Our unique rotating window frame is particularly useful on cruise ships and in areas prone to sinkholes.
20,2,3,"I said raise your hand, not hands"
17,0,0,"When I took the chair, I warned you that cutting corners would put you in a tight corner."
17,0,0,No more affirmative collective leaning-in. It's a new ball game where I want to see what each of you has to bring to the table.
17,2,0,You'll need to lean in.
20,1,1,OK Guys...Great News! Scientist has confirmed continuous use of deodorant has no effect on the Ozone Layer.
18,2,0,I'm pleased to call the first meeting of the Divergent Thinking Task Force to order.
18,1,0,"Now, why am I right?"
19,4,1,I like talking down to you.
18,2,0,I called you here today to discuss the importance of using a level.
19,4,0,I know: This is going to be an uphill battle.
18,0,0,My first order of business is to level the playing field.
18,0,0,"Ah, to be a white cis hetero male named John . . ."
18,2,0,"""I believe the business has finally turned a corner""."
17,0,0,"Apparently, you've chosen to 'Lean In'."
19,2,1,Like Trump I'm taking the company in a new direction without directors.
17,1,0,"Some places give you the Ax..I prefer the ""guillotine table"""
18,1,1,I'm with you in spirit.
19,1,1,I thought we'd move this meeting along faster if I have you all seated together in the peanut gallery.
19,5,1,I don't think you people are on the level with me.
19,3,1,I have been sent to assure you that the system is not rigged.
21,3,2,I like the way you all look up to me.
19,4,0,"I understand your point about the 1%, but actually, right here right now, I'm 12.5%."
18,4,1,"As you may have noticed, our company is experiencing a downturn."
18,0,0,"I'm the new CEO, and I'd like to start off with a clean slate."
20,2,1,Downsizing
20,4,2,As you know there has been a shift in the market.
17,0,0,"OK, now one at a time. Climb on the table over to me"
18,2,0,"Now imagine, instead of a sinking ship, you were drowning in red ink."
19,4,0,"As your new Prime Minister, I ask that you join me in taking on Brexit full tilt."
16,0,0,We're ramping up sales this month!
18,2,0,Management has combined its horizontal and vertical integration policy to corner the best talent pool in the market.
19,6,0,"I'm going to level with you,the firm has decided to move in another direction."
18,3,0,"Give it to me straight, guys."
18,0,1,First let's establish the ground rules: Le crayon n'est pas sur la table.
17,3,0,I'm happy to report that things are looking up.
20,5,0,You guys asked for the board retreat on a cruise.
17,0,0,It should now be clear. Gravity rules.
20,3,2,You all have equal rights. In this company we take pride in offering a level playing field.
18,1,0,"No, I didn't endorse Trump. I voted for him before I voted against him."
18,2,0,This is a metaphor come to life isn't it?
18,6,0,"OK, you all are Europe and I'm Britain."
19,4,1,Tell me a time you went above and beyond.
18,1,0,My lawyer drafted a great term sheet.
20,2,2,Impressed? Now let's take that vote again
17,2,0,This way I corner all of you at the same time
19,1,1,my wheels stuck
18,0,0,Those in favor please move to the back of the room!
19,3,0,"Evidently, there's has been a slide in our latest earnings report."
18,2,0,marco. polo.
18,5,0,I guess avant-garde architecture isn't always what it's cracked up to be.
21,0,3,First I want to thank each of you for weighing in on the new strategic plan.
19,7,0,What's say we let this motion slide?
18,1,0,"Ladies and gentlemen of the long range planning committee, in answer to your many questions, all I have to say is "" In the world we now live in, there are no right angles."""
20,3,1,Duly noted.
17,1,1,I need you all to throw your weight behind me.
20,4,0,Let's put a new slant on things ...
20,5,1,Being at the head of the table has it's advantages.
18,1,1,Looks like the whiteboard didn't get the memo...
19,0,1,"At the risk of showing my bias, I'd say we need a new slant on the matter."
21,4,0,"Ladies and gentlemen, we have leverage!"
18,1,1,Imagine you're on a sinking ship while we brainstorm Brexit strategy.
16,1,0,The gravity of the situation is clearly not in my favor.
20,4,1,Maybe we shouldn't have chosen Pisa for our corporate offices.
20,5,1,This board carries too much weight.
20,4,1,"Mr. Dibbles, that's NOT the best way to make the sales chart trend upward."
18,3,0,"As the Boss, my chair wheels came with safety locks."
18,1,1,"Clearly, our demographics are leaning to the Right."
18,1,0,"No no, what I said was gather the CHAIR holders"
19,2,0,Welcome to See-Saws-R-Us.
18,1,1,Our last board meeting on the Titanic shall please come to order!
17,0,0,"Now, it's true that some might say that I'll do anything to tilt the process in my favor, but I frankly I have no idea where such accusations come from."
17,2,0,Lesson One: Power does NOT level the playing field.
20,2,2,The motion on the floor is to remove the rollers from the chairs.
18,0,0,"Yes, it's a bit distracting, but I'm told everyone in the Bay Area is doing it."
18,0,0,I thought we could save a lot of time at this get-acquainted meeting.
18,0,0,"Hold on. Hold on! If you slide in less than thirty seconds, you're fired."
19,1,1,You are firing me?
17,0,0,I see you get my slat on this topic.
21,3,1,"And lastly, I'm inclined to ask HR for a department wide raise of 25 degrees."
18,2,0,Good morning! I'm here to explain our sliding-scale performance review process.
20,3,2,"I'm known as a mover and a shaker, but my specialty is tilter."
20,2,1,I don't need to tell any of you that things have been going downhill fast around here lately!
17,1,0,"Your body language tells me your company is leaning towards a ""no"" on the deal."
21,2,2,What is it that makes you think I don't value your opinion?
20,3,1,I don't like talking down to you.
17,3,0,Clearly the weight of evidence supports my view.
17,0,0,We believe disrupting the status quo starts at home.
19,3,1,Please Cross Your Legs Miss Simpson !
18,2,0,You didn't lean in!
12,3,0,Pardon the paradigm shift
19,3,0,"Now, it may appear to you that my viewpoint is slanted..."
20,2,2,I get it. I have bad breath.
17,2,0,Why so scared? They just hung the TV a bit crooked.
17,0,0,So who ordered the all-you-can-eat lunch special?
18,1,0,Most of you warned me about the foundation. I just didn't listen.
19,1,1,"There you go again, talking down to your employees."
18,1,0,"So what do you guys think, should we invest in the video conference equipment?"
20,7,3,Very funny guys. Now straighten the picture and move your chairs back to the table.
20,2,2,Simply place your hand on the table if you disagree.
18,0,0,WHY ARE THERE ALWAYS EARTHQUAKES AT OUR MEETINGS????????????????
19,3,0,"With you in my corner, anything is possible."
21,3,2,You realize the italics in the meeting agenda are intended for emphasis only.
20,6,2,It appears the market has shifted.
18,1,1,All of the staff is now being evaluated on a sliding scale.
18,6,0,"Well, we knew Pisa wasn't to code when we moved in."
20,4,0,"I want to welcome you all to the first meeting of the Board of Trustees of the Mystery Spot of St. Ignace, Michigan."
20,5,1,"Okay, me next--ready?"
18,2,0,Ok who wants to go first?
20,4,1,Is it bothering anyone else that that window is crooked?
18,6,0,Which one of you signed off on the architect?
18,1,1,I am sorry to report that the downward trend will continue for the foreseeable future.
20,3,1,I thought you'd all be leaning the other way.
18,2,0,"Yet ironically, all your 401k plans are up."
18,2,0,I want to brainstorm today as to why our contracting business has fallen so precipitously as of late.
18,2,0,Who was it that suggested we have the next board meeting on a cruise?
19,5,0,"And this is why, I believe, I should be named interim captain"
18,3,0,I can certainly understand your perspective...
20,2,1,Should we waive the reading of the minutes?!
19,1,1,All those in favor of reducing the amount of garlic in the cafeteria pizza say aye.
19,5,1,I'm told that you have a bunch of new ideas.
18,0,0,Don't panic. I'm confident we'll get bailed out: we're too big to fail.
17,5,0,I wish you guys could see this from my perspective.
19,1,1,Does tipping to the right signify anything in particular?
21,1,2,It appears the weight of evidence has shifted in your favor. You win!
18,2,0,"I thought for a change , I would deliver your checks to you personally ."
17,2,0,"Now that we've got wheels on our chairs, we're really on a roll."
19,1,0,Doesn't anyone feel there's an upside to the project?
20,5,2,I thought having today's staff meeting on my yacht would be a good idea . . . But apparently not.
17,6,0,I was really hoping we could meet in the middle on this one.
19,4,1,Holding our board meeting at sea may have not been the best ideal.
17,1,0,"If this company is going to be successful, I need everyone to lean in."
17,2,0,"Yes The Board has weighed in your favor, but..."
17,0,0,"Hey, people! Where's your team spirit!???"
17,1,0,"So, do we have a deal? This can go higher, you know."
18,4,0,Advancement is an uphill climb - not everyone will make it!
17,2,0,"As you know, we all are here to restore political balance to the media so please begin the arduous trek towards the center of the table."
18,1,1,You are all aware by now that things are not tilted in your favor.
20,5,3,"First, let me address the rumors that the company is foundering."
18,1,1,Aw-choo! Must've brought back that thing everybody's catching in Brazil. ...
19,11,1,I'm sure you're aware of the gravity of the situation.
18,2,0,"Sure, we can add that to the agenda."
18,2,0,"From where I sit, the view of the majority seems rather slanted."
20,4,1,You don't like the angle I'm coming from?
19,1,1,I'd like to start the meeting by apologizing for the garlic sausage I had at lunch.
18,3,0,"This is a board room, not a playing field!"
19,0,1,You should know this crop you're buying is genetically modified.
19,0,0,"Have no fear, rewards will come."
20,3,1,"I now call to order, our meeting of Nelophobics Anonymous!"
19,1,1,"Next time we meet in Pisa, be sure to reserve chairs without casters."
14,2,0,"It's called corporate malfeasance. It's troubling, but not contagious."
18,3,0,"From my own perspective, team, it's all down hill from here."
17,8,0,Leaving this meeting will be an uphill battle.
18,2,0,I'm glad I'm one of them
18,0,1,Is there any question about the gravity of the situation?
19,3,1,What makes you think we don't have a level playing field?
20,5,2,So that's how we roll
20,5,3,Don't everyone volunteer at once.
19,1,1,I think we may have reached the tipping point.
18,2,0,I've decided to grant your request for a safe space.
18,2,0,"So, you think this organization is a little bit slanted? Why would you say that?"
20,2,2,One more weighted opinion and I let go of the table.
19,4,0,"Don't worry shipmates, the table is bolted to the floor."
20,1,2,Sorry guys. Your ideas were good; but Mr. Hendricks wants to take the business in another direction.
20,0,2,I wanted a fresh slant on our Chapter 11 decision.
20,2,1,Does anyone else smell that?
18,2,0,People –there is no democracy on a boat.
20,2,2,welcome back
18,1,0,"As the new Salmon Fisheries CEO, Ted realized he had his work cut out for him."
18,0,0,Let me say it again: the field is leveled.
18,1,0,You asked for a democracy.
19,5,0,Managing this company is an uphill roll.
20,5,1,"Before we begin, would someone please straighten the whiteboard? It's hanging crooked."
17,3,0,Renting office space at the Tower of Pisa was destined to present some problems.
20,0,1,It's MY table and you'll cry if I say so!
18,1,0,I sense it will take awhile for the impact of Brexit to fade.
19,0,1,"First, I'd like to welcome you to the Monopolies Commission"
18,2,0,I recognize the need to flatten our organization.
19,4,0,"We have found that, when your back is up against the wall, board members are more apt to make the right decision."
17,0,0,Okay not more pickled eggs before Monday meeting.
20,5,2,I see you have the majority in your corner.
18,1,0,"When the building sways the other way, I want a high-five from everyone on the way out."
19,3,1,"Sorry, this is as level as the playing field is gonna get!"
19,7,1,I think that picture might be crooked.
19,4,2,And we saved nearly 20% having the construction done by Bob's brother in-law.
19,3,1,Apparently the line graph wasn't clear enough
18,1,0,Twitter Capturing Paul Ryan and the Republican Congress Sliding Into Oblivion
17,2,0,"I need your very best efforts on this one, as getting the account will be an uphill battle"
20,2,2,I know it's the picture frame.
18,2,0,"From this angle, our numbers look fine."
21,2,2,Is that your final answer?
18,2,0,I think the argument is tilting in your direction
20,7,3,Watch what happens when I let go of this table.

18,1,0,"Sorry about this, guys - the cartoonist flunked perspective in art school."
18,1,0,I said pivot not tilt
18,0,0,"So in conclusion, having a sliding scale for your business is just not a good idea."
18,2,0,Did you meet anyone you knew on the way down?
17,0,0,There's safety in numbers dumbkoff !
18,1,0,You never should have told him to invade Iraq.
18,2,0,Try gluing your hands to the table.
18,3,0,"OK, who pressed Tilt?"
18,2,0,I know my views are a little slanted but hear me out.
17,1,0,Alright. Which one of you has my notes?
17,3,0,Perhaps we can do without the casters?
18,1,1,Just so you know... everything here is based on a sliding scale.
19,5,0,I AM on your side!
17,2,0,Could you pass the salt?
19,4,1,Profits aren't the only thing that have taken a dip this quarter.
19,5,1,"Now that we have established the appropriate balance of power, we may commence our meeting."
19,0,1,I'm at 1% right now
20,4,1,"Obviously, you were invited to this focus group because you all lean to the right."
18,3,0,"Well, now you have my slant on it."
17,1,0,"Come on people, keep up!"
18,0,0,It's called gum.
18,4,0,"Okay, I think I've held the table long enough so I'm gonna pass it one of you."
18,1,0,Don't put your life into perspective. Conquer perspective!
18,0,0,Does anyone object to me as ex officio chairman of this committee?
17,1,1,"So it's all downside, huh?"
20,4,2,"...also on the agenda, we will be asking the City of Pisa to renew our lease."
21,2,2,"Clearly, our perspectives are different!"
18,3,0,board meeting on the Edmund Fitzgerald
17,1,0,I don't think this is how a weighted vote works.
21,3,2,"If I don't have an answer in 30 seconds, I let go of the table."
17,2,0,When I release this table anyone left alive will still be employed
20,1,1,I feel a little outweighed here
20,2,2,Considering the gravity of the situation . . .
19,1,1,"I had the Limberger cheese, garlic and onion egg salad. What did you have?"
18,3,0,It rolls downhill.
18,1,0,"You may all disagree, but I have the upper hand."
19,2,0,"""Hold on because we will now be measuring your work performance on the new sliding scale."
18,1,0,I have the sense you think I'm slanted on this issue.
18,1,0,What new amazing App have I developed this period?
18,1,0,"As you know, we've had a bit of a downturn..."
18,2,0,"Half of you think that the country has tilted to the right, and the other half think it has tilted to the left. I would like to offer a different perspective..."
20,3,1,I'm here to tell you that the balance of power has shifted.
18,3,0,"Sorry about the ""Triple Garlic Lover's Sandwich"" I had for lunch."
18,1,0,No bosses in my boardroom!
20,1,2,"Of course, these changes will affect some of us more than others."
17,2,0,I said raise your hands if you agree.
18,3,0,The table is hereby motioned.
18,0,0,What axis does work start at?
18,0,0,"Members of the Board, did I mention our ""Rough Seas Ahead"" simulation?"
20,4,1,"Come on guys, my wife always makes me tuna for lunch."
18,4,0,The board's unanimous decision to remove me as CEO leaves me no choice but to table further deliberations.
19,5,1,I know some of you are wondering how you got on the list.
18,2,0,"Prepare, for it is foretold that when the shadow of Trump Tower falls upon this table, we shall all be made great again."
21,3,1,"Let me start by saying, 'our news media is free and balanced.'"
18,1,0,"C'mon guys, all I did was ask if Brexit is really such a bad thing."
18,1,0,No let's put this into perspective.
20,4,2,I can't hold the table much longer...
18,0,0,"Oh, grandmother, what big eyes you have!"
19,4,2,I get it. Your work-life balance is off.
18,1,0,"If Trump wins, you and the missis can come stay with us."
18,2,0,Interviewers: Where do you see yourself five years from now? Interviewee: On the other side of this table.
18,7,0,Today's study group seems a bit one-sided.
20,3,1,Now that understand the balance of power shall we move on to 'trickle down economics'?
16,3,0,This is huge! First one across the table is my Vice President.
19,1,1,I regret to inform you that this merger has created an unfortunate leadership imbalance.
19,6,0,This was the most ergonomic way for me to look down on you all.
21,3,2,As if to prove my point that too many on our team have become dead weight...
17,0,0,"Believe me, we need to look at it for all angles."
19,6,0,We don't need a bar graph to tell us how things have been going.
18,0,0,ok... if I don't vote for him will you come back to the table? I'm getting sea sick.
23,4,4,Some of you may be wondering if the Board is properly balanced.
19,5,2,The balance of power has shifted.
18,1,0,It's unanimous then. I'm the foreman.
19,5,2,Thank you for participating in this focus group - how are you enjoying the cruise so far?
19,3,1,Bonuses will be based on altitude.
18,0,0,"We subscribe to the ""Hussein"" management style at this company."
19,5,1,I suggest we adjourn before we hit the next wave
18,4,0,I think you're leaning in the wrong direction.
18,1,0,Does your planet have species neutral bathrooms?
18,0,0,We need to level set.
18,0,0,we're all done with just coasting along
18,3,0,"It was not an Earthquake, Now lets get back to work!!"
19,4,2,You actually have to ask why no coffee and donuts today!
19,1,1,I guess we should re-think the recipe of our new breath mints.
18,0,1,I think we can all see why tuna toothpaste was a failure.
18,1,0,"Trust me, I think we can straighten this out. Janet, how's it looking for wheel-removal in the next quarter?"
21,1,1,We are leaning towards no but will keep your resume on file.
18,7,0,Corporately we believe all crap rolls down hill.
23,6,5,Do I need to remind you what rolls downhill?
20,3,1,Is anyone proficient in slant hand ?
18,1,1,The level playing field is highly overrated.
18,0,0,My first act will be to change the chairs of this board.
19,4,1,I am unmoved by the gravity of consensus.
18,1,0,I've called you all here this morning to give you my slant on the firm's new personnel policies.
20,4,1,No matter what. We are fair and balanced.
17,1,0,I think we need to revisit these castor chairs.
18,1,0,We cut some corners and we're about to pay the price big time.
18,2,0,No need to be afraid.
18,1,0,Something tells me you're all leaning in a different direction on the subject.
19,1,1,"AS I have explained before, there is no such thing as a level playing field, that is why you are down there and I am up here."
19,5,0,"Despite the rumors, the company is not going down."
21,3,2,Whose brilliant idea was it to hold our board meeting on a cruise ship?
20,1,2,I feel a disturbance in the floors.
20,4,2,"Practical, no. Demoralizing, yes."
17,0,0,So no one's volunteering to do publicity for Kanye?
18,2,0,"Keep up, people."
20,2,3,You think my opinions are skewed?
17,0,0,"Yes, this quarter your company is facing both a slippery slope and an uneven playing field!"
19,3,1,"When I said you were all on my list, this is not what I meant."
19,0,0,Seasickness is no excuse not to participate.
19,3,0,Let me give you my slant on the new sales projections.
19,3,1,"Although I am at the top, things will ""trickle down""."
18,2,0,Welcome to our first deferred maintenance re-conceptualization workshop!
17,2,0,"I know. It may not seem like this deal is on the level,"
17,0,0,'Tell all the truth but tell it slant' is now a reality.
17,0,0,I'm literally above the rest of you on this project.
18,0,0,Our next lesson wil be 'wheel-locking-during-room-tilts'!
18,2,0,I know it seems like we're a bit at sea here...
18,4,1,So it's 7 to 1 in favor of chairs with no wheels.
18,1,0,"Listen, you small people !"
21,2,2,Cutting edge design has consequences.....
17,2,0,The vote seems to tilt right...
18,3,0,I'd like to propose a different slant on the problem.
18,3,0,What's all this talk about the one percent?
19,6,0,But building without a foundation saved us a lot of money.
16,3,0,Anyone remember the story of the Titanic?
18,0,0,Given the circumstances I'd say the 'nay' has the vote.
20,3,1,Our key goal is to create a level playing field.
20,2,1,"Now, I don't want you to feel I don't value your opinions"
18,0,0,I swear that was a one time thing.
20,5,1,I always knew our board of directors carried a lot of weight.
18,0,1,Any new items for the Leaning Tower coop board?
18,0,0,"For chrissakes, do we look like windmills?"
19,6,2,Our world has shifted and we must respond.
17,1,0,"Well, now raises roll downhill too."
18,2,0,Welcome to our right leaning focus group.
19,4,0,This is what I mean by top down management.
20,7,2,I never promised you a level playing field
18,1,0,I wanted a new slant on things and to not let things slide.
19,12,2,"Is it just me, or does that picture seem crooked?"
18,2,0,"If I may sir, speaking on behalf of our group your picture needs ""straightening""."
16,2,0,Usually these negotiations are tilted in the other direction.
19,3,0,"I'm the boss here, and I decide how level the playing table will be."
18,0,0,Welcome to Mediation Magnet.
17,0,0,I told you we need a new business plan to keep things stable
18,2,0,I forgot and had Mexican food for lunch. Sorry!
19,7,1,I hope this helps you understand the gravity of the situation
17,2,0,That's not really what I meant about rearranging the deck chairs
19,4,1,"Ok, so `fair and balanced' is a bad slogan."
17,1,0,"All those in favor of concluding our maiden staff meeting aboard the Titanic, say aye!"
21,2,3,"I meant ""we need a heavy weight on the board"" figuratively."
18,3,0,I see you all sided with gravity on this matter.
18,3,0,"Let me tell you, I am not a believer in optical illusion."
18,1,0,How about a show of hands?
18,3,0,"Mr. Tilt, we don't like the slant that you're putting on the TPI reports. It's kind of making the company look crooked."
19,8,1,You need to understand the gravity of our situation.
17,2,0,I take it we're leaning right.
17,3,0,"So, how do you feel about my proposal?"
18,1,1,"Now don't worry. As you all know, it's my job to right the ship."
18,0,0,Now you're all in breach of the 'no footsies' contract you signed.
18,0,0,Right-wing politics
18,0,0,Trump says it's straight--so let's go with it.
17,0,0,"OK team, this is how we leverage the buyout."
18,1,0,"Or, we could just Skype."
20,4,1,This meeting of the Cruise Line Shipping Association is now called to order.
18,1,1,"From where I sit, it's all downside."
18,3,0,Just whose idea was it to have this conference on a cruise ship?
18,0,0,Our competitors can do whatever they want; but we were founded as a pro-gravity organization.
22,6,6,What's it going to take to bring you all to the table?
17,0,0,This is just one consequence of moving to the far right.
18,2,0,"Refusing to admit that there was a major problem with the new office, he fired the window guy."
17,3,0,"If you think I'm wrong, level with me!"
19,6,3,I want you all to know you can always come to me.
18,0,0,I didn't think the table was stacked that much.
18,0,0,Another reason we all must stick together on architectural inspection day.
18,1,0,"As Chairman of the Board, I'm willing to show you some leniency."
20,3,2,Welcome to Escher Industries.
17,0,0,I know that you all feel that the weight of the world is on your shoulders... that's to bad!
17,3,0,Trust is a difficult thing to learn.
17,1,0,I know we've had our ups and downs.
22,7,5,"Before we begin, I'd just like to point out that Mr. Gehry was very highly recommended."
18,0,0,Ha! The table has turned.
18,0,0,"It is hard to believe, but you're really fired."
19,4,1,"OK, I'm gonna start by being level with you..."
19,9,2,All in favor of suing the architect...
18,0,0,See - saw you plotting against me!
20,0,1,I hope you all don't see me as a bit one sided!
18,5,0,It's not contagious.
21,2,2,"According to Mr. Gehry's legal team, we simply aren't understanding the concept of the building as visualized by Mr. Gehry."
19,6,0,"Well, welcome to my first cabinet meeting. I hope everyone is comfortable with my election."
19,4,2,Welcome to your first Weight Watchers meeting!
18,1,0,"I'm reading a book on management, and I've learned a new tip."
18,3,0,"Don't worry, I'm fine."
18,2,0,I'm proud to announce that business is on the upswing!
17,1,0,I'm glad we're able to see things from a new perspective.
18,1,0,"I can understand a drift to the right, or even the left, but this is beyond me."
18,0,0,So you're all leveling with me by saying you want a raise?
21,3,2,I promise I'll stop ordering liver and onions during lunch meetings.
18,1,0,We have to get a better ping pong table!
19,8,2,It is still the view of the board that the ship is not sinking.
17,3,0,Your opinions weigh heavily on this room.
19,4,0,"oh, well...that's because you voted in favor of rocking the boat"
21,2,2,I'd like to elicit feedback on Phase One of our restructuring.
18,2,0,The window reflects our quarterly report - delusional.
17,2,0,"Now that you've mastered slant, let's talk about spin."
20,6,2,"And that my friends, is how babies are made..."
19,7,0,Let's not make this all about me
18,5,0,First item on the agenda: switch to stationary chairs
18,0,0,What's that about a level playing field?
19,3,0,Let's start by rearranging the desk chairs.
17,2,0,Can you pinpoint when these feelings of inferiority first began?
17,2,0,You guys just can't sit still.
19,1,1,I'm glad to see that you are all together on this proposal
18,0,0,"I went overboard with the synergy stuff, didn't I."
17,1,0,"Sorry, I know you're upset, but I DID call same seats."
18,4,0,We need to approach this from a different angle.
17,3,0,I had hoped you wouldn't notice my fart.
18,1,0,I thought it was a group talk.
18,1,1,I guess we now know which one of us got the chair with the broken casters.
19,5,1,You guys should probably move...I can only hold this table for so much longer.
18,5,0,We need someone to fix our window.
18,0,0,"This meeting of the Mystery Spot board of directors is called to order,"
18,1,0,"No doubt you're all familiar with the term ""level playing field""?"
20,5,1,I understand your position. But that's just not the way I roll.
17,2,0,"We need to fix this. The most popular idea is to install seatbelts. All in favor, say aye!!"
19,3,0,"Each of you have feelings and opinions that are important to me, but I've asked you here to shut up and listen."
21,8,4,So its unanimous?
19,5,1,I think you all understand the gravity of the situation.
18,2,0,In case you didn't get the memo the company is going downhill.
19,7,0,"We've got to get the company back on an even keel, guys."
19,3,0,Any questions?
18,1,1,Carl was always talking down to his colleagues.
18,5,0,"I haven't decided yet, but I'm leaning in your direction."
21,2,4,I'm sure you appreciate the gravity of the situation.
18,0,0,Haven't we met someplace before?
18,0,0,"Yes, I do run ten miles from my house to the office every morning. Why do you ask?"
18,2,0,"...this table is not fair and square , but it is helpful in keeping you at arms length ."
18,3,0,"We're getting chairs without wheels next week, I promise."
17,1,0,Brexit negotiations: I still want marital privileges but I don't want to support you financially and reserve the right to see other people.
20,4,1,What do you mean that I am oblivious to the gravity of the situation?
20,4,1,Let’s all agree that the foundation of this company isn’t strong.
22,2,4,You've made it obvious which way the board is leaning.
20,3,2,It's not too late to change your vote.
17,0,0,I feel something is askew. Your thought would be appreciated.
18,0,0,Let's put all our cards on the table regarding the new contract.
18,3,0,Our first team-building exercise is to give everyone a seat at the table.
21,3,2,Did anyone else feel that quake?
19,1,0,"Yes, the ship is sinking."
18,3,0,Which one of you complained about a glass ceiling?
18,1,0,"Trust me, this new seating plan guarantees synergy efficiency."
17,1,0,I called this meeting together to talk about the downturn in our economy.
18,3,0,I did not realize that our business management team was so lopsided.
18,0,0,NOW we're in sync.
20,5,1,"Yes, the rumors are true. We've pivoted."
19,1,1,I need each and every one of you to understand the gravity of our current situation.
18,0,0,I want to know if my suggestions can gain positive momentum.
18,6,0,"Obviously, you do not grasp the gravity of the situation."
18,1,1,I am tabling the motion.
21,6,3,"It will cost too much to straighten the building, so we are just going to take the wheels off the chairs."
18,1,0,Got ethanol?
18,0,0,"Meetings are a challenge at ""Mystery Spot"" Inc."
19,5,0,Any questions about corporate structure?
20,2,1,I know it seems the weight of evidence is against me.
17,1,0,"Well, I can never accuse you of being listless."
21,2,2,Of COURSE you can have a seat at the table - just not at MY table.
22,3,4,All I said was Trump is not that bad.
18,1,0,"You can see for yourself, the new ""Heel Gripper"" really works."
19,0,1,"""REALLY"" , Not one of you has heard of , "" Beer Pong "" ?"
22,8,6,"It can't be that bad, the band's still playing."
18,3,0,We need a new slant on things
17,1,0,Perhaps a larger SmartBoard would help level the playing field.
18,2,0,You're probably all wondering why I've gathered you there today.
19,4,0,Today we will discuss physical and psychological illusions.
18,8,0,I don't mean to talk down to you...
20,3,1,Salaries will be determined by a sliding scale.
19,6,0,What do you mean I'm not being level with you?
19,1,1,"I can see this is a ""right leaning group"", but lets try and keep an open mind."
18,0,0,See? It's not that hard to find a consensus.
17,3,0,Is it my imagination that you all seem to be leaning toward taking early retirement?
18,0,0,"I assure you all, there is no problem with my platform."
20,2,2,"I repeat, rumours about this company being a 'sinking ship' are completely false."
20,4,1,"OK team, it's time to level the playing field."
19,4,1,I don't think you appreciate the gravity of the situation.
17,3,0,I know you are all going to take a conservative position on this matter.
18,0,0,When we team build we include everyone...Even the tyrant from HR.
21,3,3,Thank you for coming. I hope you're all comfortable. Can everyone see the screen?
18,1,0,"I thought we were friends. All I said was ""it's impetigo"""
19,6,0,I think it's time we start talking about delisting.
18,2,0,Your opinions carry a great deal of weight.
19,3,1,You might have the numbers but maybe I let go of the desk.
21,8,1,"In San Francisco, we like to proceed as if nothing's happened."
18,0,0,"All in favor say ""Aye""."
18,0,0,So I drew the short stick!!! Get over it!!!!
18,3,0,You want to level the playing field? Marry the CEO's daughter.
20,4,0,I'm beginning to think something's crooked in this organization.
17,1,0,Did anyone Vote Leave?
19,0,0,"Hi Bill. Yes, we're all here for the conference call."
19,5,0,I think you all appreciate the gravity of our situation. Now what?
19,5,1,I think we should look at this new project from a different angle.
18,2,0,What do you mean you want to level the playing field?
17,1,0,Always use the home field advantage.
18,3,0,"I'll bet not one single one of you remembers what ""a slide rule"" was, do you?"
18,3,0,"Alright, so we endorse Trump."
20,2,1,I think we need a new angle.
19,5,1,I take it the board has changed its position
18,3,0,Now that you know what our bottom line feels like let's get back to work.
18,0,0,"As I was saying, our company is on a roll and our product is rockin'"
19,6,0,Can we get a little levity in here?
18,1,0,"And under my leadership, we *will* right this ship."
20,3,1,"""This is a sliding scale workplace""."
21,1,2,"no, it's not a level playing field. It's a slippery slope."
20,3,2,"In hindsight, we should not have invested in the chairs with wheels."
18,1,1,I have a new angle on the problem.
19,1,1,I see you have a rudimentary grasp of the trickle down theory. Let's get into more nuanced details.
18,1,0,Down and to the right is not where our company should be headed.
19,3,3,Welcome to the Trump School of Interior Architecture.
20,2,1,We've become a right-leaning organization.
20,2,1,I thought all of you wanted a seat at the table!
20,4,1,"Is it me, or is Trump Tower is leaning right too?"
19,0,1,"If I didn't have this table here,I'd be in your lap."
18,1,0,This is a new game called table tenants.
19,3,0,We are now entering a new era of participatory management: the old days of us versus them are over.
17,0,0,Wait. You all weren't hoping Ramsay Bolton won?
18,1,1,"Now, let's address the issue of unequal pay."
19,0,1,"It's our new top-down management style, even in how we sit."
18,1,0,There's got to beee a boardroom after.
19,7,1,"Planning and preparedness. See, I had the foresight to lock my wheels in case of a sudden shift in perspective."
17,1,0,I thought this magazine slanted to the left!
18,2,0,"Of course your opinions matter, I always want my management and employees to have a level playing field."
17,1,0,Welcome to Anal-Retentives Anonymous. You may come forward. There's nothing wrong with a crooked whiteboard.
18,0,0,We here at Leaning tower of Pisa inc need to completely rethink our business model.
20,3,1,You look hostile!
21,2,3,"All those in favor of removing their wheels, say ""Aye""."
17,0,0,..for a successful summer remember these two things: you are either on top or you are not; the names of the custodial staff...
18,2,0,"It's not true, I promise! I'd never vote for Trump."
18,0,0,"Hi everybody, thanks for comi.... Margaret, please stop playing footsies with SL486, you know he's not programmed for that."
17,1,0,There has been a shift in our marketplace.
18,1,0,We had a choice: cheap rent or pink slips.
18,3,0,We've reconsidered the corporate ladder.
20,3,1,I thought this was a level playing field.
19,6,1,"I don't know how, but I'm trying to level with you."
20,4,1,I'm comfortable with the balance of power in this company.
20,4,1,So you think my argument is slanted one way?
20,3,1,I find this distracts people from the fact that I'm 9 inches tall.
18,1,0,"And, finally, a special thanks to Lyle for his very special perspective."
19,4,1,There was just enough room in the budget to straighten the window.
19,1,1,"Then it's unanimous, this vote will rock the boat"
18,2,0,"As you can tell, we're in the middle of restructuring."
19,1,1,"""Does anyone know a good meeting planner?'"
17,0,0,The last thing this company needs is a level playing field.
20,5,2,"If you want a seat at the table, you're going to have to Lean In"
19,3,1,"Am I safe in assuming that, from your perspective, things are starting to look up?"
19,1,1,Sorry guys. I shouldn't have had that bean burrito for lunch.
17,0,0,"OK, everyone in favor of the new fitness center, say aye."
19,1,1,I just felt that it was time for a new angle.
17,3,0,How many times do I have to tell you... Bankruptcy isn't contagious
18,1,0,Welcome to my architecture master class!
17,8,0,Welcome to California.
18,0,0,"Okay, now I understand all about the decline of the middle class. You're still not getting a raise."
19,3,1,"Really, people. This is just an optical illusion."
18,3,0,I believe the evidence is slanted in your favor.
23,0,2,"That's the way we roll at ""Tilt"" magazine."
19,3,1,"Are we just ballast? Get the lead out, people."
21,2,2,"You, there, on my right, what's so damned funny?"
21,2,1,"Everyone remain calm, Peggy knocked over the doll house again. ""Peggy The Pretty Princess"" will still be on Forbes top list for the year."
19,4,1,"Well, I can see you all appreciate the gravity of the situation."
16,0,0,"As you can see, risks to the firm remain tilted to the downside."
18,1,0,"Again, it was one of the tiniest summer eisberg."
18,0,0,We try not to slant things toward Wall Street and the stockholders.
17,2,0,"As you'll soon see, the consultants are recommending a new slant on the business."
20,2,2,You're probably all wondering why I sceduled this meeting in Pisa.
20,2,2,"It was a rough quarter, but we remain long-term focused here at Titanic Enterprises"
17,2,0,I'm inclined to agree that there are seismic paradigm shifts happening in our business.
19,3,1,I don't think everybody in this room appreciates the gravity of our situation.
19,4,2,I hope you all appreciate the gravity of this situation.
18,1,0,Hanson. I expect you to belay the message to management.
21,6,3,I would like to address the rumors of instability in this company.
19,1,1,We have to expect these swings in the business cycle.
19,3,1,I see you're all feeling the gravity of our situation.
17,1,0,"Sorry. When the market slides, so do you."
16,0,0,No need to tell you that its an uphill battle to enter management!
18,1,0,This is not a conference table. It's a manifestation of how I'm going to table your dumb ideas.
19,0,1,"Yep, Bobbies, it's all downhill now."
18,1,0,Did I mention that this was a location shoot for China Town?
19,4,1,All in favor of manning the life boats?
18,3,0,And next Monday we'll meet to discuss getting chairs without wheels.
17,3,0,"All in favor of removing the casters from the chairs, say ""Aye!"""
17,0,0,That's why it's called the Off Kilter Motivational Room. Now roll yourselves back up here.
18,1,0,"I'm surprised at you, Carla."
16,0,0,Start thinking about asymmetrical competition.
19,1,1,"Before whining about fairness, did you consider that maybe the picture is crooked?"
19,6,1,And we save 10% of our health insurance costs by making the walk to the copy machine uphill.
18,3,0,The weight of my salary package will balance this company.
18,8,1,I'm inclined to let it slide.
19,4,1,"I think, then, we can dispense with the graph."
19,3,1,"If there is any dissent, I will let go of this table."
17,2,0,I'm open to suggestions on why Ace Architects just can't close a deal.
18,0,0,Now get out there and do what you can to tilt the playing field back in our favor.
21,2,2,"Thank you for attending the final meeting of the Titanic Safety Committee. George, explain your suggestion about installing life preservers in meeting rooms."
17,2,0,Its my gas I get it. Nobody could pretend it was just because of the earthquake.
18,1,0,"I assure you, your chairs will not be the only thing rolling downhill."
18,0,1,We've combined scalability and leverage. Questions?
19,5,2,Relocating corporate headquarters to international waters may take some getting used to.
18,3,0,"I'm not contagious, I swear!"
19,4,1,Corporate has made it clear which way they are leaning...
20,6,2,I'm sure you all realize the gravity of the situation.
20,4,2,I was hired to bring balance to the company.
20,7,3,Lunch should be here shortly. I ordered sliders.
21,2,1,"While I'm not one to say, 'I told you so,' I must remind you of my warning that we were starting down a slippery slope."
20,2,1,"Unfortunately, Brexit has trigged a precipitous decline for our business."
22,6,4,We have to stop meeting like this.
20,4,1,You people are going to be surprised by the new slant I have on the issue.
18,3,0,The Board of the Museum of Modern Art is now adjourned.
18,3,0,I think this shows us what the problem was in the elevator this morning.
18,0,0,"As I told you, every issue on the table was titled against you. The Corporation Wins!"
20,8,2,And we can begin the meeting as soon as SOMEONE starts holding the magazine straight.
17,1,0,Perhaps introducing a new slant on meetings to improve office moral has been taken too far
20,4,2,"Yes, you're right, this company is facing an uphill battle."
18,1,0,"AS NEW MEMBERS OF THIS BOARD, YOU MUST LEARN HOW TO LOCK YOUR CHAIR WHEELS."
19,4,1,None of you seem to be aware of the gravity of this situation.
18,0,0,I think item #1 on the agenda should be the recent sinkhole problem we've recently experienced.
19,1,1,I don't think we have a right-wing slant but we must address the issue of appearances.
19,5,1,"Yes, I’m the architect. What seems to be the problem?"
19,1,1,Am I the only VP choice?
18,1,0,We've got a new slant on conferences.
21,3,2,I'll make this candid and short. Our company is a sinking ship.
18,3,0,I'm inclined to reject the proposal.
18,1,1,"And now, I trust, you can all see my angle."
17,1,0,"First, I really appreciate everyone gathering together on such short notice."
19,4,1,I knew this Board was crooked.
18,0,1,"Quickly, I need three of you to move your chairs behind me."
19,17,4,We're here today to discuss firing the architect.
19,1,1,I know I've taken you by surprise.
18,1,0,My great grandfather represented survivors of the Titanic.
21,3,2,I sense a slight shift.
18,2,0,And next week's team building exercise will be a juice cleanse.
15,1,1,It's just so you remember that I'm chairman of the board.
21,1,4,I think now would be a good time to show our recent sales graph!
18,3,0,'We need to convince the public that our hedge fund is on the level.'
18,0,0,"Sure, that was a really big one. But was it as big as a fully synergized network of thought leaders?"
20,8,2,My cartoonist has been drinking again
20,1,0,"Due to budget cuts, you are all being let go. I, however, will be getting a promotion as well as a new office."
18,2,1,Welcome to the Titanic Boardroom where our motto is Never Let Go
18,3,0,"An an equal opportunity employer, we try to create a work environment that provides a level playing field for all of our employees."
19,1,1,"The Extraterrestrial Union welcomes you, with free trade across the galaxy and a painless exit policy."
21,2,2,"Things are definitely looking up, here at Teeter Totter Inc."
18,3,0,That's certainly a lopsided vote.
18,1,0,Anyone else cares to agree with her?
20,2,1,You are probably all wondering why I've gathered you together today...
19,1,1,We are not here to discuss a Level Playing field
21,4,3,"I'll count to 3, and then I let go of the table."
18,3,0,"That was an interesting slant on the situation, Johnson."
20,5,1,"Before I let go of this table, I want you all to know how much I have appreciated working with you."
18,4,1,Who put this to a floor vote?
18,2,0,"So, what you are telling me is that we need to right this ship."
18,0,0,Jim finally realized just how bad his breath was.
18,1,0,Now what now that they backed us into a corner?
18,3,0,I'm confident we'll be up next quarter
22,3,4,"Welcome, National Council on Astigmatism."
18,0,0,I'm LEANING towards selling the company and putting everyone out of a job. Get it? LEANING?
17,7,1,"In fact, I'm sure it was the onions."
20,2,2,I can't emphasize enough the gravity of our situation.
21,3,2,I seem to be the only that understands the gravity of the situation.
17,0,0,Good luck to all applicants; but beware your chances are weighted against you
17,2,0,Wait till you see the optical illusion bathrooms!
17,1,0,If one is backed into the corner we're all backed into the corner - ready or not here I come!
17,0,0,"If we were on the Titanic, you all would be dead."
18,3,0,"Despite your misgivings, this is a titanic opportunity."
17,1,0,See things from my perspectuve
18,1,0,I sense the Board's vote has been weighted against me...
19,3,0,Am I the only one who sees the gravity of our situation?
18,5,0,"Janet, reach out to Purchasing and find out who the hell ordered casters."
19,6,0,"Yes, it's true. I'm not being level with you."
17,0,0,So our plan to move corporate HQ offshore has had some unexpected drawbacks...
17,2,0,It's the screen that's askew. Not to worry.
20,4,1,Skewed in my favor!? I resent the implication!
21,5,3,I see my opinion doesn't carry much weight.
18,2,1,The meeting of the OCD club will now come to order.
18,1,0,"Bottom line is we're going need all hands on deck this quarter, it's time to right the ship"
18,2,0,Gentlemen. I am afraid that our stock is in a titanic slide downward.
20,3,1,"Show of hands: Who's read ""Lean In?"""
19,4,1,Does anybody have any questions?
19,2,1,This is what 51% really means.
18,0,0,Yes in my opinion it does roll downhill
18,1,0,This focus group is about self-esteem.
18,0,0,I learned how to be a leader from Mr Trump. My brain is better than yours so listen to me. I speak for the people.
19,3,0,"No, I've never needed a level playing field in order to succeed. Next question?"
17,0,0,The Disorientation Presentation for new employees
19,5,0,Looks like things are tilting in your favor.
18,1,1,The needs of the many outweighs the needs of the CEO
18,3,0,Anybody else have a different slant on it?
17,2,0,"First, let me thank you for volunteering to serve on Acme Shipping Lines board of directors."
18,3,0,Your editorial policy is definitely slanted.
21,2,3,"Of course there are drawbacks, but this is the most affordable office space in all of Pisa."
18,2,0,Pitch me.
18,0,0,I'm afaid you were all vetted for Trump's Vice President.
17,0,0,"Under my leadership, I do plan to level the playing field for all investors."
18,2,0,Your probe went well... we'll see you in six months for your follow-up.
18,1,1,"Well, this is a new slant to board meetings."
19,0,1,"Who says our ""annual sales at sea"" meeting isn't a great idea?"
19,0,1,Was it everything I said?
18,1,0,"Okay you've made your point, converting the old circus fun house into new office space was a bad idea"
20,6,0,"Sorry, the rumors are true--we're downsliding."
18,4,0,"I assure you, it will 'trickle down' to you ar some point,"
18,1,0,I see the balance of power has shifted.
19,6,2,Are you with me so far?
18,2,0,The Board has weighed your proposal.
18,1,0,Your right leanings are swaying the floor.
18,1,0,Our diversity policy is a success: we've leveled the playing field.
18,5,0,It’ll sort itself out once we’ve rounded Cape Horn
17,1,0,With your permission I'd like to table the subject of bonuses until our next meeting.
19,3,0,Anybody know a good plumber?
18,1,1,I can see that achieving consensus will be an uphill battle...
19,6,0,Our first order of business is to remove the wheels from our chair legs.
20,4,1,My position is clear....
19,0,1,Here's my slant on the deal!
18,1,0,Our financial direction for the last quarter is down
20,3,2,That's it! No more cruise line retreats.
18,6,0,"Jones, have the wheels removed from conference room chairs until we dock. And straighten the bulletin board."
18,0,0,You do this every time it's my turn to pick lunch.
17,0,0,(shouted from the crowd) GESUNDHEIT!
18,3,0,We're meeting here today to address concerns about changes in this company's perspective.
20,3,1,I think your decision is lopsided
17,1,0,The RNC Seating layout.
16,5,0,Perhaps I have underestimated the gravity of the situation.
19,0,0,"So, what are you thinking?"
19,6,1,"As you may have guessed, our stock is down."
18,0,0,"Effective immediately, our policy of free staff lunches is being discontinued."
18,2,0,"We've brought you in because after all our surveys, you're the only bloody 7 voters who know why they voted for Brexit!..."
18,1,0,Of course the buck stops here.
19,1,1,So...a show of hands...how many think we need to level the playing field?
17,1,0,Everybody laughed when I suggested emergency brakes for our chairs. Look at us now.
18,1,0,"Like I said, only my Preferred Shares come with voting authority."
19,1,1,tHE ENTIRE BOARD OF EDITORS OF THE NY TIMES WELCOMES YOU TO OUR QUADRENNIAL PRO-ISRAEL LUNCHEON AND ROUND-TABLE.
17,1,0,"Well, yes...we have tilted our resources toward upper management"
19,4,0,"once I find out who is responsible for this new board room design, heads will roll !"
20,5,1,"We're facing an uphill battle and unfortunately, some of you may not make it."
18,1,1,"Look guys, I shouldn't have to throw my weight around all the time."
18,3,0,"As I was saying, it flows downhill."
20,4,1,Let's look at it from a different angle.
18,3,0,Have we really looked at every angle?
19,4,1,I sense that you all have shifted your position on this matter.
19,10,1,"Okay, who hired the architect?"
20,3,2,Try looking at it from my point of view
18,3,0,"Admittedly, this is what I had in mind when I told the architect ""Innovative"""
20,3,1,Unfortunately our foundation is teetering on the brink of extinction
19,1,1,"Please, you guys, that is nothing like walking the plank."
20,5,2,Our critics say the party leans too far to the right.
21,2,2,"We're at a tipping point, people."
20,4,0,Nothing unusual. The cream always rises to the top.
19,5,2,The issue of Ralph's B.O. finally reached a tipping point..
20,0,1,"""I'd like to thank everyone to this years corporate retreat here in beautiful Pisa Italy."
19,2,0,I thinks it's clear that profits are down.
20,3,1,Next applicant. Mr. Sysiphus?
17,1,0,"As you know, it's been a tipsy-turvy week."
18,2,0,"In this business, you have to play all the angles This is my version of a level playing ground ."
18,2,0,We operate on a level playing field.* * with notably rare exceptions
20,4,1,You may have noticed recently a shift in the balance of power.
18,2,0,I brought you all together to get your slant on the proposed merger.
17,0,0,That's a unanimous nay for the table motion then?
17,0,0,"Now that my little demonstration has your attention, look to the right. I present the future of our company, The Zip Zap H09 Self-Leveling Monitor."
18,7,1,"Don't think of it as me speaking down to you, look at it as you looking up to me."
18,2,0,It's just so it won't crash into you
12,4,0,"""Now the room's feng shui is perfect""."
20,3,1,"You see folks, this is what I was talking about - you're just not strategic thinkers."
18,3,0,I see the odds are weighted against me.
19,0,1,Anyone else care to talk about a level playing field?
21,1,1,Our move to the right has a downside.
21,2,2,"Yes, I have the zika virus--nevertheless, I'm qualified for the job."
19,7,1,This business is quite literally in decline.
19,5,1,Does that painting look crooked to you?
19,5,0,"Really, who wants to go first?"
20,4,2,Welcome to trickle down Econ 101.
19,0,0,"If a liberal view is represented we would only lose 1% of our viewers, but they would all be in THE 1%."
19,3,1,As the Chairman of the board it is my job to put things in perspective.
18,1,1,Anybody got any ideas why sales of our new deodorant soap are so awful?
17,3,0,Surely you can all appreciate my perspective.
19,5,1,So you're the committee that selected the architect for the new headquarters.
18,1,1,The immediate effect of Brexit on our business fundamentals is apparent.
19,7,0,When I said we need to rollback I meant prices!
19,3,1,"If everyone's comfortable, let's begin this meeting."
19,4,2,If our downhill slide continues we will soon be upside down.
18,0,0,That's what I call bottom-up strategy.
18,1,0,I'm not on the level? Poppycock!
18,0,0,Since I've got you all together...
18,1,0,As you can see I am the boss and this is not a level playing field.
19,3,1,"I know what your thinking, but I can assure you I am not part of the 1%"
17,1,0,I was told there would be doughnuts and coffee.
19,0,1,"So, everyone is going to be replaced by human-like robots, and, in fact, I'm not your boss anymore, but one of the prototypes in test. Uncanny isn't it?"
20,5,3,Let me welcome you to Form Over Function Architects LLC.
18,1,0,"Now that I've rolled to my new position as CEO, I think it's time to make some changes."
19,5,0,Now I'm going to level with you folks
18,2,1,I can see which way the room is leaning.
19,8,1,I'm pleased to see that all of you appreciate the gravity of this situation.
20,4,1,Be straight with me. Is my breath really that bad?
19,12,0,Will someone please straighten the picture?
17,2,0,Remember its uphill to get a seat at the table.
20,3,2,Crikey! I forgot the balance sheets!
18,3,1,I've called you all here today to discuss downsizing.
19,0,0,I know my CEO pay defies gravity...but you have to admit it feels appropriate
20,2,3,Our campaign has shifted to the far right.
20,3,0,I guess the board doesn't think much of my new slant on our marketing approach.
21,3,2,I see that a different perspective doesn't change anything.
20,3,1,"As you all can see, our consumer demographic is extremely skewed."
18,1,1,I must concede that opinion has tipped in another direction.
21,2,3,....OK the ayes have it. All future meetings will moved to Florence.
20,3,1,I've concluded that the company is listing in the wrong direction.
19,0,1,The meeting of the campaign advisory committee will begin as soon as someone straightens the window.
19,5,0,"Moving forward, we must hit the ground rolling."
21,4,1,Can someone fix that window?
18,2,0,"First off, I'd like to congratulate you all on making it to the third round of interviews."
20,5,1,"I think if the rest of you take the wheels off your chairs, we can resume the meeting."
17,0,0,And my second official action as CEO is to remind everyone that blame flows downhill.
22,1,2,Im tabling our discussion of gravity
18,0,1,Moved and seconded: Next year we take our working vacation on land.
20,5,2,"Before we begin, can someone straighten the picture please?"
19,7,1,I want to level with you.
18,1,0,"1) Six-timing Gladys, you're my target! 2) See? My chair rollers can be locked!"
19,3,1,We encourage you to lean in.
19,5,1,Thank God for walls.
18,2,0,"Welcome to our new office in Pisa, Italy."
18,2,0,At least we saved money on chair brakes!
18,5,1,I want to impress upon you the gravity of our situation.
18,1,0,Boss wants a group decision ASAP.
19,3,1,Go ahead...Lean in.
19,2,0,I'm King of the hill and it's a beautiful thing.
19,5,0,"I told you, it wasn't me."
16,3,0,"If we level the playing field, our profits would drop."
19,3,1,"If any of you feel we have a problem, there is always the suggestion box."
19,2,1,It's San Andreas's Fault!
21,2,3,"""Someone has to take the higher ground""."
19,4,1,Does that picture look crooked to you?
16,3,0,"Well, I have to say, you’re not laughing now, are you?"
17,1,0,"Guys, it was an ACCIDENT."
22,4,4,I'd like to address the allegations that our reporting leans to the right.
17,0,0,"First, who forgot to slant the TV?"
19,7,0,Once again I regret getting office space in a Frank Gehry building.
19,4,0,Whose idea was it to have this meeting on a cruise ship during hurricane season?
18,3,0,Stop your bellyaching. You should be glad I didn't order coffee for this meeting!
18,2,0,Failure to lean in.
19,5,0,"As always, I will be completely straight with you."
18,2,0,"OK, then all those for Hillary, what say you?"
18,0,0,We are experiencing a seismic shift in the balance of power.
19,0,0,It seems you have all sided against me and I will have to table the motion.
18,2,0,On a sliding scale from one to ten how would you rate this experince?
18,1,0,"No, I can hear you better like this."
19,0,1,You all clearly lack proper perspective.
18,2,0,"First item of business, when I asked for this meeting to be put on a list ...."
20,4,1,"We need bold new ideas! Remember how this company was founded: by my grandfather, over a sinkhole."
18,3,0,It's just an optical illusion. Or is it?
20,6,3,"As luck would have it, our next agenda item is a report from Building Maintenance."
20,0,1,Mr Trump has assured me that this building is fantastic and your disgusting chairs are rolling to be politically correct.
20,1,2,I've decided this week's best salesperson will be chosen on a sliding scale.
18,1,0,We couldn't afford a Union contractor.
17,0,0,"Listen, I'm a Brit, we used to have an Empire."
18,1,0,"Focus, Gro, Up."
21,2,1,I understand you have some questions about the company's 30-degree policy.
18,2,0,"Hey, folks! Thanks for coming to the Earthquake Recovery meeting."
20,2,1,It's time I leveled with you.
19,0,1,Think about it - there are no mortgages in space!
19,6,1,"I'm sorry, but now that the bank has placed a lean on the building, I have no choice but to let all of you go."
17,0,0,This meeting will now come to odor.
18,3,0,"So, what's your tilt to our new ad campaign?"
17,2,0,Majority literally tilts the room.
17,3,0,"Now you all are looking up to me, we can proceed."
21,3,2,"I said..., this discussion appears a bit lopsided."
17,0,0,"Ooh, I can see Chapter 11 from up here!"
18,3,0,"It may come as a surprise, but business is down."
17,0,0,Can anyone tell me why this conference room is called 'The Titanic?'
18,0,0,"Okay, so who's the one who keeps tilting the damn picture?"
21,2,2,One of you is going out that window until we figure this out
18,2,0,Abandon hope - for a level playing field - all ye who enter here.
17,1,0,Nobody likes an empty picture frame
22,3,1,Our client wants us to find research that points out the myth of global tilting.
18,2,0,"Yes, I understand it's an issue that's weighing heavy on everyone's mind. Bottom line: Approximately how high would this wall need to be to keep both Donald AND Hillary out?"
18,2,0,Now THIS week we need a new slant on our work METAPHORICALLY.
18,3,0,Sorry I can't provide a level playing field.
20,2,3,A guy who had something to do with that Fred Astaire movie is coming in to help.
21,3,2,I favor the motion.
18,1,0,Either the painting's off-white or our company is.
18,2,1,I still say we stay calm and rearrange the deck chairs.
18,0,0,Our decline is off the chart.
18,5,0,"Now, isn't this more clear than an org chart?"

19,4,1,Maybe the cruise ship offsite was a bad idea.
17,3,0,That's perfect - I finally have cell reception!
18,1,0,So I've been hearing some clamoring for a raise.
18,0,0,Some of you will have to sit at this end.
20,4,1,I would like to level with you.
20,3,3,Salaries will be based on a sliding scale. Determined by me.
23,9,7,The captain assures me it was a very small iceberg.
19,1,1,We grade on a sliding scale.
19,8,2,So now let us adjourn to the life boats.
20,5,1,You don't appreciate the gravity of the situation.
19,1,1,The agenda is now off the table.
17,3,0,Have I impressed on you what it's like being on a sinking ship?
19,0,1,Remember: expectation plus perception equals a slanted view.
22,6,3,New business: I propose we get rid of these wheely chairs.
18,3,0,I suppose you're wondering what this all about....
18,0,0,"Members of the office space committee, you're fired!"
17,3,0,So much for the level playing field idea.
19,5,2,Didn't anyone think to ask if the cartoonist could handle perspective?
19,6,2,"Like the job description said, we're looking for a candidate who is upwardly mobile."
18,6,1,You wanna work remotely? You got it!
18,2,0,"The playing field, perhaps. But not the board room!"
19,2,0,Remind me who's idea it was to book our corporate retreat on the Titanic.
21,3,2,Can somebody straighten that picture frame?
19,4,1,My position gives me a unique perspective.
18,0,0,Our profits are sliding....as is the building.
17,0,0,Are you going to believe your own eyes or the whiteboard.
19,4,0,"All those in favor of reinstating the building code, say aye."
18,1,0,I've decided to table all of your motions!
17,4,0,"Actually, I have the upper hand"
17,2,0,I think the new painting really livens the room up.
18,3,0,"I’ll remind the room that the proper term is “Supply Side Ergonomics""."
17,0,1,"""Was the tipping point when I said The New Yorker was for prep school pedants?"
23,12,7,I am entertaining a motion to evacuate. Do I hear a second?
19,4,1,I want you all to level with me.
18,2,0,You're right. Black does make you look heavier.
17,3,0,Let's all consider the downside for a moment.
19,6,0,I feel your support slip sliding away.
17,0,0,"I KNOW , BUT LET'S DISCUSS IT FIRST...."
19,1,1,We must not be deterred by the optics of a crooked whiteboard.
19,2,1,Could someone please straighten that dang painting!
17,3,0,"You may disagree, but from my perspective we're really going downhill."
19,7,0,It's called 'disruptive architecture'.
18,2,0,I think we can all agree that it's in everybody's best interest that some members should reconsider their position.
18,6,1,"Oh, sure, you all SAY you want a seat at the table . . ."
19,5,2,I'm sorry. The board has asked us to be more transparent with our salary disparity.
19,1,1,"O.K., then, we're all agreed: replacing this table with a round one would not make everyone feel more equal."
20,5,2,"Do you wish to table that motion, or let it slide?"
19,4,0,"I just want you to know, working here, you will not be climbing the typical corporate ladder."
19,6,0,"I don't disagree that scheduling this meeting on a ship was, in hindsight, a bad idea."
18,1,0,We won't stand for inequality.
18,2,0,Today our magazine will begin to print articles exclusively in italics.
18,2,0,I now call this meeting of the Pisa Foundation to order.
18,0,0,Who's up for a pie fight?
18,1,0,"No, you're just being nice. I'll go find a breath mint."
18,2,0,"You seem to have the weight of evidence on your side, but . . .."
18,3,0,This is what happens when you let things slide.
18,1,0,"NOW you see what I mean when I say, ""Don't rock the boat!"""
18,0,0,"This is MY seat, Perkins -- no matter how early you get to the meeting."
18,1,0,"Come on, I was only out one day."
18,3,0,Welcome to the Vertigo Support Group.
19,4,1,"'Aye,' 1. ""Nay,"" seven. The ""Aye"" has it."
17,2,0,"The era of ""lean in"" is over."
18,1,0,OK. So there may be some truth to the rumor about our recent stock slide.
17,0,0,I tell you. That man is on the rise.
23,3,5,Company benefits will be given on a sliding scale.
20,5,1,Not just our stock is sliding
19,5,1,C'mon guys. Do we have to do this every time I need a volunteer?
17,3,0,"While the slant I have brought to the table might appear a bit extreme, I never intended for it to put your backs to the wall."
18,2,0,Welcome to Titanic Corp's annual meeting
17,3,0,"Unfortunately, the executive board goes down with the ship."
23,1,6,We have to stop having our board meetings on cruise lines.
21,2,2,i'm here to confirm that it indeed flows downhill
18,1,0,"Why, with the odds tilted slightly in my favor, I do believe that motion passes!"
18,1,0,Does anyone have some WD-40?
17,0,0,This used to be a lair in the old Batman TV series. Isn't it cool!
20,8,3,"So exactly how long have things been going downhill?"""
19,7,1,The architect did mention that there was a minor glitch in the plans...
18,0,0,"So, as I was saying, perhaps we ALL might benefit from some political compromise..."
22,6,3,It's obvious this company is in a steep decline.
19,1,0,I called this meeting to frankly discuss our firm's financial instability.
20,2,2,"First, I'd like to welcome you all to Pisa, Inc."
19,5,0,I believe in being upfront about the uneven playing field.
18,3,0,Shall we check that balance sheet again?
17,0,0,"So, our trip to Liberia was successful."
17,0,0,I believe now is the appropriate time for new leadership.
21,3,3,Believe me when I tell you that your opinion matters just as much as mine.
18,1,0,Welcome to the Teeter Totter building. I'm your host. You may want to hold on.
20,2,2,Leaning in is so last year.
20,4,2,Our motto here is to be fair and balanced!
18,1,0,The next wave will have you all on my side again.
18,3,0,First let me assure you that your pay won't be on a sliding scale.
18,1,0,"John, could you stop proposing motions?"
19,3,1,It seems the axis of opinion has shifted.
18,2,0,"Grumble all you want, condescension rules."
20,2,1,This meeting's rigged.
17,1,0,"I strongly disagree that this reorganization is simply ""changing chairs on the Titanic."""
22,6,4,I'm beginning to see the gravity of the situation.
18,3,0,Not a level playing field!
19,0,0,Victor's struggles with a work-life balance had become increasingly difficult.
18,2,0,Welcome. You may be wondering why we located our offices in the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
18,0,0,For this pitch to work I need three of you to come over and achieve a balance. I love talking in nuance and ambiguity
18,2,0,"Well, my slant on it is that only the CEO should have locks on his Airon."
20,2,1,We need to meet in the middle.
19,4,1,"At first I thought the consensus was skewed, but now I'm inclined to join you."
17,0,0,"Now, can anyone tell me why this conference room is deficated to Isaac Newton?"
18,3,0,"Okay people, we are always being accused of our slanted view. Can someone tell me where this comes from? My view is fine!"
19,1,0,Does anyone have any ideas how to deal with the recession?
18,5,0,So you want to talk about inequality today?
20,5,1,"The bad news is the the tide has turned.""... The good news is Surf's Up."
21,1,2,All I said was maybe Trump wouldn't be the worst candidate in history.
18,6,1,Some of you will think the floor here is not level; some of you will think it is. But what's important is that we respect each others opinion.
18,0,0,We must take strides to do our level best.
18,1,0,We're taking a new slant on this business idea
19,0,1,I've gathered you all here today to feel inferior to me.
18,1,0,"No, Fintabarba, no bathroom break. Another six hours like this, and we'll have Marina Abramovic beat."
18,1,0,I object--tabling the question always leads to the same result.
20,3,2,You're probably wondering why I called you all there.
21,2,1,"Benvenuti, membri del consiglio turismo Comune di Pisa!"
20,3,1,I'm flattered by how much you all look up to me.
17,0,0,My Mother Teresa is a bit concerned that you may not be good enough for me.
20,2,1,All negotiations are off the table.
18,0,0,"As the sole contractor for our own corporate headquarters, I need Legal to look into the contingencies of Rush Construction suing ourselves."
17,3,0,My argument seems to carry a lot of weight
20,3,2,Seating by pay scale.
20,4,1,At least it's not a full downturn.
18,6,0,I get the sense that many of you are leaning in the same direction on this.
19,2,1,"Honestly, I don't know why you think this meeting is weighted in my favor."
17,2,0,"OK, trainees, today's exercise is titled 'Competing And Winning On An Uneven Playing Field.'"
17,0,0,In regard to this year's profits...
20,4,1,How do you all like my power office?
18,1,1,Try leaning in.
19,1,1,"According to our accountant, we're about to go under."
20,4,1,"Come to think of it, I guess it is a slanted argument."
25,7,10,Welcome to Weight Watchers!
16,2,0,"Generally, I prefer not to talk down to a board, but in your case I'll make an exception."
18,3,0,"Ok, I feel like this meeting is getting away from me."
19,6,1,Agreed. Next year's conference will move from Pisa to the Tower of London.
15,1,1,This is what I meant when I said our work force was unbalanced.
20,2,2,A little leverage here!
18,1,0,Thank you for accommodating my germaphobia.
18,1,0,We're trying a new slant on board room meetings...
21,1,2,I'm pleased to get the opportunity to address House Republicans on Climate Change.
18,2,0,I love me a squeaky wheel.
18,2,0,"As your new manager, I want to first dispel a rumor heard that many of think I am a bottom-up idea guy!"
18,3,0,As a right-leaning organization...
20,6,3,Now let me get this straight . . .
19,1,1,Everyone who voted for Brexit-raise your hand. Good-now lets vote again!
18,0,1,OK. You're all on the level with this?
17,3,0,It's a new negotiation strategy.
20,0,2,I don't think you all really appreciate the gravity of situation.
21,2,3,"Well now... the tables seemed to have turned a bit, haven't they?"
17,1,0,I just wanted to put a new slant on things.
18,2,0,Our future as architects are over
19,7,2,"Before we start, can someone straighten that picture?"
17,0,0,What do you mean 'We don't feel we have an equal say in running this Board'? I value all of your opinions.
19,3,1,Which one of you measured the window ?
20,3,1,"Why, yes, I feel I can meet the unique challenges of working here at the Tilt-A-Whirl Corporation."
19,3,1,You're all probably wondering why I've gathered you down there today.
17,3,0,I really think you guys need to level with me.
19,7,1,The property manager said they could straighten up the building but then the window would be crooked.
17,0,0,"And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why my dog ate my homework."
17,0,0,A true leader takes a seat at the table.
21,4,0,I'm a little worried that our portfolio's gotten unbalanced...
17,2,0,"It's called Brexit you idiots, nor Breakfast!"
17,1,0,"Mom and Dad, couldn't you at least pretend to be interested in my takeover remarks?"
18,1,0,"Everyone is really going to have to ""lean in"" on this one."
22,1,3,"With a little time, I'm confident you'll all come my way."
17,3,0,Why do you assume it was me?
17,6,1,I told you the level playing field was a myth!
18,1,1,"See, it's like we're all sitting at the head of the table."
19,2,0,This meeting really got away from me.
18,0,0,"Class, welcome to the history of the 2015 Presidential debates."
18,2,0,"Obviously, the maintenance people installed the wall board incorrectly."
18,1,0,"As you can see, I don't like a level playing field."
19,1,1,"John we don't need to renovate, there is NOTHING wrong with the building."
19,0,1,"Until we have a quorum, I move to table the vote on use of lifeboats."
18,2,0,"So the foreign language aptitude section is done, and between you and me, it's all downhill from here!"""
21,2,2,The Donald has deemed us crooked.
19,1,1,"As you all know, I was never big on the whole 'level playing field' thing."
19,5,0,We'd like to make upward mobility a reality.
21,13,5,Can someone straighten out that picture?
18,4,0,"As I explained to everyone, it's not a level playing field."
17,0,0,"As you can see, our business is not doing a well. As you can see, things are not going well with our business."
17,3,0,I don't think I need to explain the company bias.
19,1,0,My Dad always said it was an uphill roll to the top.
18,0,0,"First, I'd like to thank you for participating in the Fox News ""vote with your wheely-chair"" citizen survey."""
20,2,2,Someone's rocking the boat!
19,6,1,"From now on, it's all uphill."
17,2,0,"All those in favor of righting the ship of state, please step to my rear."
18,0,0,"When I took over as your CEO, I promised to right the ship; but I never dreamed it would be literally."
16,3,0,"As your candidate, I pledge to level the playing field."
17,3,0,It's come to my attention that some of you have your own slant on how I'm running things.
19,0,1,I asked the architect to reflect the volatile economy in our boardroom.
18,5,2,Those in favor of chairs without rollers raise your hand.
18,3,0,All in favor of repealing the law of gravity?
19,0,0,Capatilism.
19,0,1,How do you want your crop circles?
18,3,0,So that's the way you roll here?
18,2,0,I'm here today to address your concerns about a lack of a level playing field within the company.
18,0,1,You've all been downsized.
18,0,0,It only takes a good shove to eliminate your competition.
19,6,0,I told you it was a slippery slope.
18,0,0,"All that vote otherwise, please roll to this side of the room."
19,3,0,I think you'll all agree---that we need to explore different angles.
18,0,0,The architect said this would stimulate discussion.
18,5,0,I want a team that can roll uphill.
18,1,0,This apparent lack of support has not gone unnoticed...
18,1,0,"Now I don't want you to feel that your backs are against the wall, but this Pisa Tower committee has to level the playing field....."
17,3,0,I expect this downturn will be temporary.
17,0,0,Oops that's not right. (Laughs nervously) Don't know how to work this projector! Sorry everyone... (awkward pause) Who puts rolling chairs in a room with all this technology! Ha... am I right? (gulps). Sorry I will straighten this out...
19,4,0,I wonder if they'll let us go home early.
18,1,0,I'll entertain a motion to re-center.
17,1,0,"As executor of your Uncle George's estate, I'm sorry to inform you that debts, taxes and expenses have consumed the entire estate leaving nothing for you as beneficiaries."
19,0,0,My arguments are clearly at a higher level.
18,1,0,So is that plan paradigm-shifting enough?
19,4,1,Thank you for meeting in Pisa.
20,3,3,You're looking at it from the downside.
18,1,0,I assume you've changed your minds?
19,7,2,". . .and for most of you, the road to success will be an uphill battle."
18,2,0,The playing field really IS tilted.
20,2,1,Sometimes offshoring means office on a boat.
18,3,0,"What about ""It's going to be a bumpy ride"" did you guys not understand?"
17,0,0,"All in favor, say aye aye."
18,0,0,Sometimes it pays to be at the head of the table!
17,2,0,You may have noticed that things seem to have gone downhill lately.
20,2,3,I feel the weight of the board is against me.
20,3,1,"Remember, YOU, are our greatest asset at Pisa Incorporated....."
18,1,0,Are you one of the 100's of millions who doesn't suffer from pharmaceutically induced vertigo? Well now there's...
17,2,0,Garlic and onions.
17,0,0,"In this business, you need to scoot yourself up by your own bootstraps."
18,0,0,Do you always have to ask in a tilted GROUP?
18,2,0,"Okay, I'll be brief."
18,0,0,My God - Johnson HAS achieved perfect synergy!
17,0,0,Only the gravity defiant survive in this firm.
17,2,0,Somebody straighten the painting
19,2,0,"You would think that the CEO of a major oral antiseptic company, would know how to use it."
15,1,1,What makes you think the playing field is uneven?
17,1,1,I would like to welcome everyone to our first shareholders meeting in international waters.
21,1,2,Who said this company is slanted in the wrong direction?
22,1,2,"Before we get started, I'd like to first welcome you to the Leaning Tower of Pisa's Conference Center."
19,6,2,"Yes, we pay on a sliding scale."
18,1,0,The password for today is...Ebola
18,0,0,"Sorry to upset you, but..."
17,3,0,Who has some time to head up a sink hole committee?
19,0,0,This ought to give you some incentive to climb our corporate ladder!
20,2,1,This new hydraulic floor adjusts itself based on the current share price.
19,3,0,I did not betray the company.
18,2,0,I think its clear we need level with each other...
20,8,2,I trust you all understand the gravity of the situation.
17,0,0,"From the top down. Can't wait for my edict, right?"
19,1,1,"OK, so I'm biased."
19,5,1,Well I'm glad to see that at least you all can appreciate the gravity of our situation.
18,3,0,Looks like this case is not leaning in your favor.
17,0,0,"We'd like your input on our ""Level the Playing Field"" initiative..."
19,6,2,I've decided that we need to view this business from a new perspective.
19,4,2,Let me level with you.
19,2,1,This group is tipping to the right.
20,3,2,Who seconds the motion for wheelless chairs?
18,1,0,"Ok, it’s unanimous. The motion is tabled."
20,5,2,I don't think you grasp the gravity of this situation.
21,4,0,I want to assure you all how much I value your perspective on our company's operations.
18,1,0,"Ok folks, I'll explain... This is what's known as a HARD to focus group."
18,0,0,"From your perspective, do you think the picture is level...?"
18,0,0,The Zyka virus is not contagious.
19,4,0,We need a new slant.
18,3,1,"As you might have noticed, we have discovered a slight problem in our building design."
19,0,1,Can we at least try to level the playing field?
18,0,1,"Welcome to the ""Leaning Tower of Pisa "" preservation society."
19,0,0,"Anyone who doesn't like our new team name, The Hateful Eight, roll on up here"
18,1,1,We are experiencing a downward trend.
17,1,0,We work on a sliding scale here. Literally.
17,2,0,"All those in favor of more balance in our decisions, move back to the table."
18,3,0,""" I guess you're all wondering why I brought you together like this ."" * this underlined ."
19,1,1,"Despite the Appearance, It is really not me against the other members of the Board!"
20,0,1,Downsizing was inevitable.
17,1,0,"No, we are not going to be working on a level playing field."
18,2,0,We regret that the awkward slant of your gravitational presentation has left us all just slightly confounded.
18,0,0,"We apologize for the misunderstanding, sir. The Board is seeking someone that exerts substantial gravit-as."
19,6,0,Not what I meant by 'Let's have a big rollout'.
20,3,1,Welcome to Seance 101.
19,2,1,can we level with each other
18,1,1,I knew that contractor with the eye patch was all wrong for the job!
23,9,6,"First, I'd like to thank you all for not joining the lawsuit against my brother's architectural firm..."
19,1,1,"On a level playing-field, you wouldn't have your backs to the wall"
19,4,1,Anybody got a mint?
19,5,1,"Alright, then, if there are no objections to the seating arrangements we'll move on to the menu."
21,2,2,Thus concludes the July meeting of the Pisa Co-Op Association.
18,2,0,What colors are your parachutes?
18,3,0,"I appreciate the symbolism, but I really think it's time we got these floors fixed."
21,7,2,I feel like this conversation is one-sided.
17,3,0,I've cancelled the coffee and donut holes for obvious reasons.
18,0,0,In this company you are not just employees but we are all equal stakeholders.
18,1,0,I just wanted to give all of you a tip on our next business opportunity.
17,0,0,Don't let my slanted view back you into a corner.
18,3,0,I thought having our office in an iconic building in Italy would give us some recognition.
17,1,0,Don't believe what you read. This company is unsinkable!
18,2,0,"On behalf of the mayor, I'd like to welcome you to San Francisco."
17,7,0,Perhaps we should look at this from another angle.
17,8,0,"Granted, your argument carries weight."
17,1,0,This was not the business angle I was looking for.
19,0,1,Welcome to bizarro-Pisa
20,1,1,I think our company needs to find a new angle.
18,1,1,The nays have it.
18,3,0,"All those in favor, slide down."
18,2,0,Or we could draw straws.
22,6,3,Raise your hand if you think Frank Gehry is overrated.
20,3,1,Sales are on a roll.
19,6,0,The last architect we hired was let go for obvious reasons.
17,0,0,"As I have just demonstrated, it's not who you are, but where one sits, that counts in our New World Order."""
19,7,1,Now that you understand the gravity of the situation . . .
19,3,1,We've lost all perspective in wha we have been trying to achieve.
20,4,1,My position has shifted.
18,0,0,Open office wasn't working so we've switched to tilted office
20,3,1,Motion to adjourn.
18,0,1,"So, like I said, this is only temporary."
20,5,1,If you want to get onto my management table you're gonna have to push yourselves real hard
20,4,2,We need a different angle.
21,1,2,Feel free to disregard our online cruise survey.
20,5,1,"So, whose idea was this feng shui thing?"
18,2,0,"As you can see, my side is heavier."
20,2,4,Level playing fields are for losers.
18,1,0,"As you can see, your opinions have more weight than mine."
19,1,1,"Okay.... let me explain it again  Your the stockholders But !! I'm the president - that makes me the boss, Get It."
18,2,0,"At the next meeting we'll go to the room where the walls come together, hee, hee, hee ...."
20,2,2,Welcome to our new Pisa branch.
18,7,0,Try to see this from my angle...
17,3,0,You're being downsized.
17,0,0,"Well that takes care of that part of our restructuring, now to tackle the ""mean"" part."
18,2,0,This was the only table the school had for my lecture on efficiency.
18,1,0,as president of the titanic shipping lines i call this meeting to order
19,3,1,"All those in favor of adding casters to the conference table, say ""Aye."""
17,2,0,"So, naturally, I would like your slant on this."
21,3,1,We're being smeared as not fair or balanced by the liberals.
18,0,0,"Due to the raging storm, this ship is sinking. The bad news is, this is going to cause a drop in share holders for our cruise line."
20,2,1,Don't let the windows fool you. We are at sea.
20,1,1,This is how I put baby in the corner.
17,2,0,"You - the Board - are stuck with me. Despite your protest, the odds of me remaining CEO are tilted in my favor."
18,1,0,"Look, we're an insurance agency. I can't cancel this meeting because of a teeny earthquake. Our meeting indemnity clause doesn't cover 'Acts of God'."
20,3,1,Well at least it never rains in Southern California!
18,1,1,It really wasn't my intention to sway the jury.
19,3,1,I'm leaning against.
18,6,1,Clearly I don't favor a level playing field.
21,3,2,Does anyone else want a Dramamine?
19,4,0,Corporate has decided to leave LA.
19,0,0,"Et tu, Brite?"
22,6,5,"Unlike you, I do appreciate the gravity of the situation."
17,1,0,"We're tilting at wingtips here, folks."
17,3,0,"Oh ooo-kay, now I see your point. Perhaps Frank Gehry wasn't the best choice for the new building. My bad."
18,0,0,Introducing Seesaw management style.
19,4,0,Cohesion is essential for teamwork.
19,0,1,"Y'all will have to take the stairs from now on."""
18,0,0,"1,237 delegates makes even the Trump Tower lean to the right."
21,2,2,"Note to Earthquake Committee: ""Take rollers off Boardroom chairs."""
18,0,0,"That's one step forward for a man, seven steps backward for your kind."
18,2,0,Wheeeeeeeee!!!!!
20,4,1,"Yes, just a brief meeting . . .you go first, Sisyphus."
21,2,2,Leveling the playing field will not be as easy as you might think.
17,0,0,"In order to have a good understanding, I feel it is important to give everyone the slant on this project upfront."
24,8,7,"Well, maybe now you will appreciate the gravity of the situation."
17,2,0,Welcome to anti-bias training.
21,2,2,"I agree, I think some leverage is needed here."
17,2,0,Now that I've gathered you all together.
21,3,2,I do hope you all understand the gravity of the situation!
20,5,2,I’ve been letting some things slide recently.
17,1,0,"Before we begin, would someone please straighten up the mirror. Makes me queasy ."
17,3,0,"For those of us sitting at the table, the future at our company looks very bright."
19,4,1,I see you're all tilting one way on this matter.
20,5,1,I wanted to inform you that the structural engineers have discovered a slight problem.
17,0,0,So let's get the ball rolling in the right direction!
17,2,0,"So as you just saw, Cathy was able to catch the roll of quarters. Any other questions on how trickle-down economics works?"
17,2,0,Our ski division reports its equipment testing is proceeding nicely.
17,3,0,Our strategy of vertical AND horizontal integration has really skewed profits.
18,3,0,I'm afraid my skewed perspective limits my ability to see your jobs as anything other than dead weight.
18,0,0,"As chairman, I now rule that we are a standing committee."
20,6,2,"The good news is, I was able to get you moved out of your cubicles..."
17,2,0,"Now, do we understand each other?"
18,2,0,You're all literally on your way out of this company
21,3,2,"Let's get this straight, balancing the budget is just part of the problem...."
19,0,1,So what if I voted for TRUMP. It was only the Primary!
17,0,0,Let me give you a brief history before we explore the rest of Pisa.
18,3,0,I'm leaning that way.
18,0,1,I just wanted your angle on the motion.
18,2,0,"I don't MEAN to talk down to you, but....."
19,4,1,"You may be wondering why our architecture and design firm is closing, effective immediately . . ."
20,3,1,"Why not credit my not having decided to put wheels on the table, too?"
18,0,0,And now for a new slant.......
20,7,2,"In the future, a simple ""nay"" would be sufficient."
17,1,0,...and now I invite you to share your perspective.
18,2,0,"Well, Lois, as the chairman of this board, no, I don't see things going downhill."
18,3,0,We've updated our corporate culture. Only winners. No more level playing field.
18,6,1,The weight of opinion seems to be against me.
19,9,1,"We must right this ship, people..."
20,4,1,"Welcome to Advanced Business Jargon Training. Repeat after me: it is a slippery slope to not give everyone a seat at the table, you're leaning against the idea, but your backs are against the wall."
19,0,0,I think we need to level set.
19,3,2,All those in favor of leaving the building now...
19,5,0,This is not about picking sides.
19,1,1,"Well, well. Looks like the tables have turned."
19,1,1,"In case anyone missed the symbolism, I'm in charge here."
18,3,0,"""In this company you'll need to fight your way up''"
18,6,0,I think we know which way we're leaning. Let's vote on it.
18,3,0,I can see you're all leaning towards no...
21,3,2,First one who makes it to this end of the table gets the corner office.
17,2,0,"As long as I'm heading this network, fair and balanced it will be."
18,6,0,I'm sensing some resistance to my proposal.
18,0,0,Can all the women please lean in.
17,1,0,I designed it like Steinbrenner's Yankee boardroom.
21,3,2,"If any of you oppose, I will literally crush you."
18,1,0,I get the feeling that none of you are leveling with me.
17,2,0,Today's focus group discussion is on paradigm shifts...
20,3,3,This meeting is an uphill battle.
18,0,1,It's your perspective that's skewed Johnson.
18,1,1,"Guys, we all know I'm not the only one who voted for Brexit."
19,7,1,I had this room built to make a point.
18,4,0,"Whatever happened to ""Gesundheit?"""
21,1,2,"""A level playing field is not an idea whose time has come, is that clear ?"
20,5,1,...and that is why I think I'd be a great fit at the Acme Seesaw Company.
18,4,1,I didn't mean this arrangement to imply an imbalance of power.
20,2,3,"All in favor of stationary chairs, raise your hands."
19,4,1,"Okay, then, all those in favor of moving our offices out of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, say 'Aye'."
21,2,1,"And I think it's safe to say, the uncontroversial Brexit vote went rather smoothly, virtually unnoticed by the rest of the world."
18,1,0,"Ok, I get it. Boats, casters. Not an option."
17,3,0,Now you know why I'm always at the head of the table.
18,3,0,no I don't things have gone downhill here
18,2,0,We're moving the home office.
19,6,2,All those in favor of adding brakes to our chairs...
19,1,1,"What do you mean, you feel alienated from management?!"
19,2,1,So by now I hope you all understand the difference between slant and spin.
16,2,0,Any thoughts on our second quarter trajectory?
19,0,1,Am I the only pro-Trump guy here?
20,3,3,I want you all to be aware of the gravity of our situation.
19,3,0,I'm sensing a seismic shift in your position.
18,7,0,At least they hung the window properly
16,0,0,But I said 'safety'.
20,4,1,I thought we'd try a new angle
19,4,1,I believe you all understand the gravity of our situation.
16,1,0,Don't be alarmed. It's just a drill.
19,1,0,At this company we like to keep things on a level playing field.
18,2,0,Something about this quarter feels uneven to me.
17,3,0,"Not what I meant by lean business, people!"
17,0,0,"I am sorry about the room, but Mr. Dernavich has had a little too much to drink."
19,7,2,I move to table the question and let it slide.
19,7,0,I see the room has shifted.
19,0,1,your grandfather's will leaves all his worldly goods to his cat!
18,0,0,Good to hear that you are getting in on the ground floor of our intergallactic marketng model!
18,0,0,May anyone who'd accuse this firm of crookedness lay his cards on the table.
20,2,1,"Again, I want to assure you my political opinions are NOT contagious"
19,0,1,"Pisa? No, never heard of it."
21,0,2,I'll have no more talk of our company being in decline.
19,4,0,We need to regain our perspective.
19,0,1,Are there any questions?
18,2,0,"All those in favor of proceeding with the leveraged buyout, say ""Aye."""
20,3,1,Standing desks are out. Hiking desks are in!
18,0,0,Can I safely assume this is a hostile takeover?
18,1,0,"In closing, it appears to be smooth sailing for Titanic Steamship Limited Partners."
19,5,1,Welcome to our first corporate retreat at sea. Any questions?
19,4,2,No even one of you has anything to bring to the table?
17,1,0,"So, as all of you have probably noticed, we have tied together sales numbers with wheel lock tightness. If you roll yourself out the door you might as well keep on rolling."
18,0,0,"OK, which one of you ordered these goddamn chairs!"
18,0,0,"Okay Hillary, you wanted in? When I let go, you're first in the line of fire."
19,4,2,I think we're on the edge of something really big.
19,4,0,I did list bowling among my hobbies
18,6,0,I sense a bias here.
19,1,1,I'd like to ask publically which one of you called me condescending?
19,6,0,These cruise ship staff meetings would go a lot smoother if Jeff hadn't ordered us rolling chairs.
20,3,1,"As you can see, I've got the leverage."
21,0,3,Of course management values your opinions.
18,2,0,I have to concede that my perspective has been somewhat off recently.
18,2,0,"In hindsight, perhaps moving the office overseas into the Tower of Pisa wasn't such a great idea after all."
18,3,0,"On the bright side, the company ski team remains undefeated."
17,3,0,And our sales have been sliding also .
21,2,4,"All those in favor of keeping the roller chairs, vote aye"
18,1,0,Slippery slope or not--we have to find a level playing field!
18,0,0,Now that I have your undivided attention ...
18,3,0,That's the last time I demand a roll call vote.
17,0,0,You'll have to admit it was a blast having 30 seconds of weightlessness.
17,0,0,Thanks to our architecture interns for their contribution to our New Horizons program.
19,3,1,This is no fun house. It is simply a pivot to the right.
18,1,0,"Look, if it's too hard to roll back just try to spread out a little."
19,3,1,Let's look at this from my perspective
17,0,0,"Okay, which one of you took the Ouiji ball?"
17,0,0,"Okay, I'm biased, that's sort of obvious, isn't it? But what are you going to do about it?"
19,2,1,"Politically, however, we lean to the left."
18,1,0,"All right! All those in favor of purchasing a gyroscope, raise your hand."
18,1,0,"In all fairness, those at one end of the table deserve the same as those at the other."
17,2,0,"I had an agenda, but I see the listing has already begun."
19,4,1,Executive compensation will be based on your ability to remain at the table.
17,2,0,First item on our agenda is the deck chair rearrangement update.
18,0,0,"Yes, as an ode to James Cameron and DiCaprio's 'Titanic', please consider me the King of the World."
18,1,0,The front office wanted this directive to come from above.
20,2,2,"Just wait till the floor drops, too!"
19,3,1,Success has always been an uphill struggle.
18,0,0,I've decided to let go of managerial control and delegate.
17,3,0,"And, finally, I yield the floor to an agenda item carried over from our last session: sinkholes and conference-room traction."
18,1,0,"Think of me as a one percenter, you as the rest of the global business community."
19,5,2,"Those who think we need to be merged and acquired, crawl toward me."
22,1,2,The moment when Bill suspects his aftershave lotion is too strong.
18,0,0,It's who you know....
17,0,0,The foundation of this company is rock solid.
19,2,0,"Now, who's going to supervise the turnaround?"
18,0,1,Memo to self: get better deodorant.
20,2,1,Modern architects only care about the exterior.
17,1,0,We're doing well....on a sliding scale.
20,2,1,Keep your competitors close—but not too close.
18,0,0,We apologize for the inconvenience. The White House will be made level once we've compensated for the new president's ego.
18,2,0,I guess I don't have to tell you that our business is down.
21,3,2,Not until we figure out who's passing gas!
18,2,0,It's time to balance the budget.
21,3,2,We're here to get a report on the progress in the suit against the architects.
20,3,1,As a temporary fix we will remove all the casters.
17,0,0,"Anyway, ciao to those of you who are new to our most recent branch office, the Tower of Pisa."
20,0,2,Look at the big picture. It’s level.
20,1,3,"Ok then, it's agreed. We'll move our offices from Park Slope to Flatbush."
18,0,0,You don't believe in global warming? Let me introduce you to gravity!
19,5,0,Anyone want to weigh in on this discussion?
18,2,0,The resolution to table the committee membership has passed . . .
19,5,0,So what do you think of my proposal? Leaning one way or another?
20,1,1,"""How sad that your gravitational shift in thinking has polarized further discussion""."
20,4,0,"What can I say? I'm an ""up"" kinda guy."
21,2,2,Welcome to our first board meeting at the tallest skyscraper in the world.
18,0,0,"Most managers would be like, ""A skinless, one-eyed giant is chasing me, I'll just skip the Monday morning strategy meeting."" Not me."
19,5,2,I vote that this is our last meeting at the Museum of Modern Art.
19,0,0,"Guy in the left (David Cameron), people in the right (UN) Text: ""At least we can dwell on it""."
18,8,1,Before we begin I would like to get something straight.
18,0,0,"Oh no, we are crooked."
21,5,4,Now you understand why our new cologne isn't selling.
18,0,0,"Next time, please remember that raising both hands does not count as two votes."
18,0,0,"Let's face it, you all need to be more inclined."
17,1,0,"OK, I'll start using a different mouthwash!"
17,3,0,Welcome to the inaugural meeting of Titanic Enterprises.
19,4,2,You've all heard of the Tipping Point...
22,3,4,"In hindsight, the three-bean chili for lunch wasn't the best idea."
19,4,1,"Martha, can you please lean in?"
22,1,5,Show of hands: fix the foundation or remove the wheels from the chairs.
21,13,5,Welcome to orientation.
18,2,0,"Being that we are a office chair company, I thought that a tilting conference room may inspire you to come up with a braking system design."
19,1,0,"Obviously what we have here is a ""right-leaning"" focus group."
19,7,2,Didn't anyone think that hiring my brother-in-law to build this building was a bad idea?
22,4,0,We've slid into a slight downturn.
20,2,1,We are no longer a flat organization.
17,1,0,So am I the only liberal?
22,0,3,We're on a very slippery slope here.
18,1,0,"Here at Tilt Inc., we don't really have a work-life balance..."
18,1,0,This debate is lopsided!
19,4,0,"OK, who wants to take the lead on the sinkhole story?"
20,2,1,I don't think that you really understood the gravity of the situation.
18,2,0,I think I've figured out why you've all been feeling like things are going downhill lately.
20,3,1,"In lieu of raises, I'm giving affectionate hugs."
18,1,0,well how else does it flow downhill?
18,3,0,Do you really think the weight of opinion is with you?
20,1,1,Feta cheese has been removed from the lunchroom selections.
19,5,0,Today I'll talk about Brexit and its minor effect on us.
20,3,2,But does the Marketing Data say the ship is sinking?
17,2,0,Who ordered these Herman Miller chairs without caster locks?
19,7,1,We have got to get rid of these wheels
20,4,1,Maybe relocating to Pisa wasn't such a good idea.
18,2,0,I'll take that as a definite maybe.
19,4,0,"So, perhaps having the conference on a cruise was not the best idea."
18,1,0,I don't see the upside to your proposal.
20,2,3,"Well, as you can see, the company is going down hill."
17,1,1,We're all aware here of the gravity of this situation
19,0,1,Stop tickling my palm-It makes me uncomfortable.
21,2,2,You need to have strong hands to keep your seat at this table.
18,0,0,Yes I rule by fiat even if you have shifted to the right and the ship is listing! Trump that if you will!
17,0,0,Who forgot the mints again?
19,6,0,First time in the Pisa conference room?
20,4,2,I think you’ll find our earnings chart looks more profitable from that angle.
18,1,0,"If you recall, I voted AGAINST hiring ""EconoBuild""."
18,0,1,I guess by know you all know we've decided to go with a sliding scale.
18,3,0,Anyone leaning a different way?
18,4,0,Simon didn't say raise both hands
19,4,1,Could somebody please straighten the picture on the wall again?
18,0,0,I brought you here today as equals to give your unique perspective and avoid the herd mentality.
18,1,0,I know I have a lopsided point of view but I'm the boss.
23,3,6,It appears that the discussion has tilted in my favor.
19,3,0,I need 3 volunteers to help me fix this situation.
17,2,0,"We've tried many ways to get people off their laptops in meetings, but this has been the most effective"
19,5,0,I remain on higher ground despite your unity!
18,1,0,"Alright, let's table that for the next meeting."
20,1,1,What gives you the idea I'm not in your corner?
19,3,1,"As your new CEO, I assure you I firmly believe in a level playing-field."
18,2,0,Our company is on the upswing.
20,3,0,"And for my next trick, you're all fired!"
19,3,0,I'm the board's new independent director.
20,4,1,I'll repeat. I need one volunteer to relocate to our location in Trenton.
18,6,0,I'm not certain this is the right committee to balance the budget.
21,2,2,It's obvious which way the room is leaning
18,2,0,This room is as straight as this Will.
18,2,0,Just push your chair away from the table.
18,1,0,It appears the vote is tipping in your direction.
18,0,0,"What, exactly, did you think ""straighten this thing out"" meant?"
19,0,1,WE WILL NOW BEGIN OUR SEMINAR ON UPWARD MOBILITY
17,3,0,I've been saying this Board was on a slippery slope for years!
17,2,0,"No, I don't believe that playing on a level playing fiels is an option."
19,0,1,I'm inclined to oppose your table.
17,8,0,I'm sure you agree that we need to keep this company on an even keel.
19,2,1,The motion to move the conference room to a lower floor is seconded.
18,6,0,Let the record show that it's 7 to 1 in favor of level floors.
21,1,2,Lunch today will be sticky rice.
18,3,0,I can see my new program for the company to expand is causing a wee bit of listing.
19,1,1,Don't take this to be an us vs. them situation.
21,3,2,Who says that I look down on them?
17,0,0,"Yes Dolly, we did sign the lease sight unseen."
18,6,1,Perhaps you can now understand how it feels to be a share of our stock.
17,2,0,"Yes, I can see how you might take that slant..."
19,5,0,"As you can tell, things here at the company seen to be going downhill."
18,3,0,What makes you think things around here are not on the level?
17,3,0,I get the impression that someone is rocking the boat.
19,6,0,I see you have all weighed in with your opinions
18,7,2,"'First, welcome to Pisa.'"
18,1,0,"I know this is late, but I'm a new reader & just saw the 6/27 issue & couldn't resist sending 2 captions: ""It's poker night and we could use a fourth."" OR ""It's OK, we drink responsibly."""
21,3,3,I should've had a V8.
18,0,1,Why do you think you are qualified for this position?
18,1,0,The position has already been filled.
18,1,0,"As many of you feared, OSHA has banned corporate ladders. But, being an Equal Opportunity employer, you all have the same chance to roll your way to the top."
18,2,0,I'm terribly sorry but we're going to have to postpone addressing the glass ceiling.
18,2,0,"As you can see, my level-playing-field policy has us well-positioned for what comes next."
18,0,0,"Frankly, I think we need a more cohesive round table."
19,1,1,"As you can see by the slope of this room, sales are down."
18,2,0,"Yes, you have the numbers. But that doesn't necessarily mean you have the high ground."
22,11,6,Many of you are concerned with the direction our company is heading.
18,8,0,Now that I have your attention...
17,1,0,The last board meeting on the Titanic.
20,3,2,We're restructuring so you're going to have to roll with it.
20,2,3,Seven architects and not one of you noticed the window was crooked?
20,4,3,"This board decision may tilt in your favor, but as chair I may still decide to crush you with this table."
21,6,3,It looks like the balance of power has shifted.
21,2,2,"As I said, everyone slides right into their role"
18,3,0,"First, who is the bonehead that scheduled this meeting on a boat?"
21,2,1,Now here's my slant on the problem.
19,1,0,Sorry. company bylaws don't include earthquakes as a valid reason to adjourn board meetings.
18,1,0,"Okay, motion overwheeled."
20,3,1,I suddenly feel like the United Kingdom.
18,1,0,"As you know, we're facing a shifting landscape."
17,4,0,"According to the latest polls, there is a noticeable tilt to the right."
21,3,2,It's called trickle-down ergonomics.
20,4,1,It's lonely at the top.
17,3,0,And then it hit me...the concept of what flows downhill is perfect for our boardroom.
21,2,4,I don't think you all fully appreciate the gravity of our situation...
17,8,0,I'm sensing a bias in the room.
20,4,1,Can't anyone hang the art straight?
17,1,1,I think you all appreciate the gravity of this situation.
20,5,1,We are not going to let this slide.
18,1,0,Why do I always have to go last?
18,1,0,All aboard.
20,4,1,And I don't want any cliches.
20,1,2,You thought I was kidding when I said this company needs a sea change?
18,1,0,A pinball machine company with a tilted floor. Who's brilliant idea was that?
19,0,1,"Well, this just got more awkward, but what I said was all of you ARE let go"
21,6,3,Maybe Gehry wasn't the best choice for the interior.
19,2,1,"OK,team, we've survived the tipping point. How big do we guess the black swan will be?"
18,0,0,"Hillary, you're fired! (Optional: he's such a buffoon)"
17,3,0,This isn't working. We need to develop a better slant!
18,2,0,Is it the work of our 3-D Virtual Reality design team?
17,1,0,Are there any views to the left of the subject?
19,1,1,This is not how I wanted to disrupt the industry.
17,0,0,And all those opposed to the motion signify by resigning.
17,3,0,Let's discuss 'leaning in.'
18,0,0,I know your all older than me....but I brought you here to read my will! Your all out!
20,3,1,I have some bad news. We have a leak.
18,3,0,Sheryl said to LEAN IN not back.
22,7,5,"On second thought, maybe rolling chairs were a bad idea."
18,3,0,Why can't you see management's point of view?
21,1,2,"Schrader, is this another one of your practical jokes?"
19,6,2,I hope you appreciate the gravity of our situation.
18,2,0,"To be completely fair, I was chosen by sliding scale."
17,1,0,"Before we adjourn, let me remind you that all future board meetings of the Museum for Deconstructive Architecture will be held off-site."
19,5,0,Getting to this position was an uphill climb.
18,2,0,I'm afraid it's all downhill from here.
19,5,0,OK folks! The learning curve is going to be a little steeper on this next project.
22,5,3,This meeting of the Fun House Society is hereby called to order.
20,2,1,"Now that I have your final vote, people, let's get the hell to the lifeboats!"
19,5,1,I don't suppose that someone could get me a cup of coffee.
19,1,1,So am I hired...or should I take my hand off the table?
18,1,0,"As CEO, I deem this a level playing field between me and my subordinates."
18,0,1,"As you all know, it's been a topsy-turvy quarter."
19,5,2,"A simple ""nay"" would have sufficed."
17,0,0,can't believe you can't embrace my ideas!
20,4,1,The annual meeting of the M.C. Escher Society will now come to order.
20,5,2,"First off, we never promised you level playing field."
18,1,1,I'd like to welcome everyone to our Tokyo office.
18,3,0,It doesn't really matter. I still have eight votes.
20,9,2,"A simple ""nay"" vote would have sufficed."
18,0,0,We may now vote on the steerage of this company.
19,0,1,We work on a sliding pay scale.
19,6,0,Brilliant! We'll put brakes on the chairs.
18,1,0,Who moved the meeting to the Titanic?
21,3,2,"If you feel like victims of bias now, just wait 'til I let go of this table."
17,1,0,"Our mission here at Gravity, Inc. is to prove it's not just a theory."
18,5,0,Gravity is 90% mental
20,2,2,Who wants a kiss?
20,2,1,What is my angle?
18,6,0,Which one of you tilted the painting?
18,4,0,Rogue waves are actually rather rare
18,5,0,Let me assure you; it only feels like the company is sinking.
17,0,0,So how are we going to right this ship?
18,1,0,"I'm rearranging the deck chairs, the boardroom is listing."
18,2,0,We will need to work together if we are going to right this ship.
17,1,0,Whaddya mean my opinion is slanted?
20,4,1,"Then it's agreed. The next construction job that comes in, someone in the drafting room starts with a level."
19,5,0,You may feel that the weight of the argument is on your side ...
20,3,1,"Alright, who's responsible for hanging the crooked whiteboard?"
19,1,1,We're going to pivot.
19,0,1,If this downward trend continues there will be serious repercussions.
20,2,1,You may be wondering how I got into Upper Management?
18,0,0,So I suppose I don't need to ask your political orientation.
18,2,1,What gives you the impression I talk down to each of you?
18,1,0,"Hang on a minute lads, I've got a great idea."
17,1,0,Now for the downside........
18,1,0,This is not a reflection on recent sales
17,1,0,It bears noting that I only claimed to have a keen eye for PROVERBIAL icebergs.
18,1,1,"I can't hold this table forever, you know."
17,0,0,I'm feeling like this conversation is very lopsided
19,3,1,"Believe me, it will start trickling down very soon."
20,2,1,One final question..do you consider our Titanic Ride realistic enough?
18,1,0,It's not my fault they built the headquarters on unstable ground.
20,5,1,Stay right there and with a little luck the aftershock will slide you right back to your places.
17,9,0,Now you know why I didn't offer you any coffee.
18,0,0,Well you buggers. Any more encouraging observations regarding brexit?
20,3,1,"Now that we are in agreement, we can move on."
18,3,0,The board is concerned with our unbalanced approach.
20,2,2,Why are we meeting on a boat?
20,3,1,This is our new board set-up. Now it's easy to tell who is the boss.
18,0,0,Now if you could remain there for the next two years... I have some critically thinking to accomplish
18,0,0,The level-headed test at a job interview for the new psychiatric polyclinic director.
18,1,0,I understand about the scales of justice...but I'm the senior partner here.
18,2,0,You seem to have moved in another direction......
18,1,0,Hi I'm apart of the Jehovah's Witness and let me tell you about something that is out of this world
19,1,1,"Well, People have you weighed my decision?"
22,0,3,"On second thought, maybe we shouldn't have opened a branch office in Pisa."
21,7,3,The motion to abandon ship passes unanimously.
18,2,0,"Just to be clear, let's put it to a referendum."
21,2,2,We want your free unbiased opinion on this issue.
19,5,2,The company faces an uphill struggle.
20,3,2,Try to see it from my perspective: I'm not looking down on you. You're looking up to me!
18,1,0,I'm sure everybody's heard about the sharp downtown in sales.
20,4,1,I'd like to propose that we purchase chairs without casters.
20,3,2,So what you're saying is our engineering issues are also a metaphor for something?
18,0,0,Just hope you are still interested in investing in the new Titanic.
19,4,2,"All those in favor, say ""Aye, aye!"""
18,0,0,Rio was fantastic!
18,3,0,"Let's talk ""trickle-down management"""
18,1,0,And I'm pleased to report that we've turned the corner on HR. It's all downhill from here.
18,2,0,"We are down in the pols, so everthing if off the table."
19,2,0,"Ok, this Focus Group is to report whether or not your think this speech is a tad slanted."
17,0,0,We're taking a new slant on anti-gravity research.
18,1,0,The evaluation report suggests there is a divergence in strategic perspective among the management group.
21,3,3,I must level with you about this.
20,4,2,I've got to level with you.
18,0,1,It is becoming clearer and clearer as I speak that our sector of the economy is no longer a level playing field.
18,0,1,"And now that everyone's had their say, I think we can adopt my plan."
19,5,2,"Okay, that takes care of the demotions."
13,3,0,Ok. But what's our angle?
18,0,0,I never let it slide.
18,0,0,"All in favor of bidding on eight Mies van der Rohe dining chairs at The Four Seasons auction, say 'Aye'."
17,0,0,Swedish furniture company rejects?
19,5,2,So it seems that I'm Scotland on this one.
18,0,0,"So, as you can clearly see, that fact tilts things in my favor."
20,2,1,I knew this was going to be noticeable.
18,1,0,And they all moved away from me at the 'Group W' table!
20,3,1,I resent your inference that this business is not on the level
23,8,6,"From where I'm sitting, it's all downhill from here."
21,2,1,Why does it always seem like Frank is talking down to us?
19,5,0,I see sentiment has tilted in your favor.
18,0,1,"This month, we're encouraging group-think."
19,1,1,"I assure you, despite these sales figures, we are not in a sinking ship!"
18,0,0,"Instead of downsizing, we're tumping over."
18,6,0,I suggest that today's focus group is not fairly balanced.
18,3,0,What really makes our company special is our flat leadership structure.
18,6,1,I am getting the feeling you are not with me on this!
18,3,0,I want to poll which way the room is leaning.
20,4,1,Thank you all for weathering this current downturn.
19,5,0,"We want you, as jurors, to understand the concept of tipping the scales of justice."
19,5,0,"metaphorically, we have something going on here, don't we?"
18,1,0,This is NOT me looking down on you plebeians.
21,0,2,I have no idea.
20,2,1,This will be the last time we meet on the Lusitania.
21,1,4,Good! Now don't move as I crush you with this table.
19,8,2,The motion is carried by a landslide
19,0,0,We seem to be on opposite sides of our product strategy.
20,7,2,"Ok, so moving offshore does have some drawbacks."
21,11,4,"OK, I'll level with you."
21,2,1,I can see this is going to be an uphill battle.
19,2,1,"""Reports circulating that company is going downhill are simply not true""."
19,0,1,I guess you're all wondering why I've gathered you here today.
17,0,0,Someone please put the picture straight
19,1,1,New slogan: Lean Forward!
21,1,2,We need to pivot.
20,3,1,I'll take that as a no.
16,0,0,This company's going downhill.
17,0,0,"Well, the earthquake can help us take a new slant on our business. We said we'd turn things around."
20,5,1,"So you heard, I just got back from Rio!"
19,0,0,You must admit...I have a good angle on this project.
18,5,1,"So, I think it's fair to say that we've reached our tipping point."
18,0,0,Let's say 10% of any income generated by the new circles and call it a deal.
17,1,0,"Tonight I'm announcing our new multi-purpose office product - the See-Saw Board Room. To make the room level, the majority of you must come to Board Chair's side."
18,0,0,"When the Ship of State lists to the right, we need to take the high side."
20,4,1,"Sadly, our productivity has waned since we did away with the bean bag chairs."
20,8,3,I want to begin by saying the foundation of this company is as solid as ever.
17,1,0,Welcome to the no fear of paranoia seminar.
18,1,0,Quit complaining. You wanted a tilt toward democracy and now you've got it.
18,2,0,We've decided to downsize.
18,1,0,I see the balance has shifted.
18,1,0,"The consultants report came back and, to my complete surprise, it says we are particularly heavily staffed in people attending useless meetings. Well I think that about covers it. See everyone next week."
17,3,0,Don't be concerned. This 3D app is a Beta and will straighten itself out with the next download.
21,6,3,It would seem that I have the table.
18,1,0,I'm afraid we're on our way to falling through the cracks.
18,2,1,Who said management is not approachable?
19,1,1,The meeting of the Titanic deck band is hereby adjourned.
18,0,0,In five years I see myself being more disruptive.
20,3,2,"On the other hand,upper management will be fine."
19,1,1,It appears you are leaning in a different direction.
21,3,1,So we all agree on the gravity of this situation?
20,7,2,I'm concerned that getting everyone to the table might be an uphill battle.
19,4,2,I appreciate how heavy this matter has been weighing on you.
19,1,1,I'm afraid I'm not moved by the weight of your argument.
20,3,1,"Believe me, I would really like to level with you guys."
18,0,0,Thjat's five for and two against straightening hte painting.
18,5,0,I want to approach this meeting from a different angle.
19,1,1,"Yes, I admit things are a bit tilted in my favor."
18,3,0,"You women and minorities have to remember, hard work and dedication will get you places"
20,3,1,None of you seem to grasp the gravity of our situation.
20,3,1,I AM trying to steady the ship!
21,3,2,Like our profits.
20,2,1,Sorry! I forgot to brush my teeth.
18,0,0,I've just been informed that Trump 1 has just landed on the roof ...
18,0,0,Blame yourselves. You're so dense.
18,1,1,We can't deny obvious. You are all in a slump.
20,4,1,"So, it's fair to say you're leaning toward restructuring."
17,2,0,"Look at the silver lining, poor John was carrying up the coffees."
20,4,0,"Here, we believe in a level playing field."
19,0,1,It's a new game I invented...table hockey with a table.
17,2,0,...but perhaps I'm making too light of the situation.
17,0,0,"Sorry. With Brexit, E.U. rules prohibit us from sitting at the same table."
19,6,2,Now do you see the gravity of the situation?
20,0,2,We should have never opened an office in Pisa.
21,2,2,"Ok, I'll stop buying my cologne from the dollar store."
21,1,2,Now the proposal to move from this Pisa Tower office.
17,3,0,I assure you this offer is on the level.
17,2,0,Don't let their slanted testimony sway you.
17,3,0,"When I said I want to put a new slant on things, this wasn't what I had in mind."
18,0,0,"Yes, I'm quite literal and be thankful I didn't go with the ladder idea"
18,1,0,Let's not fool ourselves. Titanic industries needs someone new to right the ship.
18,0,0,"Let's table the motion, establish a frame of reference and move on to the gravity of this matter."
20,3,2,"We're on a roll, people!"
17,1,0,We smell - We hear you Mr. Toot.
17,0,0,"As you have probably guessed, I've highly leveraged the company .."
18,2,0,I'm afraid that your reasoning is something of a slippery slope.
19,0,0,Raise your hand if you haven’t seen the movie “Titanic.”
16,0,0,"While you might find my position untenable, wait until I turn the table!"
23,6,6,We appear to have reached the tipping point.
17,0,0,"We know our jobs here have always been an up hill battle, but isn't this a bit over the top?"
19,5,0,I just really feel like you guys let everything slide.
18,3,0,We're restructuring.
18,2,0,I'm skewed. aren't I?
18,1,1,"Well, I see you are all weighted towards one opinion."
19,1,1,"On that note, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to draw this Pinball Appreciation Society meeting to a close."
19,1,1,Staff meeting at the magnet school.
17,1,0,Prepare to come about!
19,2,1,All right. Meeting on a cruise ship was a bad idea.
17,1,0,"On the plus side, our team photo is now level."
18,1,1,Thank you for participating in our 'Innovations in Architecture' focus group.
19,4,1,"No, I'm pretty sure this is more than just a paradigm shift."
18,6,0,I feel like your perspective on this may be slightly skewed.
17,3,0,"So summing up, the business has been a bit of a roller-coaster lately."
18,2,0,"Really guys, I swear this plan is on the level!"
17,3,0,I think we're becoming a bottom-heavy organisation
21,2,2,"All in favor of purchasing caster cups, say 'aye'."
17,1,0,Meeting adjoined.
17,2,0,Your motion is out of order.
18,2,0,"I don't know how this office would run without you! But as of Monday, I'm going to find out.”"
19,0,1,"Unfortunately for Michael, the acoustics of the room weren't that great."
19,3,1,Need I remind you our fourth quarter goals will be an uphill battle...
18,1,0,I'd like to call us to order . . .
17,2,0,"All board meetings, my dear colleagues, will be slanted in my direction."
21,2,2,Can anyone tell me what's wrong with this picture?
19,1,1,It's lonely at the acute angle
18,2,0,"All those in favor, roll this way in the next wave."
19,2,0,You cannot blame me for this shift in the balance of power.
17,0,0,I am honored to accept the position of Chairman of the Board of The Mystery Spot.
18,1,0,A bit of gum in the wheels does wonders.
18,7,0,One of the many reasons I nail my feet to the floor.
20,1,1,"No, no, I said lean IN."
18,2,0,We can table it. Or I could just let it go.
18,1,0,Wall don't lie.
18,0,0,"Upon closer examination, we felt that the table should not be removed."
18,0,0,Don't worry things are going to go smoothly because the Royals are getting involved.
20,7,3,So moved?
17,1,0,"In my professional opinion, there's been no paradigm shift."
18,2,0,"On a sliding scale, how do you think you did?"
18,0,0,We've deregulated the conference room.
19,4,2,"Is it just me, or have we lost our perspective, people?"
18,0,0,"In our organization, we roll--not climb--up. Good luck!"
18,1,0,"From where I sit, it should be a go....."
19,2,0,"C'mon, people, this isn't the Titanic....yet."
19,3,1,"As you've probably guessed, we're on a bit of a downslide."
17,2,0,I'm sensing you are all leaning against my proposal
20,4,1,"Yes, it is a slippery slope and you are all fired."
21,2,2,We need a new angle.
18,3,0,Next order of business on the homeowners agenda is to address the neighborhood sinkhole problem
23,4,4,"I never talk down to people, if I can help it. I can't help it."
19,5,0,"Perhaps, I should level with you."
19,5,2,Why have we stopped serving coffee at our meetings?
19,4,0,This meeting seems a little one-sided
17,0,0,Thanks for connecting!
17,1,0,"Despite your recent performance dragging us down, the big picture of our company remains level."
17,1,0,Nobody puts a Trump voter in a corner!!!
19,1,1,This is what your shareholders feel like when the chart of their investments goes from top left to bottom right.
18,1,1,The majority weighs in.
18,0,1,The following adjustments have been made to accommodate the CEO's vertigo...
18,0,0,What else can I do to show you who's boss?
17,3,0,Southern California has many other advantages !
18,3,0,I told you it would be a slippery slope.
18,2,0,We're experiencing some market turbulence this quarter.
19,0,0,How will we take a selfie our Gadget-free Society?
13,1,1,I just don't see the upside.
20,1,1,I think we need to get some perspective.
19,3,1,So you're saying my argument doesn't carry that much weight?
18,4,0,I wanted you to get a different perspective on our growth chart.
20,6,3,I'm just hoping Frank Gehry will give us a partial refund.
18,1,0,I'm inclined to think that we could use an aftershock.
19,2,2,"Perhaps it comes as no surprise, the company is slipping."
17,0,0,Somebody take a peek out the window--is there any kind of post-Brexit world out there at all?
20,4,0,"I think you misunderstood my ""Operation Lean"" memo."
18,0,0,I'm using my anti-gravity chair
18,1,0,I warned you about taking a slanted viewpoint.
19,4,0,I suspect you'll all be inclined to agree with my proposal.
18,2,0,Your grandfather directed that the picture be hung catty-whompus.
20,2,1,"From where I sit, there's no need to explore unionization."
17,1,0,I didn't tell you..instead of building a wall I am just changing gravity!
18,3,0,"As you know, I was hired to right this ship."
18,1,0,The downside is significant.
18,1,0,I want the editorials to tilt to the right! Not you guys!
18,1,0,"So, that's how it's going to be?"
18,2,0,A motion to order lunch.
19,1,1,Everything is always on the level at this company.
17,1,0,Just a reminder that your seat at the table is not guaranteed.
17,0,0,"Hillary, it's all your fault."
18,2,0,Need I remind you the ship is sinking?
22,3,3,I wanted to make sure we started with your backs against the wall
19,0,1,"As you know, we're going to have to make some cuts. So, who's idea were the wheels?"
20,4,1,I firmly believe in the balance of power.
19,4,0,Everything is leanear.
21,3,4,Now it will be easier to talk down to you
19,2,1,I can't stress enough how important it is to work together as a group.
19,4,1,We've got a new slant on team bonding.
18,0,0,"Don't worry, that was only a MAG 3 earthquake. The TV tilts above that."
18,1,0,I see the table has turned.
20,5,1,"Gentlemen, I'm not sure you understand the gravity of our situation."
17,3,0,"What shall we tackle next, the glass ceiling or the floor of discontent?"
19,2,0,MEETING MINUTES: Open Issues - New chairs
20,2,1,It's part of the LEAN initiative
18,1,0,Anyone who claims my views are slanted leads a distorted life.
19,7,1,I doubt we will ever see eye-to-eye.
17,1,0,For now on you will look up to me.
20,6,2,I'm afraid we're going to have to make some structural changes.
18,3,0,I move that we level the room or get rid of the chair casters.
18,6,1,Next time don't put the floor plans in cursive.
18,1,0,Now you see why i talk down to you!
19,1,1,What do you mean I am ignoring the majority decision?
18,1,1,So you're saying my views are slanted and out of touch?
18,3,0,"Now, as a politician, you think everything I do is slanted...."
18,3,0,Our first order of business is to find a foundation repair company.
18,3,0,"""They said it was an all-natural deodorant that actually worked."
18,0,0,"And the solution to that issue would be to..... *building tips* ""Never bring your naughty children to work. Especially if they refuse to eat their vegetables and enjoy playing leap frog."
18,2,0,Welcome to my space.
18,1,0,"Welcome to the 10th annual ""People's Bowling Convention."""
18,2,0,"Ok , there, still not intimidated!"
18,3,0,"Well, now that you're all together, we can begin."
19,3,1,Clearly the the number of witnesses weights heavily on this case.
19,2,0,I feel like you have a very slanted world view
18,3,0,Investors will be pleased by the stock reports they see in this room.
20,4,1,Production is down. Sales are down. Profits are down...
19,4,1,Was it something I said?
18,2,0,We're hoping that putting a new slant on these meetings will bring everyone closer.
18,1,0,I've noted that we are a boring group. Unbalanced if you will. Help me understand why that is.
17,3,0,Thank you all for siding with me on the budget cuts.
19,3,0,And lastly. The elephant in the room...I think it is self explanatory.
22,4,5,Let's move on to the next slide.
18,1,0,That's why I'm asking for your help to right this ship.
20,5,1,Whoa.....I think your opinions weigh a lot more than mine!
18,3,0,"As you can see, the outcome tilts in my favor."
20,4,1,I want to put a new slant on things.
20,2,1,I think we can all agree – it’s been an uphill battle AND a slippery slope.
19,7,1,"I know, but the architect just won an award."
20,3,1,I'd appreciate it if you'd level with me.
20,2,1,I think our management team is getting a little top heavy.
18,2,0,"Now that I've given you my slant, I'd be interested to hear yours."
18,3,0,Does this angle make me look fat?
18,1,0,"''If I'm the boss, then why do you guys carry all the weight.''"
17,0,0,"Okay, now you feel comfortable on a listing boat so we'll practice life jackets tomorrow!"""
17,2,0,"Just in case you haven't noticed, this corporation is sinking."
20,4,1,"Now that we've tabled the motion, let's move on."
18,2,0,"Now that it’s clear where this Foundation Repair business is heading, how do we fix it?"
19,5,2,The slide show will begin now!
19,6,1,"You do realize that it's the window that's tilted, don't you?"
18,1,0,Since I am the only one taking the high rode...
18,3,0,"They're called “locking casters.” If you ever expect to move up in this company, you need to start paying attention to detail!"
17,3,0,"That's right, I don't watch Game of Thrones and I'm damn proud of it."
18,7,0,Today we will be discussing a new floor plan.
20,3,2,"Oh, how the table has turned."
17,1,0,"In closing, be prepared for when the business reverses course."
17,0,0,The annual meeting of the Things That List Appreciation Society will now come to order.
18,3,0,"Don't worry, it's only 7.5 on the Richter scale!"
17,1,0,Give me your reports on the slant.
18,2,0,I think we can all agree that it was a mistake hiring an anti-capitalist installation artist to design the new corporate board room.
18,1,0,I really don't like this new trend of turning office buildings into tourist attractions.
18,0,1,I declare our test of the self-leveling TV a rousing success.
18,2,0,My gravitas trumps your gravity.
21,12,4,"So, other than the wheels, we like the new chairs?"
18,1,1,"In hindsight, when I built this office tower, I should have hired a professional."
17,3,0,Just roll with me for a moment.
19,5,1,Nobody leaves until we straighten this out.
19,7,1,Thank you all for meeting me in Pisa.
17,0,0,"As I explained at the last meeting, the company is serious about shifting the paradigm."
17,5,0,It seems the odds have now tipped in your favor.
20,3,1,I'd like to set the room straight about a few things.
17,1,0,Let's look at this from an ordinary angle.
16,3,0,We are trying to go at this from every possible angle.
18,0,0,Don't fear. Our law firm has always considered earthquakes to be acts of God.
18,2,0,"I assure you, my Trumpism is not contagious."
21,4,1,Your recommendation to straighten out our finances has been rejected.
18,3,0,We've reached the tipping point.
18,3,0,Now that I have the floor...
18,3,0,"This is trickle down, people!"
18,0,0,"In short, Titanic Industries is on its way up and ready to deep dive into exciting new territory."
20,2,2,Now you shall see the gravity of the situation that our company is in.
19,0,1,"Remember, we are in the Leaning Tower of Pisa."
18,0,0,I _knew_ we shouldn't have put the boardroom inside the giant pendulum.
18,2,0,"So after weighing in on the matter, I suppose this means no?"
21,3,2,"The good news is, sales are flat."
19,5,0,There has been a seismic shift in our industry
20,3,1,"First, let me put to rest the rumors that we're a sinking ship."
18,0,0,which one of you have the paper trail?
18,0,0,im sure we can reach an amicable solution that we will all be happy with
19,3,1,"I'm really, really, proud of our company. We started fracking last week and we're already getting results!"
18,2,0,You need to help me to understand why our employees say that crap rolls downhill in our company
19,4,1,Our landlord contends we must have defective furniture and astigmatism.
19,5,0,"You may be correct and unified, but your thoughts are slanted."
19,4,0,"So, are you guys leaning one way or the other on this?"
17,0,0,The good news is the earthquake flat
18,2,0,"As you may have guessed, Corporate is starting to lean to the right."
20,4,1,"To commence our new Fit for Work, Fit for Life regimen, we're asking you all to scoot your chairs up to the table ten times."
19,5,0,Why do I always get the feeling you guys are siding against me?
20,5,3,"All right, OK... I'll level with you."
20,4,1,You're slant is totally wrong. Look at the big picture.
18,1,0,The non-wheeled chairs should be here by next week.
17,1,0,"Well, maybe if you weren't all sitting on one side..."
19,1,1,I see this is going to end in a hung jury.
20,4,1,This was the most affordable space.Now lets discuss the rolling chairs.
19,4,1,Didn't I specifically say to order the chairs without wheels?
19,2,1,"NOW THAT WE'RE ALL SETTLED IN, LET'S GET TO WORK."
17,0,0,"Don't worry, we're only temporarily leveling the playing field."
21,1,3,Our first order of business is to discuss the gopher problem.
18,0,0,This company has never stood for a level playing field.
20,3,1,There are a number of things that we need to straighten out.
23,4,4,I can see which way the room is leaning on this one.
18,7,1,"So, you're leaning towards a consensus."
19,4,0,Our strategy is all about levelling the playing field.
18,2,0,"Our tagline is, ""We put a different slant on it!"""
19,0,0,Rolling chairs show you the bottom line.
23,5,4,To save money we had to let about half of the 34th floor go.
21,4,4,"We are facing an uphill battle, but I would like to get rolling."
17,3,0,They told me it was only an illusion.
18,3,0,FYI - I'm still billing for this.
21,3,1,"All in favor of abandoning ship, say aye."
17,3,1,It's management's way of reminding us that upward mobility is something we have to work for.
20,3,1,And this is why I'm now inclined toward an early roll out.
19,4,2,Who thought it was a good idea to have the Board meeting on a cruise ship?
18,0,0,"its bad to have every thing in the (world) but I feel like the ""lone ""ranger"
18,1,0,Who turned off the Market equilibrium?
18,1,0,"Fortunately, nobody was injured in this morning's earthquake. In terms of business, it will be downhill for awhile."
22,5,2,"All in favor of closing the Pisa office say, ""Aye!"""
20,3,2,The figures for the second quarter are titanic.
17,1,0,It turns out I was actually holier than thou...
20,3,2,"Look, I know a lot of you aren't thrilled by the sudden transfer from London to our office in Pisa."
18,3,0,"You see, here at Trump University, it's all about balance - balancing your work load, balancing your staff, and balancing your check book. We teach your how to rise above all of that nonsense..."
19,4,1,It appears that negotiations have shifted in your favor
21,3,2,First order of business; let's fix that window.
18,5,0,We've finally reached the tipping point.
19,3,1,"Sorry about that, I had a burrito for lunch"
17,1,0,"My course on abstract committee-room design was delightful, thanks for asking!"
18,2,0,This quarter's shaping up as a real roller coaster.
20,4,1,I reject the notion that the Brexit result has been seismic.
20,3,1,"Now that the buyout has been completed, you may notice some changes in the corporate chart."
19,5,1,It's not just about getting to the top; it's about staying at the top.
21,2,3,"PLEASE, call me Eileen."
22,4,5,I think we're too far to the right on this.
17,0,0,The good news is that it's all uphill from here.
17,1,0,I told you NOT to quote Emily Dickinson.
20,5,3,I'd appreciate it if you would just level with me.
19,0,1,"OK, this meeting of the Titanic Toastmasters will come to order."
18,3,0,"I don't care what this looks like, you're selling ""level!"""
19,4,0,It's an optical illusion folks!! Get back to the table!
17,1,0,There is a downside to our family policy.
18,0,1,But juror eight always gets to decide what's for lunch.
20,3,2,Welcome to the construction oversight committee.
20,3,1,"C'mon, just level with me!"
18,2,0,"Ilean, you have the floor."
18,0,0,Blame it on Brexit.
18,2,0,"Okay, who greased the casters ?"
18,0,0,This country's economy is sliding.
18,0,0,Trump University (Sign on wall) I'm the 1%. See how I did that?
19,6,0,This isn't what I meant when I said we should move some of our staff around
17,2,0,What else do you want to know about me? I think I have an interesting slant on most things. That and bad breath.
19,1,1,The 'move to table' is out of order.
19,1,1,Your manner of assembly suggest I'm preaching to the choir.
18,3,0,It looks level to me.
18,6,0,You guys are real downers!
20,4,2,I want the architecture committee in my office. RIGHT NOW!
20,4,1,Anyone still thinking I was kidding when I said your backs are against the wall?
17,3,0,I think if we get our expenses down we can level things off this quarter.
18,1,1,This actuarial table will help us balance the books.
18,0,0,It could be worse. We could be on a ship!
18,1,0,"I think it's part of his pitch."""
19,3,0,I suppose you're wondering why I've gathered you together?
18,2,0,Apparently I am the only Democrat on this Right Leaning Board.
20,5,0,The gravity of this situation sure has pulled us together.
20,1,2,"""All those in favor of gravity say 'aye' ""."
19,4,0,"With the next wave, grab hold of the table."
18,4,0,Ironically our share price is rising.
17,3,0,The Power of the one out weighs the needs of the many.
23,7,4,"As you all know, moving up in this company can be difficult."
18,1,0,Now I know why our sales have been slipping!
20,2,1,Just as long as you know your places.
17,2,0,"I appreciate your input, but I'm the boss and I say the building's not falling over."
19,1,1,There's room for a Kate Winslet up here.
18,0,0,"And the last item on the agenda, who would like to volunteer to mentor our newest and youngest employee who will probably be your boss in a year?"
19,10,1,Let me try and put this into perspective.
17,8,0,Could you all just lean in?
20,5,2,It appears the board is not leaning in my favor.
18,0,0,so now you're all teetering?
19,4,2,There will be a reduction in middle management.
18,1,1,I'd like to welcome you all to the Bay Area.
20,2,1,See the difference between voting and non-voting stock?
17,1,0,Today we will study Trickle Down Theory.
18,1,0,ok - you've rocked the boat!
19,6,1,Level with me.
19,4,0,I wish you'd all just be straight with me.
18,3,0,I've got a feeling our survival is teetering.
18,9,1,I see you're all inclined to disagree.
21,3,2,The vote is unanimous to purchase a new plumb bob.
18,0,0,Yet another example of intellectual dishonesty.
18,0,0,"Well, if there's no other new business, I think we can adjourn."
20,2,3,I've got a different slant on the issue.
17,0,0,note to self: no more chili for lunch
17,3,0,Now that I graduated from Trump University there are going to be some changes around here.
19,2,0,"I'd invite you to sit back, relax and enjoy the meeting."
18,6,1,"Ok, I'll admit it: Headquartering the company on international waters wasn't worth the tax breaks."
20,5,1,"Yes, Brexit has had unintended consequences."
20,4,2,This board seems to be going downhill.
20,4,1,I knew you were all leaning that way from the moment I sat down.
19,1,1,"So, as I was saying, the trip to Rio was great."
21,2,2,I usually hate all things European but this Dutch architecture is growing on me.
19,8,3,"Well, Bill, it looks like you won because of a landslide."
19,3,1,Are you sure?
19,2,1,"I know what you're thinking, but it could just as easily have gone the other way."
22,7,8,This meeting is getting away from me.
20,3,1,It only goes downhill from here.
20,0,0,… so we’ll be trying the brake test again tomorrow…
17,2,0,"People, this is the opposite of leaning in."
18,0,0,"Well, I'm not sure who came up with the idea of a level playing field, but you can get that silly notion out of your heads right now."
20,2,1,Just which of you bitchy low-lifes feels I don't provide a level playing field?
18,4,0,I suppose that now you believe me when I say the company is going downhill.
17,3,0,Does this mean all options are off the table?
21,2,1,"This caption is from my wife, Donna Barnett: "" I'm inclined to disagree with you all on this one."""
18,1,1,Sorry about the garlic.
18,1,1,"First, I want to address my concerns about the outstanding balance I found in all of your accounts..."
19,5,2,Excellent slide show.
23,4,4,I'm inclined to agree.
18,0,0,"Well, what do you think? Will this reclinable building sell better than the reclinable chairs?"
21,1,2,"As I'm sure my fellow board members, ours is an industry in decline."
18,1,0,We have get leaner and meaner -but mostly leaner!
18,0,0,"I don't mean to shout, team. But it's your angle I'm most frustrated with."
20,0,1,"Even without having to fight ""The Laws of Gravity"", winning you over to my side was always going to be difficult."
18,1,1,I never said it was a level playing field.
18,2,0,Gladwell's point taken.
18,1,0,The long range plan is to be sure my vote always carries the most weight.
19,4,0,"Like I told you, our new super glue really works!"
17,0,0,I'm afraid Brexit is taking us down with it.
17,1,1,The good news is this quarter we were able to move off the level playing field.
21,0,2,My decision tilts heavily against.
18,0,0,"Now, which of you suggested that we need an ombudsman?"
19,5,1,Did anybody else feel that?
17,1,0,What I am proposing is that we all get on equal footing.
21,2,2,Open Wide.
20,3,2,I thought it would be lonelier up here.
19,1,1,Thanks for the report on corporate fairness. Next up: board restructuring.
18,0,0,"So all those in favor of moving our annual meeting off the Titanic next year, say 'aye.'"
20,0,2,I call this meeting out of order.
19,3,1,Looks like we found our new CEO!
20,5,1,So it's unamimous. The Titanic Directorship votes for Trump.
20,4,1,I'm glad you all realize the gravity of the situation.
18,2,0,"I'm your new CEO, Evan Keel, and I was brought on board to bring to bring stability to the company."
19,5,0,"All those in favor of reducing the seating capacity, carefully raise your hand."
21,3,2,"As I've always told you, it's lonely at the top."
18,1,1,Ready for another weighty decision?
19,1,0,I asked why are you all leaning to the right; it wasn't a mandate
17,2,0,How many of you think this focus group is on the level?
23,7,5,Welcome to the Pisa branch offices.
18,4,0,"Joan, could you slide my pen back?"
20,4,1,It's time we take this company in a new direction.
18,2,0,The decline due to Brexit should be temporary.
18,2,0,The architect overreacted when I complained that the window was crooked.
20,2,1,"I see the tides have turned, but there is no need to exaggerate."
22,3,3,I still think Trump will make a great president.
17,2,0,"Our ""Mystery Boardroom"" gives the illusion of declining profits"
18,2,0,We've up-graded the conference room.
18,1,0,You're not trying to see things from my perspective.
18,1,0,Don't worry. The pendulum will swing back.
21,1,1,Yes we can--Pinball machines out of the arcades and into every home.
18,2,0,What would it take for you to see it my way?
20,4,2,"OK, here's how we're going to sidestep a recall of our levels and plumb bobs."
17,1,0,I can't overstate how much I rely on each of you feeling comfortable speaking up.
17,3,0,"And we thank Jan for this week’s piece of participatory art entitled ""Sisyphus didn't have to do it in heels."""
17,3,0,I think we should get a different perspective.
18,3,0,"So I take it, then, that you feel the same way about Hillary?"
19,6,0,The latest figures suggest we're on the decline.
19,1,1,I understand there have been complaints about the disparity in salaries of management and staff.
18,1,0,I alone can reset my elevator shoes.
17,3,0,"Since no further motion is possible, the meeting is adjourned."
18,1,0,From where I sit y'all are as far right as you can get
20,3,1,"Now that we all understand the new sliding pay scale, let's move to the retirement plan rollovers."
18,1,0,You'll do anything to skew it your way.
17,1,0,We have been accused of a right wing slant with our reporting.
18,2,0,I had to work at it you know. Unlike you lot I didn't just slide into this position.
20,0,0,EU can't sit with me
17,2,0,"Alright, so the next meeting won't be on a boat, and I won't have garlic in my salad."
20,2,1,"We, the Board of the Titanic Corp. ,wish to note the rising tide of uncertainty."
18,5,0,It should be clear by now that making partner here is an uphill battle.
18,1,0,"Now remember, we must honor our commitment to workplace equality."
20,4,1,"I realize that things have been stressful around the office lately, but I assure you that we're now on the downward slope."
20,2,1,Cutting funds to R&D's project to create sink holes has had some blow back.
18,3,0,It's as if no one around here understands the gravity of the situation
17,0,0,"To make it easier for everyone to lean in, we've built an office that leans out."
17,0,0,"First off, we have to admit our business is undergoing a sea change."
18,1,1,"So, I see that the board is slightly slanted in your favor."
19,5,1,"Just because I'm the boss' son, don't think that things are tilted in my favor."
18,1,1,You're positions are clearly untenable
20,1,1,Do you think you could manage to roll back to your places when the next wave hits?
18,0,1,"That's right losers, Location, Location, Location."
18,3,0,Our company is sinking.
18,0,0,"Get Benny, Steve, and Gretch; then, for God's sake, ditch the chairs! High time I bowled my staff over."
19,1,1,Second the motion?
20,3,1,"Well folks, unfortunately, it appears that this meeting has gone downhill."
17,3,0,I'm happy to see my board members so tightly knit!
18,3,0,"Well, that's my perspective on that issue."
18,3,0,The topic today is litigation against architecture firms.
19,4,0,Cutting-edge architecture is now part of our brand.
18,0,0,Let's exit the EU!
20,5,1,In this company you have to climb the table.
20,4,1,Backsliders! All of you.
18,1,0,Gather around people. What's the matter with y'all?
16,0,0,Your proposal had lots of interesting points but the angle was weak.
21,6,3,Pull up a chair!
20,8,3,First order of business: we fire the architect.
17,1,0,We've got to level the playing field.
18,2,1,I increasingly feel like this Board's weight is unevenly distributed.
21,1,3,Did anyone think to turn on the projector before they sat down?
18,0,0,This is why we should have voted *not* to work in the Leaning Tower of Piza.
19,1,1,Let the minutes reflect that future meetings will be held in conference room C.
17,1,0,I didn't say I was voting for him...I'm undecided.
13,2,1,Firstly I want no talk of a sinking ship !
17,0,0,"Well, this is off to a good start"
17,1,0,You have to be a gravity-shifting ass to occupy this seat.
18,6,2,What do you mean I let you down?
18,1,0,"OK ladies and gentlemen, the voting results are in. The public says this ship is *not* sinking."
21,1,2,"No need to put ' Whoops, damn ! ' in the minutes, Gretchen."
19,3,1,"I promise you, the company is not a sinking ship."
20,4,1,"Now that I have your attention. "" Welcome to Engineering and Design!"
18,0,0,I have a new slant for this weeks meeting
17,0,0,This is why we have a head of the table
20,3,1,Welcome to the Economic House of Mystery.
20,6,3,"On the plus side, it has a wonderful view of downtown Pisa."
19,7,2,I didn't literally mean heads need to roll.
13,3,0,"Yes, my brother-in-law Larry did submit the lowest construction bid. No, he has never heard of a level."
18,0,0,Hard work got me where I am today.
21,4,0,"I want to assure the members of the board, that the perception of an imbalance between yourselves and me, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, is completely unfounded. Thank you."
19,1,1,I see the boards view is a little off kilter this morning.
17,3,0,It seems like we're in a quarterly decline.
18,0,0,I seem to have you at a disadvantage!
18,1,0,The advantage of being at the head of the table with earth shattering news!
19,5,1,"In conclusion, let me assure the board that this business is in no way a sinking ship."
19,4,2,I cannot stress enough the gravity of the situation.
20,6,2,"Here, you will need to claw your way to the top."
20,3,1,Can anyone give me a new slant on this situation?
18,1,0,Today I'm announcing our new employee collaboration program.
19,5,0,None of you -- none of you! -- meets the level of my expectations.
17,3,0,"So, you see, once you make senior vice president, it's all downhill from there..."
18,0,0,I believe the market is turning.
18,1,0,Trick or treat!
18,3,0,Which way are we leaning?
18,3,0,"well Chief, I guess we do look up to you."
20,5,1,I want everyone to try to come to the table on this.
19,7,2,Only now may we fully appreciate the gravity of our situation.
18,1,0,I told you we shouldn't have conference room chairs with wheels!
21,2,2,"Wow, I really taught you guys were on my side"
16,2,0,If you think we're off balance now just wait for the Brexit aftershock.
19,6,0,"Welcome to our annual Descendants of the Titanic meeting, or is it still too soon?"
18,3,0,"Ladies and gentlemen, the landscape of our company is changing."
17,1,1,A shift to the right was necessary to stay in this election race.
20,3,0,Perhaps we can table this vote until we get back to shore.
18,3,0,"Like I told you, it's all downhill from here."
18,3,0,Have we turned the tables yet
20,3,2,For some unknown reason the 'The American Association of Homebuilders' is investigating our construction company.
20,3,1,I assume you now appreciate the gravity of our situation
19,5,0,We're a very conservative think tank.
18,3,0,"Ok, now that we're on even ground, let's discuss raises."
18,3,0,"To summarize, everyone on this side of the table keeps their job......."
19,4,0,I know you think my view point is slanted.....
18,0,0,"Do not be alarmed, Farmer. We are only interested in your seed."
19,0,1,The Pendulum building was built to withstand very high winds with a flexible infrastructure but as you know we recommend brakes on the chairs.
20,3,1,It is imperative that we continue to promote the fact that our news coverage is 'Fair and Balanced.' Agreed?
18,1,0,"Everyone, the company is going sideways!"
17,2,0,I can assure you I am more than capable of balancing a budget.
18,2,0,One more time you morons: What's wrong with this picture?
19,5,0,We clearly need more balance on the Board.
18,0,0,We now have little hope that the Trump and Brexit anomalies will cancel each other out and return balance to our universe.
19,4,0,"The board assures me that we are ,in fact, not sinking."
17,0,0,So I'm British! So sue me!
18,0,0,"No more climbing the ladder to success, from now on is the incline."
20,0,2,So who can guess what's about to roll downhill?
19,0,0,The vote on the direction to rotate the table always results in a tie.
20,5,1,All rise.
20,4,1,"...""the good news is, we're moving our headquarters back to Florence."""
18,0,0,We MUST get this company right-sized and back on track
23,6,7,I see we have reached the tipping point.
18,1,0,"Now that the earthquake has passed, let's call the meeting to order."
20,3,1,Are you suggesting I'm not on the level?
17,1,0,I'd like to remind the liberals that this is a right-leaning company.
20,4,1,Please roll your chair back to the table so we can continue this Sisyphus Corp. Board meeting.
17,1,0,"I like to use the 'slant room' to illustrate the difference between the 1% (me), and the 99% (you)."
18,0,0,Enough puns. Let's discuss the terms of the settlement.
19,0,1,It has come to my attention that we might need to level the playing field
20,5,2,This is a matter of some gravity.
20,4,1,This is a paradigm shift.
20,8,3,"Clearly, groupthink does not lend itself to a balanced solution."
19,7,1,We can't continue to let things slide.
19,2,1,Is it just me or is the painting a little crooked?
19,5,1,"I want to assure all of you,I intend to manage with a level playing field."
17,0,0,You're probably wondering why I brought you together like this.
18,0,0,"Being new to San Francisco , you will get used to working on a hill building."
18,0,0,Think I need a breath mint?
18,1,0,It's a slippery slope.
18,1,0,Welcome to our new post-Gravity conference room
19,2,1,You don't seem to like it so much when the table's turned.
17,0,0,You're all going to have to swing back towards the middle if we're going to have a shot at this one.
18,3,0,"When you position yourself just right, you can avoid the downturn's effects. Understand?"
18,3,1,"Unfortunately, we are not prepared to have lower level employees come to the table"
20,4,1,Next on the agenda: Infastructure
20,1,2,Has anybody else noticed the wall painting is a bit askew?
18,3,0,Our new Company Weight Management Program will commence on Monday.
18,1,0,May I take it we are inclined to disagree?
20,3,1,While I understand that my predecessor was fond of the so-called roundtable discussion . . .
18,0,0,Does this company stink or is it just me?
19,1,0,Last one in the back seat's a monkey
18,1,0,Having spent time there I can say with confidence this Zika thing is over blown
20,2,1,I just don't understand why you can't see things from my angle?
19,1,1,I hereby call to order this evening's board meeting of Seesaws R Us
18,2,0,"As a matter of fact, James Cameron did help design this conference room."
18,1,0,"In case it's not OBVIOUS to everyone, it's all downhill from here!"
19,4,1,"you do know that ""cooties"" don't really exist right?"
16,3,0,I've been hearing complaints about work life balance.
17,3,0,Note the illusion of revenue growth.
18,2,0,"Okay, I won that round. Now, get back up here and we'll go again."
18,3,0,Now I'm going to state my inclination: I say hang on tight until a final decision is made. What is your opinion?
18,1,0,We like to support local farmers. And by local I mean within the same galaxy.
17,3,0,We're here to implement a paradigm shift in our business model.
19,4,1,"Perhaps you all were right, wheels were a bad idea."
17,1,0,"As you can see, I have a big ego."
19,9,2,I don't roll that way
19,5,1,So much for your office coup.
18,2,0,"As CEO, my vote is always the determining one."
17,1,0,My father always taught me to let gravity work for me.
18,1,1,You're safe with us. Our planet doesn't even allow seed patents.
18,1,1,"You know what they say about big halos, right?"
18,0,0,We also want everyone's input on the new mission statement...
21,2,2,We have to strike a balance.
17,0,0,"I may be chairman of this employee grievances committee, but don't you think for a moment that I'm not in your corner."
20,2,1,Privileged? My grandfather EARNED my father's RIGHT to put me here.
18,1,0,Then it's agreed: we're in a downturn.
20,4,2,I am inclined to tell you some bad news.
20,3,1,Level playing field? I think not!
20,5,1,I told you the last time we needed a different perspective.
20,4,0,I'm sensing a shift in the balance of opinion
17,1,0,You are all being dramatic. So I had some tuna for lunch. Big deal!
18,0,1,Welcome to the leaning tower of insurance
20,5,0,"As you have all probably guessed, our sales are on a decline."
17,3,0,"At this point in our discussion, your obsession with unity has cost you the high ground."
18,1,0,I can't overstate the Titanic analogy.
19,0,1,There's a shortage of lateral thinkers on this team.
21,3,2,The quick fix would be to remove the casters from each chair.
18,1,0,I called this meeting to look down on you.
18,0,1,"'Playing field' is a metaphor, people."
17,1,0,"Don't worry everyone, we're just pivoting"
18,0,0,This conference room has been engineered to optimize our participation.
18,2,0,I'm afraid the meeting is going to go downhill from here on.
20,3,1,I needn't remind you of the gravity of our situation.
20,5,2,First on the agenda is Rex who found us this great deal on a conference room!
18,1,0,I resign--this board leans too far right.
18,0,0,"I don't want to put myself above others, but here at Trump ""Level"" Architect we are looking for those who can make things straight again."
20,3,2,Look at this from my angle.
19,1,1,I don't care about the weight of evidence. We are doing it my way!
19,0,0,"Yes, now that you mention it, I suppose I could have just adjusted my chair."
20,2,1,"It's coffee breath, not the plague."
19,4,0,"Simply put, success here is an uphill climb."
19,4,1,"Due to events beyond our control, the round table discussion has been canceled."
18,1,0,What made us have this meeting on a boat?
17,2,0,The weight of opinion seems to be in favor of casual Fridays.
18,3,0,'Do any of you understand the gravity of this situation? '
19,4,2,I have good news and bad news about our artificial gravity project.

19,7,1,You have to consider the gravity of the situation.
20,5,1,Well! Looks like I get to be chairman.
17,0,0,Let's table the issue.
19,2,1,"In this focus group, we're simulating the trickle down theory."
17,2,0,We're shaking things up.
17,0,0,"Cut that out! It's not the floor, it's the frame that's crooked."
20,3,1,"Here at Acme, we save level for the playing field."
19,7,1,All in favor of NOT having the next retreat on a cruise ship...
18,1,1,"Of course, there may be those who feel our policies are slanted against a them."
21,1,2,Trump and the Republican Party
18,2,0,The NRA is willing to consider any gun reform proposals you bring to the table.
17,1,0,"The table is in my favor, if you don't vote my way I'll let go."
18,1,0,"As Chairman of the Starboard, I call this meeting to order."
18,0,0,Rumors of an infectious disease are absolutely false.
20,1,1,I'm the only left-leaning person I work with.
18,8,0,Now try to table my motion!
18,1,0,I will not agree to this settlement!
18,1,0,Top to bottom is my position on everything!
18,2,0,I have decided that your salaries as well as many other things around here will be on a sliding scale in the future.
18,6,1,"Clearly, I’ve let you down."
18,0,0,Get off your duffs and lead.
20,4,2,haha does anyone know where we got those brownies?

18,0,0,Every bounce house will need at least an additional room.
22,1,1,Welcome to Ms. White who will set us upright.
17,1,0,"An oblique angle leads to a low key, but going with the flow still produces a collective harmony."
19,7,0,Why didn't anybody bring anything to the table worth discussing?
19,5,1,"The optics may appear to be somewhat slanted, but management does not believe that the company is sinking."
18,1,0,Form followed function. This is my department now.
19,3,1,You're being rated on a sliding scale.
17,2,0,I see you've already gotten things rolling.
18,0,0,It feels as though things have been falling off a bit lately.
18,3,0,We are downsizing. Those of us still at the table get to keep our jobs.
18,1,0,"OK, here's my slant on things."
20,1,1,You are all obviously biased.
19,4,0,The next time the ship turns maybe one of you will come out on top.
18,1,0,Up until now I thought the board was tilting in my favor.
18,1,0,Now who said that we were a top heavy organization?
17,3,0,Your slant on things is not making sense.
18,3,0,It's been a see saw year for sales
17,1,0,We here at 'Teeter-totter' understand there may be a hostile take-over from See-saw Inc.
19,5,2,Today's Weight Watchers meeting has begun.

18,1,0,"All right, then, this meeting of the board of directors of American Roller Coaster is now called to order...."

19,0,1,"As a show of support, our board meetings will now mirror our earnings chart."
18,2,0,"Lean-in! Or, step-out."
17,0,0,I've changed the meaning of 'board' to 'bored'.
19,5,1,I wouldn't call it push back.
20,5,2,Let me try to straighten this all out
20,2,2,Why do I get the feeling you're not all leveling with me?
19,4,0,Uneven playing field? Baloney!
17,1,0,Let the minutes reflect that there was a slant in the room.
19,0,1,"I would like to talk about everyone's willingness to ""lean in."""
20,4,2,"My, how the tables have turned."
19,4,3,I need to keep my distance as I read the will.

19,5,1,Building Maintenance says they've fixed the whiteboards.
18,0,0,Hello....my name is E. F. Hutton......
20,2,1,I'd like to examine that from a different angle.
18,2,0,"Brussels. June 28,2016"
16,1,0,So I guess this is actual proof that those on the right are really dense.
18,6,1,"By now, the gravity of your situation should be obvious."
17,3,0,"When I said you all need to pull your weight, this is not what I meant"
18,2,0,It's just the janitor's little joke.
19,5,1,Perhaps... but the rest of the news networks are all slanted the other way.
18,0,0,"First of all, we need some perspective."
18,5,0,I think you proved my point: you're all being let go because you weigh us down.
18,3,0,We've had a rough quarter.
18,3,0,"I want to assure you, this is not a crooked operation."
19,1,1,What? Nobody ever farted in a conference room?
18,1,1,I want you all to look up to me in this time of crisis.
18,7,1,Welcome aboard.
17,0,0,"Nice try, but what you failed to realize is that this table is on casters."
21,3,2,"Despite all our efforts to level the playing field, we've decided to go the other way."
18,2,0,I suppose you're wondering why I've called this meeting of the Republican Party of the Titanic.
18,6,0,We're here to discuss a matter of the utmost gravity.
18,2,0,I thought we would all benefit from putting a new slant on things!
19,1,1,"Yes, it is lonely at the top. But not as slippery as the bottom."
18,1,0,This new law is designed to prevent voter registration fraud.
17,0,0,"C'mon ladies, just 'Lean In'."
20,3,2,The garlic naan and lamb curry were totally worth it.

18,2,0,"I told you not to build near the Tower of Pisa, even if the land was at a discount."
17,2,0,"Bob, thanks for the update, but a sinking ship is a little harsh."
17,2,0,"From my perspective, I don't see the need to level the playing filed."
18,4,0,I'm not going tot lie to you..this will be an uphill battle.
19,6,2,"So, who wants to level the playing field?"
19,4,0,I know things don't seem to be leaning my way now but you'll see!!!
18,0,0,Come on in and rest a spell.
17,2,0,But I thought my opinion weighed more than everyone else's.
19,4,0,defying gravity is just the beginning of what I can do!
17,3,0,"As the new trainees, you must understand from the get go that it flows downhill."
19,6,1,"Well, it looks like we've reached the tipping point."
18,1,0,This meeting will proceed on an even keel.
19,1,1,I'd like to place on item on the agenda for the board to discuss: we're getting consumer complaints that our construction company is not up to industry standards.
18,2,0,From my point of view its astounding.
18,1,0,I want to enlighten you about our downsizing
21,1,4,"It's over, gentlemen. I have the high ground."
17,0,0,Today we'll be discussing the pros and cons of 'global tilting'.
18,7,0,....I know things have been going down hill lately....
19,1,1,So that's seven pro-gravity and one anti-gravity.
18,2,0,Lean in.
18,3,0,Bobby get out of the room. Look at the weight limit.
18,2,0,Welcome to the annual board of directors meeting for the Tower of Pisa.
17,2,0,"There, that's how gravity works. Now, how can we profit from it?"
20,2,2,We better get paid more than the placebo group.
17,3,0,It's no coincidence that our stock is at an all-time low
20,4,2,"I know it doesn't look so great now, but I think our cruise line investments eventually will pay off."
17,3,0,I humble suggest we postpone our discussions.
19,1,1,Anyone have a mint?
18,2,0,Which grateful EU member wants to be the first to have a new British trade agreement?
19,4,1,This is the easiest way I can explain trickle down economics to you.
20,5,1,It's not going to be business as usual anymore.
18,0,0,This is what's called a power move.
19,1,0,I'm always irritated by people who imply that gravity is an escape from reality.
18,2,0,"If you make it, you'll think Sisyphus had it easy."
20,2,1,I don't care. I still have veto power.
18,2,0,I get the feeling you think my point of view is slanted.
20,7,3,I'll keep my presentation brief because I know you all hate slides.
18,1,0,So I took Sheryl Sandberg's advice.

17,2,0,I'm sick and tired of trying to 'lean in.'
20,2,1,Motion approved.
19,7,1,What will it take to bring everyone back to the table again?

19,5,1,Let's approach this issue from a new angle.
21,2,1,We are all equals at this company.
18,2,0,Looks like the presidency of Trump can only go downhill from here.
18,2,0,"As members of the Board, we must accept that things are on the downhill slope."
20,4,4,"So, now you understand the gravity of the situation."
20,4,1,I think we need to take a different slant on this.
19,3,1,How do you like it when the table's turned?
23,4,4,I think we can all appreciate the gravity of the situation.
19,5,1,I know you all probably feel like you're on a slippery slope here.
19,4,0,I see that you all understand the gravity of the situation.
19,5,0,Now that's a thought. Maybe carpeting would be the solution.
19,5,0,Didn't they tell you? This is a Trump building.
17,2,0,Earthquake smirthquake we are having a meeting.
19,2,2,I think your view is slanted. Look at it from my angle.

18,0,0,"No, no, you're hired! I said you're 'hired'!"
18,2,0,Slanted? The recession has made moving up harder on everyone.
17,3,0,Let's remember to lock the wheels before the next meeting.
19,5,1,I just want to quash the rumors that this company is a sinking ship.
17,0,0,Things are under control. We've ordered a smaller table.
21,5,3,Level floors? Level floors are for closers.
23,4,4,I get the sense that the whole room is leaning towards one decision.
19,4,1,"Henceforth, we shall look to levelling the playing field."
18,2,0,"Even though this wave shall pass, let's hold onto this symbolism."
17,3,0,I notice this focus group is a little one sided. . .
20,4,1,You're still inside the box.
17,3,0,Any objections to the sliding scale format?
18,1,1,"Cooties isn't supposed to be a thing anymore, you guys!"
19,6,1,I don't want you to think of me as your boss.
18,3,0,I'm here to give my slant on this issue.
18,0,0,"And they all moved away from me at the ""Group W"" conference table!"
21,3,2,I'm afraid I misunderstood when you said we need a new slant on the way we do our staff meetings.
18,1,1,In spite of the majority vote we will not proceed to appeal the Law of Gravity.
20,3,2,And that's why a chair needs five legs.
19,3,1,Management wants you all to have a seat at the table...
17,3,0,Brexit has turned things a bit askew.
19,2,1,Thank you for weighing in.
18,0,0,Simon says...You're fired.
17,3,0,Looks like our robot has been tinkering with the law of gravity again.
17,2,0,"All in favor of advising the shareholders that this unexpected downturn is solely due to Brexit, please raise your hands."
19,6,0,I see no problem with wheeled chairs... motion denied.
18,1,0,"Instead of PowerPoint, I thought we'd do today's presentation in Sensurround."
16,1,0,I think we've turned a corner.
19,2,1,Shall we continue discussing the potential earthquakes here in Oklahoma?
18,1,1,Don't mistake this for the moral high ground.
18,2,0,"Let's try again, no religion."
18,1,0,I will not yield to peer pressure!
19,4,1,I move we adjourn at this point and reconvene outdoors on higher ground.
18,1,0,"Red rover, red rover..."
18,0,0,He always wanted to be in a higher position than the rest of us.
17,1,0,All of you are not so much sloping downward as I am sloping upward.
17,2,0,I should have been more specific anout which company values I wanted reflected in design of the new headquarters.
18,0,0,It's going to be an uphill battle but you need to to see things from my angle.
19,4,0,"Hi, my name is Drew, and I'm a germophobe!"
20,4,2,These meetings always seem to go downhill.

19,0,1,I now call to order this inaugural meeting of the Gravity Hills Club.
18,5,0,"On the motion, starboard prevails."
22,4,5,"Oh my God, it does not smell that bad."
17,2,0,Next thing will be a vacuum
20,2,1,"Wait? You rookies didn't eat the evidence brownies that were on this table, did you?"
19,5,0,Well maybe a little seasickness is just what this company needs.
18,0,0,"On the matter of my remaining as your CEO, the 'nays' appears to be unanoymous."
19,2,0,I'm voting for Trump and that's it.
18,4,1,Today we will discuss the balance of power in our organization.
18,4,0,As you can see we expect our summer interns to claw their way to the top like everybody else here.
19,4,0,"As you can see, the cream usually rises to the top."
17,0,0,Welcome to our first meeting about changing our cafeteria menu.
19,4,1,This project is going downhill.
19,5,1,Did the earth move for you too?
17,1,0,I learned this new slant on things at Trump University.
21,4,3,It's a unanimous vote for vertical window blinds.
20,2,1,I will not let this company slide into bankruptcy.
19,1,0,"As your newly-elected President, I'd like to begin by thanking you for your steadfast support of The Flat Earth Society."
19,6,0,We need to start looking at this from a new angle.
17,1,0,Let's take another look at our balance sheet.
18,1,0,"Ignore this California weather, who's presenting first?"
19,4,0,What did you think of the earthquake simulator?
17,2,0,Our magazine has been falsely accused of slanting the news.
18,4,0,I spoke with the board. We're going in another direction.
18,1,0,Well you don't see me asking about the room. And that's why I'm at the head of the table.
16,0,1,"Obviously, our outlooks are slanted on this project!"
18,0,0,Let's not have a slanted perception here.
18,1,0,Our poison pill required adopting Tangential Dynamics
18,1,0,"Now, everyone in favor of electing our first female CEO just roll on up to my end of the desk."

20,1,2,You are here so that together we can face a change of seismic proportions!
18,1,0,Again: Please provide your balanced feedback.
18,1,0,"Okay, really, who feels up to the job?"
19,6,0,"No, we don't lead through consensus at Teeter-Totter, Inc."
18,1,0,"Johnson, either come sit next to me, or at least cut out the 2nd 'Egg McMuffin' every morning."
19,1,1,"It's halitosis, it's really no big deal."
19,5,1,What do you mean 'level playing field?'
20,3,1,I get the sense we don't see eye to eye on this.
18,0,0,I guarantee there will be no slippery slope of over-commitment on my watch.
17,1,0,"Henry, I like getting your slant on things, but, this is ridiculous."
19,5,0,Remember what I told you about your jobs & that slippery slope!!
18,1,0,"Was my halitosis worth sitting on the far side now? I think not, considering four of you get seasick. None of you are welcome over here."
17,3,0,I'll concede; that question was a bit weighted.
20,2,1,Maybe we should stop meeting after eating lunch.
20,4,1,You might think I have a slanted view on this issue.
18,1,0,"Unlike you folks, the table is secured!!"
19,3,1,I need to level with you all.

18,0,0,I didn't think this was a junior high dance!
20,3,2,There's been a shift in our corporate structure.
18,3,0,"Can someone explain to me what all this ""level playing field"" fuss is about?"

19,2,1,"Clearly, we have to turn this ship around."
20,2,1,We need to change our company name from On-the-Level Building Contractors.
23,4,5,Maybe I came on a little strong there.

17,1,0,Herd mentality rocks Dave's world.
20,4,1,"As you can see, we are currently experiencing a down side in the cruise line industry."
18,2,0,"I thought the company wanted a leader with gravitas, but if you prefer gravity, fine."
17,3,0,Which one of you touched my frame?
18,1,0,"Hello, welcome to ""The Inner Mind of Google""; I'm your guide, M- Hold on, somebody just typed ""Barrel Roll""."
18,1,0,It's clear the motion is no longer on the table.
20,2,2,The first one to compare this downturn to the Titanic is fired.
22,4,4,You've all been hired to right this ship.
19,2,2,Let's do a roll call vote instead.
20,7,2,Hopefully you all now see the gravity of the situation.
17,3,0,The playing field is(italics) level.
18,4,2,"Come on people, it's an optical illusion."
18,1,0,"Great job on the playing field, everyone. Now let's work on the conference room."
18,0,0,As you can see we have had to re-scale some of our business.
18,3,0,How many more studies of global leaning do you people need?
20,1,1,"Will the Annual Shareholders Meeting of 'Pisa Pies, Inc.' please come to order?"
18,0,0,Why would anyone say I have a condescending attitude?
19,2,1,I think I've figured out how to level out our declining stock price.
19,2,0,"Since I can't hear any objections, the motion is passed."
19,1,1,"Come back to the table, my liking of Trump is not contagious."
18,3,0,Time to right the corporate ship.
18,1,0,"And so, in conclusion, I hope you'll all join me in making a significant contribution to the Trump For President Campaign."
18,1,0,"As our stocks sink, any resemblance to the Titanic is purely intentional."
17,3,0,"Yes Jim, you're right. The artwork is still level. And that is why our self-leveling frames will revolutionize cruise ship decorating!"
18,2,0,"""As you know, it's all down hill from here!"
20,6,3,It seems your opinion outweighs my logic.
20,2,2,"Okay, so how are we going to spin this? Ideas?"
17,2,0,I think things are really looking up.
18,1,0,As your team leader I can assure you that we are all on a level playing field here.
17,3,0,"What do mean, things have tilted in my favor??"
17,3,0,"Tilt the room all you want, I'm still the decider."
17,3,0,Now this is what I call uneven representation!
18,0,0,"Rest assured, this sinkhole incident doesn't impact my view of you as subordinates."
19,5,1,I didn't say Simon says.
17,0,0,"I swear it wasn't me, that was just the sound of the building settling!"
20,3,3,Management has decided not to level the playing field at this time.
18,6,1,"Nonsense. If the boat were sinking, I would have been airlifted out by now."
18,2,0,Any attempt to climb your way to the top may be hampered by an uneven playing field.
17,0,0,It's not my fault that you all have wheels on your chairs.
20,4,1,Seems like there might be an issue with the balance sheet.
18,1,1,I told you the new board room would get things rolling!
18,1,0,"Can we all refrain from saying,""It's like moving the deck chairs around on the Titanic."""
19,5,0,I just wanted to give you a heads up
18,6,1,"Welcome to Sisyphus, Inc. Please gather around the table."
18,2,0,Guess we won't need the Ouija board to divine the selection of CEO.
16,0,0,I know builder had a few problems but we went with the low bid
18,1,0,"A tough subject, I know, but have I lost you?"
18,0,0,"I told you the new board room would get things rolling, hah!"
17,0,0,I take it that you want a corner on this market?
18,0,0,"Back away from my positions all you want, but I am the nominee."
19,3,1,"According to my calculations, every facet of our business is in decline."
20,3,1,This chapter's annual meeting of the Flat Earth Society is called to order. Is there any old business?
19,5,1,"And THAT, ladies and gentlemen, is why in California we bolt the tables to the floors."
18,0,0,"OK, who stuck their chewing gum under the table legs?"
20,3,1,I'll promote anyone who swings the vote my way.
17,0,0,I want to make sure this report takes the appropriate slant.
20,1,2,"So, can I take that as a 'yes?"
17,2,0,"Come on everyone, roll up a chair."
18,1,0,"His 'My door is always open' policy turns one-sided, eh?"
19,0,0,Who moved my chaise?
21,3,3,"Ok, I promise, I'll never reference "" the Donald"" again"
19,5,1,So somebody tell me why you all think we've tilted too far to the right.
18,3,0,"So, here's our angle."
18,3,0,The quarterly report shows us against the wall...Am I the only one carrying his weight?
21,2,2,This was cheaper than getting all of you shorter chairs.
17,7,0,We've taken some extraordinary measures to level that picture frame.
18,0,0,"I could let the ayes have it, indeed!"
19,3,0,Will someone please straighten the picture frame?
19,4,1,I don't have to tell you it's been a lean year for the foundation.
19,2,0,Jeremy liked to address his managers from a position of authority.
17,3,0,"OK, who drew the rectangle?"
18,1,0,"And lastly, all in favor of booking a room at the Pantheon for our next meeting say Aye."
18,1,1,This meeting has reached a tipping point
19,0,1,"You're right, I would rather get an anal probe than decide between Trump or Hillary."
18,3,0,"Our company was started with a shaky foundation, so this is no surprise."
18,3,0,Corporate has requested a shift in perspective.
19,3,1,I guess I don't have to tell you-the company is sinking fast.
20,3,1,It took a delivery of rolling swivel chairs to finally settle the debate over whether or not it was the window that was crooked.
20,1,2,"First, we must right the ship!"
23,2,6,It appears the balance of power has shifted.
17,0,0,Okay! We're on a roll!
18,3,0,you all are aware that it's a tough climb to the top
20,5,0,The odds are in your favor.
17,0,0,"This is the final session of Trump University series ""Staying on top of the Deal""."
20,2,1,I bet now you'll stop asking why I always sit on this end.
18,0,0,I'm not so sure that green lighting a sequel to 'Gravity' is a good idea.
19,3,1,"Okay, now that we've agreed on your concerns, can we get to mine?"
17,3,0,I'm afraid I had too many martinis for lunch.
18,1,0,"If anyone still feels I'm heading in the wrong direction on this one, please just level with me now... before collectively rushing madly off in all directions!"
20,2,1,It's a slippery slope people.
19,4,1,I'm inclined to agree with you.
18,0,1,"Really guys, I'm not the one who tilted the whiteboard."
21,2,2,What's a Richter scale?
20,1,1,It appears this conversation is moving in your direction.
18,1,0,"From your perspective, do think the picture is level...?"
17,0,0,The See-Saw architecture firm will not be rehired in the future.
17,0,0,"I already feel like part of the team, here at Bunch Social Media."
19,3,0,Will those passengers with the last remaining ticket on the lifeboat please move to this end of the prominade deck
20,5,1,This meeting seems to be going downhill.
18,3,0,"All those who think we should get rid of the wheels on the chairs say ""aye."""
18,3,0,Business is a slippery slope.
18,1,0,I hope you feel comfortable. Let me know if you need something.
18,1,1,"Alright, whose bright idea to have this years board meeting on a sailboat?"
19,3,1,I would like to commend the Whiteboard Leveling Committee on their tremendous achievement.
17,0,0,The positive takeaways from this meeting are: the window was installed on the wall to my left and the table is fastened to the floor.
17,3,0,"Admittedly, things appear slightly skewed toward management."
18,1,0,"And finally, forget about rolling with the punches."
20,4,2,Our sales department has really gone downhill.

19,0,1,I don't care that we're falling. So are our sales.
17,0,0,You nay sayers aren't bringing me down today
18,0,0,"So, I gather we're all in agreement with my opinion."
18,0,0,"With insouciance, I no longer wish to niggle nor hector but rather I reprobate your foppish desideratum with schadenfreude."
18,1,0,"Don't be discouraged, this is just the downside of my presentation."
17,0,0,"Now that we're seated, I want to open the floor to new ideas..."
23,8,6,Now...Let's see what this button does.
18,2,0,"When you learn not to rock the boat, you can sit at the table."
19,4,2,"A simple ""nay"" will do next time, folks."
19,1,1,Let me give you my slant on the matter.
21,3,2,We believe it's a temporary market shift.
20,5,3,Alright. Who moved the white board?
18,0,1,I've got gravity on my side.
21,3,3,Let's roll.
19,1,0,"Bottom line is down, I deserve the raise!"
18,3,0,I guess I don't need to tell you--there's been a slight downturn.
20,3,2,"In hindsight, we should have just re-framed the window."
17,2,0,"As your can see, the stock performance chart looks much better from your angle."
17,2,0,Your next moves are going to be uphill.
19,5,1,Cheapest office space in all of Pisa. and this board room is huge!
21,1,2,And again this year I recommend we budget for chairs without wheels.
18,1,0,"Frankly, as Champion Skateboard spokespersons, we expected more from you."
18,3,0,I'd like to make a motion.
18,0,0,I'd like to start off by giving you my slant on things.
17,1,0,Are we leaning towards yes on that new account?
17,2,0,"Bill, I would like you to spearhead arrangement of the deck chairs. Liz, please organize and cue the string quartet."
18,3,0,Perhaps I'm offering a slanted opinion.
17,3,0,Corporate thinks we're backsliding.
21,5,3,I just don't think you understand the gravity of the situation!
19,0,1,I wanted the right balance on the team.
18,1,0,Wall Street is experiencing a slight correction.
20,3,1,Don't complain... Ernie Kovacs often used this table!
18,2,0,Great meeting! So we can conclude that excrement flows downhill in this company.
18,0,0,"C'mon folks! We work in finance, you've got to roll with the ups and downs."
18,2,0,Even flat organizations have to pivot from time to time. Ours was at the midpoint.
17,0,0,"you asked for equality in the workplace, you got it!"
18,5,1,I sense the board is already leaning one way on this issue.
20,5,1,I believe we need to fire the architect.
21,3,1,There's no easy way to say it: We're fighting an uphill battle.
17,1,0,I assure you that the ship is not sinking so please return to your stations.
18,4,0,Is it my halitosis?
17,1,0,"Need I say, we start this project not on a level playing field."
22,0,3,Does removing the casters deal with the symptom and not address the problem?
19,1,1,I thought it only fair to level the playing field.
17,1,0,As you can see there is a downside to a hands free approach.
18,3,0,"As you know, we charge our clients on a sliding scale."

20,3,2,We need to talk about today's orientation.
20,2,1,I need at least three volunteers.
20,4,1,I'll be honest - things are not looking up.
21,5,3,Looks like the nays have it.
19,0,0,I wasn't expecting a white board.
18,0,1,It's time for Table Bowling.
17,2,0,"Apparently you all have sided with Martha. But, before we vote, if I let go of this table there is no Martha!"
18,3,0,I don't give a damn who tilted the room--who oiled the rollers?
19,0,0,Time to rearrange the deck chairs.
19,3,2,Good Job People! It's all down hill from here!
20,4,1,It looks like you already know why I've called you all here.
18,2,0,Now that I've got your attention...
19,1,1,I want to welcome everyone to the first meeting of our conference here on the beutiful HMS Titanic...
20,2,2,Good news! The breaks for your chairs are on the truck!
20,2,3,"Mr. Cameron, we're just a bit confused about what the plot of the sequel would be."
19,4,2,"If I hear level playing field once more, I will not be amused."
21,3,2,"Actually, it's the camera and the window that's slanted."
19,4,0,I've always wanted to be looked up to.
18,7,0,please set your wheels to the lock position
18,6,0,You may have read about the shift in our corporate culture...

14,4,0,The company has reached a tipping point.
18,3,0,How about this for a balance of power?

20,3,1,The first thing you need to know about me is that I don't believe in level playing fields.
19,4,2,"As you may have noticed, our company has gone downhill."
19,1,1,The tables have turned. My raise or I let go.
20,3,2,One false move and I'll let go of the table
18,3,0,Seriously guys? I swear there was no gluten in my bagel this morning.
20,3,1,This will be the last company retreat we have on a yacht.
18,7,2,Why don't we try another angle?
22,1,3,"As your new superior, it is necessary that you start looking up to me."
18,1,0,"Ladies and gentleman, the balance of power has shifted."
18,4,0,OK ... I'm going to level with you.
18,0,0,"This may not look like King Arthur's Roundtable, but for our purposes it obviously is."

18,2,0,If you have any questions do not write them on the wall.

19,0,1,Management now has the upper hand and we are initiating the following new work rules:
17,2,0,The alternative was to stay in the older building.
20,0,2,We will be meeting like this until flu season is over.

19,1,1,Things are a bit rocky here at the moment.
18,1,0,"Well, with the right perspective..."
20,4,2,I'm sensing a bias...
18,4,0,"This is called ""leverage"" in the boardroom. Now cast your vote."
18,3,0,"""Level playing field??"" That's never really been a part of the organization's vision."
20,4,0,We've found that our funhouse concept increases productivity.

18,5,0,"From where I'm sitting, things are looking up."
20,3,2,It's just an illusion.
18,0,0,I'd like to take all my marbles and go home. Please.
17,2,0,We need to look at this from a fresh angle.
17,1,0,I warned you this was a slippery slope.
18,2,0,It has been a long downhill slide but I still hate to see you go.
20,2,2,"Remember, the money saved buying swamp land paid your bonuses this year."
18,2,0,Can someone hand me a pen ?
19,4,0,I guess you know the company has been going downhill.
17,1,0,"So if there are no other questions, thank you Ladies and Gentlemen for your time and for your participation on this focus group ""Titanic: The Ride""."
20,3,1,This is why I sit at the head of the table.
17,0,0,Just kidding ... I did use deodorant this morning!
20,3,2,I wish you would level with me.
21,3,2,Which one of you had the idea to meet on a cruise ship?
18,2,0,Was it something I built?
18,2,0,I have just one more point I want to slip by you.
22,4,4,"First, let me welcome you all to Pisa."
21,2,2,I hope you all realize the gravity of this situation.
20,3,2,Fair enough. But you can't beat the rent on this place!
17,3,0,Try putting velcro on the bottom of your wheels like I do.

18,1,1,Have we really stooped to a new level?
19,1,1,I want to welcome you all to this first Board meeting of the Titanic Association.
19,4,2,This Board must recognize its position relative to the Chairman.
22,8,5,The rumors are true. We are a sinking ship.
20,2,2,Next on the agenda is how will the company's profitability be influenced by the tilt of the earth's axis.
17,1,0,The sway is even worse on the top floor.
19,1,1,The motion to table loses.
17,0,0,"After the course, you are assured to make a lot of money especially in real estate deals."
17,1,0,It slants downward by design
19,4,0,Why is the white board crooked?
19,6,1,Would one of you straighten the whiteboard?
18,0,0,"If there is no further discussion, I call the question of tabling the motion."
19,4,1,"You recognize, it's only by mere geological accident that I'm talking down to you."
18,3,0,"I hope you'll note that our ""continued investment in foundational integrity"", as mentioned in the training video, was figurative."
18,2,0,"I'm not sure I understand what you mean by ""culture"" of income inequality..."
19,4,0,Our core competence is creating level playing fields in corporate situations.
19,4,1,What makes you think I'm slanting the news?
21,3,2,"Okay, I'm gonna let go now. Watch me. Watch me, guys. It's gonna be awesome. Brad you aren't looking."
19,3,1,Today we are embarking on a titanic enterprise .
20,5,1,I am tired of hearing people say the company's going downhill.
20,4,2,I am strongly reconsidering our ability to be fair and balanced.
19,1,1,"As you can see, sitting at the head of the table is only one tactic for taking charge of a meeting."

19,2,0,"It's not use, you're fighting an uphill battle"
18,1,1,The Earthquake Prevention Committee will now come to order.
19,1,1,"I think this initial employee engagement training session has gone quite well, don't you?"
17,0,0,We like our interns to start at the bottom and work their way up
20,2,1,"My sincerest apologies for the delay, but it's better late than never to conduct an earthquake training, right?"
18,0,1,All those in favor of leasing office space at a non-M.C. Escher-designed building during the next fiscal year?
18,0,0,"I didn't get up here by going with the flow, who wants this now?"""
18,1,0,"""It has been moved and seconded that we all sing ""Nearer my God to thee""."

20,2,2,I am finally beginning to appreciate the gravity of the situation.
17,2,0,Today's meeting of the Titanic Inquest Board shall come to order.
18,1,0,I'm afraid a new office is off the table.
20,5,1,"""We share this floor with ""Weight Watchers""."
17,1,0,"Hey, when this company goes on tilt it really goes on tilt."

19,1,1,Ok! I herd you!
18,1,0,"All for one, and ONE for all!"
19,5,1,I’m going to level with you.
18,5,0,"No Bob, I still don't know why the TV isn't tilted."
19,7,1,Good thing the table is not on wheels.
18,0,0,The ground swell is against us. The gravity of the situation is apparent. The playing field is not level. We MUST respond full tilt!
18,2,0,"Come on guys, is there someone here who can give me a two point perspective on this situation."
18,0,0,This adds a whole new slant to my proposal
24,8,7,I don't think you understand the gravity of the situation.
18,1,0,We were hoping for a fresh response to our crooked mirror exercise.
19,0,1,"So, you think I should give up bicycle commuting for the summer?"
20,3,2,Can we get some interns to starboard for ballast?

17,0,0,You live that shall cry woe for this hereafter.
18,3,0,Looks like the table have turned.
17,2,0,That's just the way we roll around here.
18,3,0,I appreciate your calm as we work to right our organization.
17,1,0,Who's complaining about a glass ceiling?
18,0,0,Can I be honest? I'm not feeling this interview.
20,2,1,Before we begin does anyone want coffee?
21,3,2,This chair will oppose any unanimous descent until the table is motioned!
18,3,0,"All right, then. All those in favor..."
19,4,1,Angle? What angle? I don't have any angle.
18,0,0,"Thanks again. We're fanatic about ""locally sourced."""
20,1,2,And that's why I'm up here and you're down there.
19,3,1,I call to order the Titanic board of directors meeting.
18,1,0,"OK, Chester, let's hear your slant on this."
18,1,0,I'm counting on all of you to help me balance the company product line.
21,3,3,I'm sorry but the lifeboats only have room for the CEO's.
19,4,1,...And now I wish to speak to you about a matter of some gravity...
19,1,1,"So, we are all in agreement that it would not be a good idea to change the name to BIGYBIGYBOATFACE, and we stay with Titanic. Shall we adjourn for tea?"
17,0,0,I hate Downward Trend discussions. You won't notice anyway.
19,4,1,And over there is the Empire State Building. Say... does that look lopsided at all to any of you?
18,1,0,"You will have to admit,this is a topsy-turvy world!!"
18,1,0,Let me explain the angle of repose.
21,3,2,"Except for the occasional earthquake, I think you will enjoy living here in California."

19,4,0,"Good, now that I have you all together."
17,0,0,“How are you guys liking this contemporary slanted floor Frank Gehry-inspired architecture for our new boardroom?” Says an in-denial narcissistic boss.

18,2,1,Am I the only here who thinks we've lost our perspective?
19,1,1,I feel your view of this proposal is somewhat slanted.
17,0,0,Now that I'm president I'm going to make the room straight again.
18,0,0,"At Maplewood Lanes, there are bowling advancement opportunities available, if you work hard and apply yourself."

18,2,0,The tabled issue is now tilted in my favor
19,0,1,Sorry. This room used to belong to Trump.
20,2,2,Have I made my position clear enough?
18,1,0,I just have a different slant on things.
18,1,0,"And now, my personal thought on where the company is headed"
18,1,0,"Okay group, and what is your slant on life?"

18,3,0,"I'm hearing words like slump, downward trends and market collapse, but seeing none of it."
19,0,1,Management has asked me to come clean about something. We all work in a yellow submarine.
21,1,2,Hands up who still fails to grasp the gravity of our situation.
17,3,1,I just want to give you my slant on things.
20,8,2,The market slide was more severe than we had anticipated
18,0,0,"You know you make-a-me work so hard, that you gimme no. Oh baby please give a little respect to me."
18,0,0,"Okay, folks! This is the playing field, you're not Bernie Sanders and I'm not Elizabeth Warren!"
18,2,0,"The key is putting paper clips in the rollers; oh yes, and hiring an architect who does not drink."
19,10,1,This company is moving in a new direction.
21,4,4,There's been a seismic shift in our firm's outlook.
20,4,1,I'm inclined to agree with you. You've put a whole new slant on it.
18,7,1,I see that it's going to be an uphill battle to get you on my side.
18,2,0,"Ah. But you see, I have RIGHT on my side."
16,0,0,"""Good morning, board members; I have bad news"" (let the sign above table show a graph with a sharp decline to the bottom right corner."
19,0,1,Does this have anything to do with the group snapchat I sent last night?
18,2,0,Chair thanks engineering for putting the wheels of this committee in motion.
17,1,0,"Well, that's my slant on things."
18,2,0,Any more questions about why the board meeting was moved to Pisa?
18,0,0,"I'm just going to say one word to you: ""Gravity."" There's a great future in gravity."
20,2,2,"We have a problem, and I know you'd all appreciate some straight talk."
18,2,0,"Ok. Much like the Brexit vote, if you decide to really leave, you can't come back."
19,1,1,It appears as though the Ayes have it.
19,4,0,I regret to inform you people will be let go using sliding scale.
20,3,2,You all seriously need to lean-in.
20,2,1,I take it this isn't a hostile takeover?
19,3,0,You have to see it from my angle.
18,3,0,Try to see it my way.
17,3,0,I hope you all now see the gravity of this situation.

18,6,0,Rigged? What makes you think the system is rigged?
20,4,2,Th markets have shifted.
22,6,6,"Unless I get a volunteer, I’m going to let go of this table."

18,1,1,We need to address this issue of boardroom bias.
17,0,0,So... I may not have exactly leveled with all of you.
18,3,0,I propose we order more water glasses and place the casters on lock.
16,3,0,Welcome to a meeting of the pro-gravity association!

20,9,2,Anyone see my pen down there?
17,3,0,"Once the Brexit settles in, the markets should level off again."
20,4,0,Guess it's time to lean in.

21,3,2,Of course what you have to say matters.
18,1,0,"As you probably already have surmised, we will be discussing Stegner's Angle of Repose today."
18,1,0,"Now, to new business -- ""chair brakes."""
18,2,0,I accept payment by sliding scale

18,3,0,We're obviously top heavy in management.
20,4,2,I called this meeting today because I felt I should just level with you.
17,2,0,You guys seem like you're really on a roll.
17,0,0,It worked so well with ping-pong I thought I'd give it a try as a business strategy.
19,4,1,"Obviously, chairs with wheels don't work well with our architectural style."

18,2,0,That's my slant.
18,5,0,Why won't you believe that Management is on your side?
20,4,1,So the balance of power shifts.
18,3,0,"All in favour of abandoning ship, raise your hands."
17,2,0,"Dammit...I told you, ""UP and to the right!"""

16,2,0,And all along you thought it was the ceiling!
18,3,0,"Ok, so maybe it was a bad idea to hold our board meeting on the Titanic this year."
19,1,1,This is not what I meant when I said we needed to downsize.
17,3,0,"So, offshoring doesn't mean moving to a boat?"
18,6,1,"Trust me, you'll see it differently when we list to port."
20,2,3,Will somebody straighten the damn picture.
18,0,0,It's the new floating floor.
17,0,0,I am a very insecure man.
19,4,0,I still expect a balanced vote on this.
18,1,0,This will be a working lunch -- for me.
14,2,1,I'm sure you're wondering why I've clumped you all together.
20,4,1,This shift in policy will feel like a slippery slope for some of you.
20,6,3,It seems the builder didn't level with us.
19,0,1,The new management has a Trickle Down Philosophy
18,3,0,"If you want a seat at the table, you'll roll my way!"
19,4,1,I have a vague sense that I may not have the Board's full support on this one.

18,0,0,I feel alone in views
18,0,0,"Due to several complaints from women about a lack of opportunity in our company, I've made some adjustments to foster more ""lean in moments."""

20,1,2,I don't like the slant on this project.
22,1,3,"People, the ship is sinking...."
18,7,0,You may have noticed a shift in management recently.
20,7,2,Tell me why I shouldn't just let go of this table.
18,1,0,"As your President, my primary goal has to bring much-needed balance and order to our Company."
18,3,0,"With heavy hearts, we regret to inform you that you have been let go."
21,3,2,Let's be careful how we spin this.
20,3,1,So the resolution is passed... No more Board meetings on the Titanic
19,0,1,"I have heard your complaints about, ""inequalities in the office"" and I'd like to say that you seem no different to me now then before."
16,2,0,"OK, what's your angle?"
17,2,0,"No,No,No,it's just a fundamental market shift."
18,2,0,The company's been on a downward slope.
17,1,1,I guess I just don't see the gravity of the situation.
19,5,0,I'm going to let go of the table now.
19,3,1,"Alright, on three i'm gonna let go!"
19,6,1,Your performance was based on a sliding scale
21,3,4,All I'm asking is for you to look at it from my angle.
18,1,0,Looks like the crooked man who built the crooked house is working at his office!
20,4,1,Stop rocking the boat.
22,7,4,I'm here to assure you that fracking does not cause seismic events.
15,1,1,SILENT MAJORITIES CAN CARRY LOTS OF WEIGHT
18,3,1,"Yes, if I'm so inclined."
20,2,2,I hope you don't box yourselves into a corner during these negotations.
20,2,2,It takes bold leadership to admit that the wheeled chairs were a mistake.
18,1,0,Today in Physics 1 we will study the properties of the inclined plane.
17,3,0,"Don't panic, it's just an optical illusion."

20,8,2,"Alright, second my motion, or I let the table go."
18,3,0,"From now on , this is the way we roll ."
18,0,0,"""Well, I guess you've wondered why I called you all here today, haven't you? I'm Gort, your interplanetary tour guide. That sounds better than abduction, doesn't it? Damn, there goes that plane-stabilization again!"
19,0,0,"Ah, so they haven't put bubblegum on your chair yet."
20,4,1,Sorry...beans for lunch.
22,1,3,"For obvious reasons, the company will no longer be providing free lunches."
18,1,1,Are you sure you want me to table this discussion?
18,2,0,You're all fired!
19,4,1,Is anyone still not clear that we operate on a sliding scale?
20,3,1,"As I tried to explain, the company is at sea."
19,6,1,I'm slowly coming around to the idea that the business is reaching a tipping point.
18,1,0,The odds seem to be tipped in your favor.
19,0,1,You may have noticed there is no level playing field in our organization.
20,3,2,"When I said we had to get lean, I didn't mean this."
18,1,1,We must address the criticism that we are slanted to the right.
17,3,0,I was thinking more along the lines of a happy hour or a ropes course
21,8,1,This is exactly what I meant when I said we have to level the field.
19,0,1,...and the flatulence goes away in about 10 days.
20,1,2,I don't want you to think this meeting is slanted in any way shope or form
18,2,0,Let's not hold the next board meeting on a cruise ship.
19,2,0,You see a slope. I see a new angle where the strong can grab hold. Welcome to the GRABTOCRACY!
18,3,1,"When I say ""ramp up"", I mean it."
19,3,0,There's a locking mechanism on each of the wheels.
19,7,0,We are here to debate whether fracking is or is not a problem. Is there a motion from the floor?
17,3,0,Our new seating is based off of the revised org chart.
21,3,2,Congratulations to all for this landslide victory.
19,3,3,"Yup, Fred Astaire used the same room."
19,0,0,"For once, if you can all, and especially the women, just lean in!"
19,5,1,"Look, team, Brexit has been rough on everyone. But let's just try and make the best of our relocation to Pisa."
18,3,0,"Let's put a pin in ""leveling the playing field."" What's next on your agenda?"
20,2,1,"Now, the key to business is getting a seat at the table."
18,5,0,"Before we vote, I'd like to remind you that I am holding the table."
21,3,3,"Two reasons really: one, because I am a germ phobe and two, because your silly opinions mean nothing to me."
19,1,1,One of these days we're going to balance the debt.
18,3,0,"Good afternoon. I'm from HR. The ship is listing. You are all fired. As part of your package, you will receive swimming lessons this evening."
18,0,0,"Ok, abut let me clarify what I meant by ""making a list."""
19,0,1,Sorry to keep you all weighting.
19,9,2,Another uphill battle?
18,0,0,"Ok, that's seven yes and one no for a slanted viewpoint."
18,0,0,It's not true that this company is sinking faster than The Titanic
18,3,0,I realize things may look different to you from your perspective.
19,1,0,"I underestimated the gravity of ""extreme right."""
18,5,0,Negotiating 101: tilt the odds in your favor.
18,0,0,"Something's right winged with the world today but everyone thinks it's acute! Ah, yet it is all a matter of perspective. ...."
16,3,0,The market crash is hitting us hard this quarter.
18,3,0,You all wanted a seat at the table. Here's your chance.
19,4,2,Now I see the gravity of our situation.
18,3,0,"No, Maureen... gravity is NOT an excuse."
16,0,0,And you thought Steve's ideas were slanted...
17,0,0,"Thank you for your interest, but we're looking for candidates with more hands-on experience."
20,2,2,Ceci n'est pas une optical illusion
18,0,0,"Say ""calf rope."""
19,5,0,Our sales are down slightly this quarter.
18,8,0,Our architect studied in Pisa.
19,1,1,...and all those voting to continue funding of Cristo's installation join me at this end of the table.
18,2,0,This meeting room is normally used by the Pablo Picasso study group.
18,0,0,There’s no excuse for not getting a seat at the table.
19,7,1,Who said anything about an even playing field?
19,0,1,Talk about imbalance of power.
17,0,0,"""C'mon, being the head of the US Immigration and Naturalization Service will be a really, really beautiful and unbelievable job""."
17,1,0,"Listen, I told you all the see-saw office design was a bad idea."
20,3,1,"I assure you, we're working on it."
17,4,0,All in favor of a level playing field-can I get a show of hands?
18,1,1,And this is why you claim it's so hard to balance the budget?
18,2,0,I know I am thinking outside the box.
17,0,0,It's a sliding scale approach.
17,2,0,Now the most important thing is we all need to work together as a team.
21,2,3,Don’t let the gravity of the situation impact your board vote.
18,2,0,"To a degree, it is impossible to bring everyone together at the same table!!"
18,0,0,"well, then, have it your way"
18,3,0,You are probably wondering why I called you there.
17,8,0,I can see you all understand the gravity of the situation.
21,1,2,I suppose you're wondering why I've gathered you all there today...
18,3,0,The time has come for me to level with you.
18,0,0,"We can be a top selling sales group, but stop being so selfish. I didn't say selfie!"
21,3,3,"All in favor of not renewing the lease say ""I""."
18,0,0,"I'm the good cop, you don't want to meet the bad one"
20,3,1,This is the last year we hold the meeting in Pisa.
19,1,1,Perhaps you do understand the gravity of the situation.
19,0,1,"Past performance may not guarantee future results, but in this case, it's a pretty good predictor."
20,1,1,I am feeling a shift in the market.
18,3,0,And what else rolls downhill?
18,6,0,OK. I can see which way your vote is leaning.
19,0,0,"So, what do you think will make you stand out most?"
19,6,1,"As your CEO, I know you look up to me for a new slant on how to address our decline in business."
19,1,1,"When I said we should have weighted voting on the measure, I meant it literally."
17,2,0,"As you may have surmised, teeter-totter sales are down this quarter."
18,2,0,Oops!!! Looks like the Dow just took a downturn...
21,10,5,"As you may have guessed, I've highly leveraged the company."
17,2,0,I have a different perspective.
19,4,1,"I am sorry to say, corporate called and they're closing the Pisa office."
18,2,0,Let me fill you in on our new offshore operation.
19,1,1,"Oh, please... don't tell me you haven't heard of the architect Calatrava?!"

17,1,0,"Clearly, plummeting stock prices have affected the company."
19,6,1,"I can have the wheels removed from your chairs, but that's all!"
18,0,0,Thank you for that resounding vote of confidence.
18,1,1,Welcome to your first private tutorial at Trump U.
18,3,0,Perhaps you are all wondering why I gathered you ... um in that corner today.
21,2,2,"Just so you know, naughty corners have been shown to improve efficiency by a full percentile."
17,3,0,"C'mon, folks! Haven't you ever seen a crooked wall chart?"
21,2,2,Fine. I'LL straighten the picture frame.
20,2,1,"So, what's your angle on this?"
21,2,4,Any suggestions on how to level the playing field?
18,1,0,"So, the Brits are out of the EU, and the whole universe is now a different place."
19,4,2,"Cheerio, EU!"
18,1,0,Studies have shown that gravity encourages collaboration.
20,5,4,"Ok, so no one is on my side."
19,1,1,"Well, I am the head of the company."
19,3,1,I'm sure we all are aware of the gravity of our situation.
18,5,0,I disagree that it's an uphill climb.
20,8,2,I think we've reached a tipping point.
19,3,2,"However, there is one downside to this new plan..."
19,5,1,Is the white board crooked?
19,5,0,You all need to learn how to handle the ups and downs of business...
18,0,0,"If we land it, they will come."
20,2,1,Casting call for Titanic
18,1,0,Everyone hold on to the window!
18,3,0,I don't appreciate the slant you've all taken on this issue.
19,5,1,It took an earthquake to prove that the self-leveling picture frame works!
18,0,1,"Ok, but we're still not taking the deal."
19,7,0,We need to work on levelling the playing field.
19,4,1,The company is pivoting in a new direction.
17,3,0,"As you may have noticed, we've done some restructuring."
20,2,2,The motion to move the office off the fault line is hereby passed.
19,5,1,How dare you accuse me of not leveling with you!
20,3,1,Although this may appear to be a power play on my part. . .
17,0,0,"Well, anyway, you can obviously see that I am way better than you."
18,0,0,What does our contract say about leasehold improvements?
18,3,0,Now do you understand that this is a top down organization?
24,1,7,Welcome to New Balance.
19,5,2,"Ok, here's the angle."
21,3,2,I want to know which one of you contracted out the building renovations and I want to know now.
19,6,0,I'm told it was an iceberg on Lexington.
18,1,0,I need 3 of you willing to relocate this position.
17,0,0,I HAVE brushed my teeth!
20,8,2,"Let's put it to a vote then - All in favor of Mary's proposal to install seatbelts in the restroom, say aye."
20,4,2,I don't think you guys are being straight with me
20,3,1,Why won't you people believe me? Trickle-down economics works.
20,4,2,"'' After Ms. Davenport's presentation, we're having sliders for lunch.''"
18,2,0,"As far as this next project goes, I think we could all agree, not only has that ship sailed, it's now sinking."
18,2,0,So the all-natural deodorant isn't working?
17,0,0,What I'm saying here is that we're a little top heavy.
17,0,0,My survey indicates you feel I'm slanted
21,0,2,"No really, this is on the level."
18,0,0,Let me start by saying the company hopes you are enjoying our new state-of-the-art shipboard offices. We're still working out some issues.
18,0,0,This demonstrates the need to reverse our downward trend
18,0,0,I'm happy to call to order the first board meeting in our new Frank Gehry-designed headquarters.
18,3,0,"Don't move, this is a trust exercise"
18,2,0,"And this my friends, is the teeter-totter effect."
16,3,0,The external audit suggested new perspectives.
18,1,0,It's downhill from here onward....
19,1,1,The new layout of our meeting rooms will ensure that we evaluate challenging decisions from all angles.
19,4,0,Come on. My breath can't be that bad.
19,5,0,It was supposed to be a metaphor!
20,3,1,"Now, let's look at this from a different angle!"
20,4,2,There's a motion that we become a standing committee.
19,5,2,Where's the elephant in the room when you need one?
18,1,0,"So, I would I be safe to assume that the consensus of this group would be the opposite of ""left leaning""?"
19,3,0,"As many of you may have guessed, our profits are beginning to slide."
18,3,0,You all need a new perspective.
18,2,0,You've painted yourselves into a corner. Now's the time to think outside the box.
17,0,0,"Since our building has shifted, do we all agree to change from chairs with wheels to chairs with suction cups?"
21,4,0,I believe it's safe to say that we're on the cusp of a paradigm shift.
18,1,1,If you think this is a bit awkward think how I feel.
17,3,0,"Since Brexit, we've been experiencing a downward trend."
22,8,4,"When the OSHA guy gets here, everyone look casual."
18,2,0,"Hearing no objections, motion carries..."
18,1,0,"Barnes, from the accounting department downstairs, requested a bouncy house for his retirement party. I approved it. Obviously, I didn't think it through."
17,0,0,hi Curtis we are here to talk to you about your hygiene.
17,0,0,I need some of you to come over here if we're to have a balanced meeting of the Seesaw Society.
19,7,1,Did I hear a motion?

17,3,0,It makes the year's financials presentation look much better.
19,5,0,New aftershave. Too much?
18,6,0,Rumors that the company is going downhill are vastly exaggerated.
21,2,3,It pays to get to meetings early

17,0,0,The ad department is looking for a new slant.

19,2,1,John couldn't help feeling that the meeting was somehow skewed...
19,0,1,Jones' popularity ebbed after farting during the board meeting.
18,1,0,I see differently.
17,0,0,"Hey, the Dow being down doesn't mean you have to be."
18,0,0,"In bad news, there is no money left in our Grappling Hook account."
17,3,0,"They said BREXIT might be a tipping point, but, this is ridiculous!"
17,2,0,"All in favor, say 'Wheeee!'"
19,1,1,"And of course when we're out of beta, there'll be a trapdoor and live sharks."
17,0,0,Let the minutes reflect that I will be chairing this meeting until the next aftershock.
19,9,1,So now that you appreciate the gravity of our situation...
20,4,1,We just need to change our perspective.
17,2,0,This isn't my fault. It's San Andreas' fault.
18,4,0,"Now, for a new slant on the problem."
18,0,0,"Alright, who turned on the ride?"
18,2,0,"Before I begin, I would like to welcome you all to the Acme Slide Company."
17,1,0,I feel like one of Batman's less famous super-villains.
18,1,0,I'm here to get things in line.
18,1,1,"As Chairman of the Board, I believe I can add a new dimension to this company."
18,1,0,"Right, so maybe a board room inside the Titanic wasn't the greatest idea."
17,3,0,"Okay then, first order of business - leveling the playing field."
17,0,0,What I tell you now is on the level.
18,1,1,"Ok, you win, it is SUPER glue."
18,0,0,"I said, ""I think we're having trouble with our axis of ordinates, not that we're axing subordinates."""
18,1,0,"Just before I shift my thinking next time you will have to remove your wheels. I can't stand your collective, pathetic flight to the corner."

21,2,2,Marketing suggests 'Tippecanoe'.
19,0,1,Is Wendy the only one with any balls in here?
20,2,2,"Yes, if you think it is prudent, we can put deodorant on the agenda under new business."
18,2,0,Do I perceive a tilt to the sentiment of the committee against the motion?
18,1,0,My father always said that getting into this chair is an uphill battle.
17,0,0,Toot...
21,2,2,We're meeting here today to address concerns about this company's perspective.
20,4,1,Who else feels my anger has gotten out of control?
19,1,1,"Gotta level with you, we need a new angle here."
17,1,0,"From now on, we'll be operating on a sliding scale."
18,0,0,"Don't let anyone tell you different, bubbulah, you came first."
18,1,0,"My apologies, it was deviled egg day in the cafeteria."
20,3,2,I was really hoping for your support on this.
19,3,1,"Location, location, location."
18,0,0,Now listen up.
20,2,1,Look. It's high time I leveled with you.
21,3,1,Ideally we'd be having this disaster preparedness training sometime before the actual disaster.

21,2,2,The whole damn scheme is collapsing.
18,1,0,We all knew Brexit could cause a downturn.
17,3,0,I don't like the way the balance of power has shifted.
18,2,0,I told you we shouldn't have gotten the chairs with the wheels
21,5,3,"Okay, so marbles are out. Any other thoughts?"
19,7,1,Our research indicates that fracking has absolutely no adverse effect on the environment.
17,1,0,Why is our market share slipping?
21,3,2,This meeting is going down hill fast.
17,2,0,"Why yes, I have lost weight. Thank you for noticing."
20,5,1,"Please understand, it is only through mere architectural idiosyncrasy that I'm talking down to you."
18,0,0,Can anyone look this up ?
23,9,6,This meeting of the Fox News editorial board will now come to order.
17,0,0,The top of the heap is below sea level.
20,4,1,Things are looking up.
18,0,1,Our creative accounting department tells me this is flat.
18,3,0,The gravity of your no confidence vote is apparent.
19,4,0,I think we can really come together now that the elephant is out of the room...
18,1,0,Perhaps we should table this item for further discussion.
19,6,0,Is everyone comfortable?
19,3,0,"All in favor, say ""Huh?"""
18,2,0,"Straighten things up or you'll be the fall guy, Pisa!"

18,1,0,The latest numbers show our down-cycle is worsening.
17,2,0,Now to address the Top Heavy Executive Compensation Plan...
18,3,0,"No worries, folks - Titanic II is the safest Mars shuttle ever built!"
17,1,0,The next release is devastating.
17,2,0,OK. I guess we'll just have to draw straws.
20,2,2,"On the plus side, today’s meeting space came in under budget."
18,1,0,Today's meeting is about what's trending down.
19,0,1,Hope none of are feeling slanted just because I'm in charge now.
20,4,1,Anyone who wants a donut come to this side of the room.
20,0,1,As you all know by now we have worked very hard to balance out the economy
19,7,0,I reject your slippery slope argument.
19,4,0,I can't put my finger on it but something feels askew?
21,2,3,I take that as disapproval of the proposed sliding pay scale.
20,4,1,Things may be looking up from where you are; but from here it's all downhill.
18,3,0,Your analogy is flawed. The Titanic's captain was navigating calm seas.
19,3,1,"...so on behalf of the Board, I want to say, 'This ship be sinking and the sky is the limit.'"
18,1,1,I concede. The company has indeed reached its tipping point.
18,1,0,What are you guys doing down there?!
17,3,0,"Be assured, none of your ideas are off the table for consideration."
18,0,0,"Please, gentleman and lady, it's all a matter of perspective!"
18,0,0,"No thanks, I don't chew gum."
18,1,0,"Sorry but from now on, the Topsy-Turvy Amusement Company will have only one chair-man of the board."
20,3,1,This feels like a lopsided conversation.
17,1,0,"Now that I have your undivided attention, I move that we go forth and fructify."
19,5,1,Now---which one of you is the architect?
19,0,1,Welcome to Cluster Sampling 101.
18,4,0,"Now, if there are no more objections..."
21,2,2,Looks like the balance of power has titled a bit.
18,1,1,It's not too late to right this ship.
18,0,0,"Unfortunately after Brexit, the pound isn't what it used to be."
18,1,0,I'm taking the lead for a new pilot collaboration setup. Your thoughts?
19,1,1,All this Brexit business is too far away to have any affect on us.
17,0,0,Folks here in the oil patch will tell you that fracking has gotten a bad rap.
19,2,0,And they said rearranging the chairs wouldn't make a difference...
20,4,1,Pay no attention to the painting on the wall.
18,1,0,"This room was created back when ""trickle down"" was a thing."
19,5,1,I'll concede your unanimous vote on this issue carries a lot of weight.
18,6,0,It's all a matter of perspective.
20,15,3,Can anyone bring something to the table?
17,3,0,It was the dog.
18,1,0,Play TILT THE TABLE: I'm the 1%; you're the 99%.
20,4,0,And that's just one more example of why I'm at the top and the rest of you aren't.
19,6,1,Looks like I remain as Chairman in a landslide.
18,0,0,"If this does not give us a new slant on the problem, nothing will."
19,4,1,"Self leveling picture frames , that's my pitch."
20,4,1,"Well, we all knew a ""leave"" win in the U.K. was going to cause problems for everyone."
18,1,0,"To better manage you people, I have unleveled the playing field"
19,4,0,'Let's get rolling' is just a figure of speech.
18,1,0,I suppose you all are wondering why I asked you here today
21,3,3,Not only is the rent cheaper but the building has great drainage
19,1,1,I'm really a people person
19,0,0,We're looking for fresh marketing ideas for the White Star Lines 1912 Summer Cruise schedule.
18,1,0,So who's going to explain to me why our stocks has plunged ? Bob ? Karol ?
19,1,1,Why do you say it's a weighted question?
20,4,1,You're in no position to negotiate
18,2,0,"Let's face it, we need a level playing field!"
18,2,0,It means stingy!
18,2,0,And who wants to volunteer for this assignment?
17,1,0,You're making me feel like the villain in a 'Batman' episode here.
21,2,1,"I just want you to understand we're facing a long, uphill battle."
22,6,6,I want to level with you all...
18,1,1,"Okay -- I get it. I'm cancelling the All Vegan, lo lactose, X soy, X lactose, X gluten, zero sugar beverages, zip alcohol Summer Picnic."
19,6,1,I don't see how a Feng Shui consultant can help us.
19,3,1,Its all up hill from here....
20,5,1,I hope you don't think I'm talking down to you.
20,3,2,And salaries will obviously be on a sliding scale.
19,4,1,You all say things are looking up; I have a different point of view!
19,0,0,"I understand that outsourcing IT can be slippery slope, but I'm staying the course. Thoughts?"
18,2,0,"thanks for swinging by. Now that I have the high ground, let's negotiate."
22,3,5,For our next Board meeting I believe we should seriously consider using TeleMeeting rather than a cruise ship.
20,3,2,"First off I'd like to acknowledge that, yes, the company relocation to Pisa has been difficult for all of us."
18,0,0,"When the architect told me the head of construction was a direct descendant of one of the most famous builders in Europe, I didn’t know he was referring to the guy who erected that tower in Pisa."
19,5,0,"So, the motion is for next firm retreat ashore. Seconder?"
17,2,0,Is this about my presentation or my new cologne?
20,2,2,I'm sure you understand the gravity of the situation.
17,0,0,The first successful karate chop gets the job.
20,2,1,Was it my breath?
17,1,0,If only I could share the credit with you!
18,2,0,"I never know whether to say ""you"" or ""you guys."""
18,5,1,Why am I the only one to bring anything to the table?
20,3,2,"Simon says, roll back to the table."
20,4,2,The first meeting of the housing committee of Pisa is adjourned.
18,6,0,So you all think we need to take a different slant?
19,7,2,"All those in favor of removing the wheels from their chair, say aye."
17,1,1,This is exactly why we don't piss off the sherpas!
17,1,0,...but last month you loved the idea of an office yacht?
20,3,2,I'm aware that this focus group skews to the right.
19,1,1,This discussion turned out to be more weighted than I anticipated.
22,2,2,"So we need a new slant, tilt things in our favor, take a new angle, tip the scales..."
20,5,1,You got the drift?
18,0,0,...and all against mutiny move to my side of the table.
18,2,2,WHAT flows downhill?
20,3,1,Your group condescension clearly reflects the gravity of the situation.
17,1,0,There have been some concerns about our bottom line.
18,0,0,"Know this, it is not easy to be on the board here at Tilt-A-Whirl."
18,0,0,"I get it, this quarter has been a teeter-totter."
21,0,3,Donald Trump's first Cabinet meeting.
14,2,0,"I just think Trump has some interesting ideas, is all."
20,3,1,Welcome to the Carnival Cruise Lines annual Board of Directors meeting...
18,1,0,"Welcome to the at sea meeting of the Rogue Wave Seminar Series. You may not be on my side now, but in about ten seconds, you'll all be with me."
17,2,0,This may be our last meeting on the Titanic.
18,3,0,5...4...3...2...
19,6,2,Did I promise you a level playing field?
18,2,0,I don't like talking down to people but...
17,2,0,"You can run, but you can't hide"
21,1,2,I'm afraid I am going to have to ask all of you to Cosine.
19,4,0,"As your new manager, I want you to know I'm very interested in your ideas and suggestions. Just bring them to the table for discussion."
17,2,0,I'll see if corporate can find the budget for some new conference chairs.
20,4,1,The board thinks we'll benefit from a new perspective.
19,5,1,I'd call this a landslide.
19,4,2,"""Level playing fields"" are overrated."
20,5,1,There is a motion to adjourn until after the earthquake. Any second?
18,2,0,"I dunno, the playing field looks pretty level to me."
21,2,2,"I'm still here for you, aren't I?"
18,0,0,You've all been chosen to sit on the committee for backwards thought. We'll meet in this room every week.
17,1,0,Just wait until the lady's turn to speak!
20,4,2,I feel certain I could bring a new perspective to your company.
18,3,0,I see the weight of opinion is against me...
18,3,0,No more IKEA contractors.
19,1,1,The table has definitely turned in my favor.
18,6,0,"Now, I understand there have been some wild rumors going around about a leveraged buyout."
20,5,1,Our customers must be convinced that we're on the level.
18,2,0,Bootstraps people. Bootstraps.
20,3,2,Admit it. You've let things slide.
19,5,2,I still think it would've been easier to just re-hang the wall art.
22,2,2,"Would you agree, the geometry doesn't feel right in this room?"
18,1,1,"Well, I see that my decision to stay on has weighed heavily on all of you..."
17,2,0,You all deserve a time-out
18,3,0,Who called me a lightweight?
17,2,0,I feel that things are a little out of kilter for today's vote
18,1,1,Rest assured; I bought your company to run it with you as equal partners.
18,0,1,Keep calm and carry on. It's just Brexit.
17,4,0,This isn't exactly what I meant when I said I wanted you to come up with a new angle
18,3,0,I’d like to call this meeting to visual order.
19,7,0,I understand the gravity of the situation.
17,3,0,"So, I'm the only one taking the high road here?"
17,1,0,Who's idea was it to have this meeting on a cruise ship?
20,2,2,Does that picture look crooked to you? It's driving me crazy.
20,4,1,Can someone please straighten the screen?
18,2,0,will somebody crooked that picture?
16,0,0,I didn't think my idea was that hill-arious.
19,5,0,From now on all voting will be judged by altitude.
18,0,0,"I have the greatest confidence in you, my engineering team who designed and built this great ship. I'm sure the iceberg is simply a temporary inconvenience and she will right. herself in a few minutes. Meanwhile, what do you want for lunch?"
18,1,0,"I understand the gravity of your position, but I appreciate the superiority of mine."
18,1,1,"Sure, there are going to be some challenges, but conference space in Pisa is not cheap!"
18,3,0,I know you're all angling for a seat at the table.
20,3,1,Now you can understand why I sit on this end of the table.
18,1,0,Welcome to the Vandelay Cruise Lines annual shareholder's meeting.
18,2,0,Trump you say? Enjoy the ride!
19,2,1,I learned this leverage technique from my children.
18,0,0,We partnered with a contractor over the weekend to allow you to revisit our Q2 sales & profit charts with fresh eyes this morning.
18,1,0,Slip n slide was always my favorite summer pastime.
18,0,0,Let's begin: Listen up everyone.
19,1,1,You must understand this group does not follow majority rule
17,0,0,"Towards the end of yet another rambling answer, the group interview reached its tipping point."
18,1,0,The most numerous complaint is that our content is coming from a rightward slant. Thoughts?
18,2,0,Maybe that pitch has too much slant.
19,1,1,Let's table this discussion until we can take a more balanced perspective on the matter.
19,6,1,You will be evaluated on a sliding scale
20,5,1,Is it the room or my breath?
20,1,2,"I didn't mean to, it snuck out."
19,3,1,"Oh alright, already. I'll bring back bouncy house Fridays."
18,0,0,Shut up Steve! You know i'm allergic to the human body.
19,4,2,I got a raise.
17,1,0,"Please, members of the board of the Merryview Mystery House, give me your undivided attention."

19,1,1,Don’t you like what the architect from Trump University did with the room?
19,5,0,My research didn't show the company as being this top heavy.
18,2,0,The new mouthwash account has some problems...agreed?
21,2,1,I'm about to turn your world upside down.
18,1,1,We have to stop letting things slide.
20,3,0,Are you all with me on this decision?
19,1,0,"Not exactly what I meant when I said ""hol' up, I need my lean to get turnt."" Y'all white af doe."
17,2,0,We're asking for a raise.
18,1,0,"I want you all to understand that you represent this company, and this company must be on the level at all times."
18,2,0,"I acknowledge the weight of your arguments, but I still win."
17,3,0,I think you all are aware of the gravity of our situation.
18,1,0,"Now who says we cannot make 'Titanic, the Sequel'?"
19,1,1,"""I guess we can dispense with 'a show of hands'""."
18,0,0,Welcome to the first meeting of Acme Weight Scales.
18,7,0,"Tell you what, I'm willing to meet you half-way"
22,1,3,"From your perspective, things are looking up!"
18,1,0,The inception of the teleconference.
19,5,0,"My sense is, we're on a slippery slope."
18,1,0,"So, Ho many lawyers does it take to screw in a light bulb?"
23,1,5,"I said ""Eureka"" not ""I've got Zika""."
19,6,1,"Someone is underperforming, and that's the elephant in the room we need to talk about."

16,0,0,"In my shop, this is as level as it gets. Live with it."
18,3,0,My achievements are immense when you all come together like this.
18,1,1,We lean a little to the right on this one.
19,3,1,It's just a cold!
19,2,1,Come on...I just had a tic tac.
17,1,0,Tilted to the far right without Donald Trump?
18,0,0,I call it tetter totter economics.
17,3,0,Is it really the floor or the corned beef and onions I had for lunch?
20,2,1,"Next on the agenda, the architects did inform me of a few design flaws that need straightened out."
18,7,1,I am inclined to disagree with the rest of you.
20,2,1,That you would choose this particular gesture of solidarity while we're meeting on a boat only serves to highlight the need for new ways of thinking.
20,5,1,I'm leaning towards agreeing with you
19,0,1,I suppose my greatest strength would be my dominion over gravity.
17,3,0,A: Our sales are up -OR- B: Our sales are down. Who wants to guess?
19,5,2,Anybody else planning to jump ship?
21,1,2,"Mr. Trump chose concrete over steel for economy, but they poured too much on this side of the tower."
18,3,0,You'll find that we encourage a level playing field.
17,3,0,Side effects include . . .
17,1,0,I often consult on uphill battles
18,5,0,One more no vote and I let go of this table.
18,1,0,You'll get your pizza when you pronounce it correctly.
18,1,0,"Good morning everyone. As usual, I will be an intimidating bully today....and you will sit down there and beg to keep your jobs!"
18,1,0,We maintain slanted views on this program.
18,6,0,I think it's about time we got this ship on an even keel.
20,2,1,"Damn it Jones, I told you, no roller chairs on the company yacht!"
19,0,1,Salaries will be based upon a sliding scale.
19,1,1,We have achieved our objective of streamlining decision making. I decide.
19,5,1,"I see the weight of your arguments, but I still feel I have the upper hand..."
19,1,1,Now this is what I call a level playing field!
19,6,0,"I prefer we use the term ""correction."""
18,3,0,I know my opinion doesn't carry much weight.
20,4,0,Is it just me or is it all downhill from here?
18,2,0,"Being so lop-sided, I guess you all wonder why I've called this meeting."
19,8,2,"As some of you may have noticed, the company is in decline."
18,3,0,"Clearly, we need to do some level setting."
19,4,1,Shall I chair?
18,3,0,Well I am Chairman.
19,4,1,First up on today's agenda: whoever purchased rolly chairs is fired.
18,1,0,I obviously have the upper hand here.
17,1,0,this department seems like its moving deck chairs around on the Titanic....
16,0,0,"Agreed, then. 97 % scientific consensus on the existence of gravity is acceptable to us."
20,2,1,I'm glad you're all on board with my proposal.
20,5,1,The first item on our agenda is a proposal that we take the wheels off of our chairs.
16,2,0,Earthquake.. I use glue
20,0,2,I propose we let the matter slide until the next meeting.
18,1,1,"Sorry, our glass ceiling just wasn't quite cutting it."
17,3,0,"OK, whose idea was it to have our board meeting on an ocean cruise?"""
21,1,3,Anyone up for beer pong?
18,1,0,Vice Presidential candidate under Donald Trump.
19,5,0,"Today's topic for discussion is ""Has political thinking in the United States shifted to the right?"""
17,4,0,"""Reports circulating that the company is going downhill are simply not true""."
20,2,1,"If the reader were holding this magazine straight, this wouldn't be even remotely funny."
18,3,0,So how did our Presidential poll turn out?
20,5,1,.......nor is the deck stacked against any of you.
19,1,1,Let me warn you that leaving this meeting will be an uphill battle.
19,3,1,...so they brought me in because I have a little bit of a different slant on things....
18,6,1,Now that we have established a level playing field...
18,3,0,"Someone contact engineering. I told them we need to right-size, not capsize."
18,1,1,Welcome to halitosis anonymous.
20,3,1,The Lombard Street Homeowners Association meeting will please come to order.
18,5,0,Is that crooked wall frame annoying anyone else?
19,7,2,In order to keep this company on an even keel I'm going to have to throw some of you overboard.
19,1,1,Our innovative employee fitness policy has set a new industry standard.
18,3,0,I've tilted things in my favor.
19,7,1,"Unfortunately, our architect was working on a sliding scale."
17,5,0,I'm becoming inclined to agree.
19,4,0,Are you sure we've got the right angle here people?
17,2,0,"Welcome to our Carnival Cruise Line ""Boardroom-At-Sea"" Auditing Ecstasy Getaway!"
17,1,0,"Okay, so anyone want to second the motion, we don't hold next year's AGM in a funhouse?"
19,4,1,Let's try to do our level best.
