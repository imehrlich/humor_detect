I'd like to see other people.
I know that look, you're not going to let this go.
I'd like to see other people.
What a delightful coincidence. I'm also recently single.
Maybe his second week will go better.
The corrupt media will blow this way out of proportion.
I want to start seeing other people...
Hopefully the president's second day in office will go a bit smoother.
Oh, and I'm gay.
I wonder what Donald will do on his second day?
I'm gay.
I'm not leaving. It's rent-controlled.
I want to see other people.
You just had to tear off that mattress tag.
On the plus side, Manhattan is affordable now.
I'd like to start seeing other people.
... and it's only January 21st.
I'm gay.
I won't fight the divorce...... you can have everything
The good news is they cancelled my colonoscopy.
Don't worry, he's going to replace it with something terrific.
He did promise to create more construction jobs.
We're just two people breaking up. It's not the end of the world.
It's only January, honey. Give him a chance!
Okay, maybe you did smell gas.
Give him a chance, they said. How bad could he be, they said.
Well, maybe the second 100 days will be better.
I think we should see other people.
Don't look at me. I voted for Hillary.
I think we should see other people.
Remember when you said you'd only date me if I was the last man on earth?
So, what do you think he'll do in his second term?
Well, that's one inauguration I don't think any of us will ever forget.
That was one hell of an inauguration
I would like to see other people
On the positive side, no more Twitter.
It's still not the worst first date I've been on.
I'm very anxious to see Trump's second day in office.
You're now looking at the handsomest man alive.
So then the genie says, "Sure, I'll make you the sexiest man alive..."
Maybe we should have voted.
Who knew the Nuclear codes were just 140 characters?
Well Joan, now I am the last man on earth.
Explain to me again how this is all my fault.
It's not like it's the end of the world.
Okay, maybe I should have read the instructions.
So I guess this is my fault?
I want to see other people.
It said microwave safe
Other than that, I think our first date went well.
I liked it better when he just tweeted.
I hear they've canceled his Twitter account.
I liked America better before it was great...
Well, at least he drained the swamp!
Is it too soon to say "I told you so?"
Remember that time you said even if I were the last man on Earth?
What do you mean "if" I was the last man on Earth?
No, I haven't seen your glasses.
But I am the last man on earth.
So much for the first 100 days!
I'm guessing this will come up in therapy tomorrow.
Why would they even have that button on the copier?
In retrospect, last year wasn’t so bad.
I guess we will never see his tax returns.
There goes the neighborhood.
I don't know, what do you want to do?
I think now is the time to buy.
So ... NO metal in the microwave?
You know the media always tries to blow things out of proportion.
You make it sound like it's the end of the world.
I suppose this is my fault, too.
Gesundheit.
I told you not to remove the tags on the pillow.
You're figuring out a way to make this all my fault, aren't you?
I met someone.
Game over. Someone played the Trump card.
I still say 2016 was worse.
Are you feeling the Bern now.
That was close.
I think now is the time to buy.
I told you not to open the attachment.
On the bright side, I'm now less worried about my carbon footprint.
I told you not to remove the tag from the pillow.
In hindsight, maybe the launch code shouldn't have been 12345.
Have you seen the cat?
Yea, but think of all the construction jobs he just created!
Okay, next time I'll read the instructions!
What's it going to take for twitter to suspend his account?
The first sign was the Cubs winning the World Series.
At least we have a shot at getting Hamilton tickets.
Well at least we don't have to worry about his second term.
Honey, have you seen my Samsung 7?
I'll let you keep the house.
Did you remember to lock the front door?
So, not even if I am the last man on earth?
I suppose this is also my fault.
Now you have my complete attention.
Cheer up. I hear this is fake news.
So.... how was your day?
Well, now that I actually am the last man on earth . . . .
On the plus side, the 3:00AM tweets have stopped.
Not with a bang but a tweet.
Well, at least it was a short presidency
It's a little late to change your vote.
Yes, I realize I said nothing could be worse than 2016...
You seem upset.
Actually, I have all the time in the world
At least he can't tweet anymore.
Think we just inherited the earth.
Okay. You were right. You DID smell gas.
I hope this is fake news
For the last time, it's pronounced nuclear, not nucular.
Why is everything always MY fault?
I swear. There's no one else.
Well that was one of our more memorable arguments.
Did you turn off the stove?
Jeez! The Inauguration was only yesterday!
I guess this is all my fault too.
Well, it appears we waited too long to move to Canada.
You win, he is that crazy.
I hear they've finally canceled his Twitter account.
I appreciate your dedication to keeping this appointment.
Never...ever...ask Siri that again.
To think it started as a Twitter war.
You are positively glowing.
Well, the good news is he can't tweet anymore.
it's still his first year in office, give him a chance !
Well at least Hamilton tickets might be available
On second thought, maybe we shouldn't see other people.
"How much could go wrong in four years," you said.
Who was the idiot that put the nuclear codes on Twitter?
Well, you're not my first choice to repopulate the Earth either.
On the bright side, Mexico is building a wall to keep us out.
You said we'd all make it through his first 100 days. You owe me five dollars.
Well, the repeal part is done.
So...you can have the house
You were right. Are you happy now?
Okay, he probably shouldn't have tweeted that.
Yes, in retrospect, I would change my vote.
Well, at least Trump Tower is gone.
Fine. Neither of us keep the house.
Apparently, he thought it was the tweet button
Uber says 9 minutes barring another attack
Actually, his first week went better than I expected.
They took away his Twitter account.
No, Sharon, I'm not happy now.
Get him a chemistry set you said!
Okay. Perhaps aluminum foil should not go in the microwave.
I was on board for making America great again, but I didn't think they'd start from scratch ...
I suppose you're not cooking dinner tonight?
Tell the lawyer you can keep the house.
Not even if I'm the last man on earth?
How about now that I actually am the last guy on earth?
Where were we?
The last thing I remember was pulling the lever in the voting booth
That was a hell of a tweet
Well at least we made it to the final two.
Oh please don't tell me you're gay.
Are we Great Again yet?
So apparently Twitter is not a great medium for foreign policy.
Well, it was 4 A.M. and I guess he just thought he could tweet on his new, red phone.
Fine. You were right. I should have read the directions.
"Not great. How was your day?
I'm not worried, he said this is just fake news.
Somehow you're going to make this MY fault.
Now that was a spectacular Inauguration!
Give the man a chance, honey. He’s only been in office a week.
Well at least we got Obamacare repealed.
Remember when you said you wouldn't date me if I were the last man on earth?
I wonder what the other button did.
You act like it's the end of the world.
Now that I AM the last man on earth, do you feel any differently?
I can't believe it is only January 21st.
OK—Now I'm with her.
... and it's only January 21st.
So, I guess we'll never know whether it was the Russians, the Chinese, or that four hundred pound guy sitting on the edge his bed.
On a more positive note it eliminates the need for a wall.
That was some inauguration, eh?
How have things been going otherwise?
I've been looking forward to being alone with you.
You didn't pierce the potato skin before you put it in the microwave.
It turned out that Putin didn't like Trump that much.
Well it's finally happened, Shirley...We're all dressed up with no place to go.
Turns out 140 characters IS enough.
C'mon, Judy. I'm literally the last man on Earth.
Oh sure, now you want to move to Canada.
Why does everything have to be my fault?
You still think we should keep the Electoral College?
A bigger person might let this go, but I still hate that sweater on you.
January 21, 2017. "Well, that didn't take long."
Oh, so this is my fault?
We'll, Glenda, it looks like I am the last man on Earth.
'I think the Inauguration went well, don't you'?
Some Inauguration, huh?
Who did he tweet this time?
Well, actually, I AM the last man on Earth."
Somehow I'm not feeling 'Great Again'...
So--are you still going to the Women's March tomorrow?
Well that was the tweet to end all tweets.
So just to clarify, that was NOT even if I was the last man on earth?
OK, so I voted wrong -- you act like it's the end of the world!
But 'Kim Jong Eun is a stinkyface' was a pretty funny tweet ...
Don't care what the neighbors might say, I still think you can control the heat easier with a gas range...
So, now that I AM the last man on Earth...
In real estate we call this an opportunity.
Adam. And you?
The glass is always half empty with you, isn't it?
Sure, maybe it was Russia. Maybe it was China. For all we know, it was a 400 kiloton guy sitting on his bed in New Jersey!
Your exact words were, "Maybe if you were the last man on earth."
Apparently, our neighborhood was ruining the view from his golf course.
I may not be 'The One.' But I am the one left.
No, I distinctly remember you saying only if I was the last man on earth.
I voted for change.
I'm seeing someone else.
Remember when you said, "not if you were the last man on earth"?
Good party.
Now that we've leveled the playing field, can we talk?
Well, that was one hell of an inauguration week.
All right, what's the SECOND worst that could happen?
Okay, you can have the house.
Yea, but think of all the construction jobs he just created!
You take the house.
I think we just experienced the 'temperamentally unfit' part.
You win.
But I'm pretty sure I am the last man on earth, Jean.
A lot of people are saying this didn't happen.
I'd like to revisit your "Not even if you were the last man on Earth" statement, Linda.
You looked less surrounded by devastation in your profile.
I told you we shouldn't have gotten Samsung phones!
And yet they still won't abolish the Electoral College.
I heard that President Trump thought the red button was for room service!
Ok, maybe we do need counseling.
So maybe we should scrap the Electoral College.
And to think it's only been ten days since the inauguration.
To be fair, he's only been in office for a month.
...and what do you think we can expect for the SECOND week of the new administration?
So... what are your plans for his second day in office?
Still think we shouldn't take him literally?
"Talk about dumb luck...Only female left on earth and it's my 2nd grade teacher"!
Did you have any trouble finding the place?
We shouldn't have joked about his penis.
I'm starting to think 2016 wasn't that bad...
So... wanna repopulate?
Take-out tonight?
And you said, "How much damage can he possibly do in four years?"!!
Honestly, I love you more than anyone else on Earth.
Soooo, you live around here?
Happy now?
I don't think the bus is coming.
Well, I AM the last man on earth, and I'd like you to reconsider.
Trump just tweeted that their first strike was 'overrated'.
I wonder what the next 3 years and 364 days will be like.
He really got down to business those first 100 days, I'll give him that.
Why does everything have to be the end of the world with you??
I suppose it depends on your definition of 'great again.'
I told you we should move to Canada.
Do we still have to use a condom?
Kind of puts climate change on the back burner, doesn’t it?
The first 100 days went better than I thought.
What do you mean there's another man?
Now do you believe I smelled gas?
Does this mean we're cockroaches?
...and anyway, it's pronounced 'nuke-u-lar,' Edna.
In retrospect, that last tweet may have been a mistake.
The good news is they've found our luggage.
Well, at least he didn't use a private server for his government emails
Well that escalated quickly.
Ha! They all laughed when we scrunched down under our desks.
I said yes, 'yes the gas is not off'.
Okay, NOW you have my full attention.
Hey, don't look at me... I voted for Hillary
This calls for a selfie
Do you think we still have wi-fi?
I don't think the bus has ever been this late before.
I told you I smelled gas.
Now's the best time to buy
Okay, but let's not forget about Hillary's emails.
Let's eat out tonight.
Looks like you'll meet your deductible...
Unfortunately, we still haven't met our deductible.
What a relief! The president just tweeted that reports of total destruction were all fake news.
Sorry, Eve; I'm gay.
I know what you said before, but now that I AM the last man on earth.......
OK, can we just agree that I was wrong when I said, "it's just an election, it's not the end of the world" and move on?
So, it appears you did NOT turn off the coffee maker.
I think we should start seeing other people.
In retrospect divorce mediation might have been a better choice.
You look a bit less cheerful than your online photo.
When I said that George, I didn't think you'd actually be the last man on Earth.
So much for cozying up to Putin
So...are you single?
Give him a fair shot-he's only been in office a week.
It started with a Tweet.
No, I did not put something metallic in the microwave.
Would I vote for him again? Probably not.
Well, I voted for change.
Only four more years.
It's just more fake news.
Somehow I think this will end up being my fault.
Fake news!
As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted...
I don't see a future for us.
Might you reconsider now that I AM the last man on Earth?
I hear Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin are untouched.
As nuclear winters go, it's been quite a mild one.
We should start thinking about the midterm elections.
What do you say now? I AM the last man on earth.
Don't worry - this is just an invention of the liberal media.
Well, Martha, he still has three years to make America great again.
Just had to keep tweeting about his hair, didn't you?
I guess Putin didn't think that tweet was funny.
Well, now we really have nothing to talk about.
So, is this your first apocalypse?
I still say give him a chance.
Well, I AM the last man on earth...
Well... now I am the last man on earth
So...we're off the hook for dinner with your mom?
Remember when you said, "not even if you where the last man on earth..."
I know it wasn't a great first date, but can I call you?
And you were worried about the repeal of Obamacare.
No neighbors and an open concept. Looks like we both get what we want.
I was wrong. Things could get worse.
On the plus side, Obamacare was repealed.
I should have clarified what you meant by nuclear family.
I saw fireworks. How was it for you?
I think we should try to see other people.
Satisfied?
Don't blame me. YOU voted for him.
What do you mean "if" I was the last man on Earth?
Have you seen the remote?
The good news is, you get to repopulate the earth. The bad news, you get to do it with me.
I'm usually more fun on the second date.
So...now that I really am the last man on earth...
This is probably not the best time for me to come out of the closet....
So much for "Putin likes me and that is an asset"!
I specifically told the travel agent ANCIENT ruins.
My bucket list has changed. What about yours?
Something tells me the bus isn't coming.
Why do you always have to go ballistic?
One tweet too many?
Oh well, we did vote for change.
This seems to be the "for worse" part
Ten bucks says the bus is late!
And that was just his inaugural speech.
He'll get the hang of it by his second term.
Well, they've taken care of Housing and Urban Development. I guess Energy is next.
Well, as it turns out, I am the last man on earth...
And you were worried about a second term.
"Korea's missiles are overrated" he Tweeted.
Well, you said you wouldn't marry me unless I was the last man on Earth.
Thank Goodness we finally have the place to ourselves!
Well, this is your chance to say, 'I told you so'.
Well, you have to admit he did a lot in his first 100 days!
Have you changed your mind now that I AM the last man?
Well, it looks like we have time to talk now
I think we should see other people, assuming we can find some.
This is going to create tremendous jobs in the construction industry.
Okay, maybe I should have read the instructions.
At least he won't be reelected.
Well it drained the swamp.
So...are you single?
On the plus side, our lawyers won't be getting anything either.
...and it's only been three days since the Inauguration!
I was wrong, you were right. Happy?
And then Kim Jong-un tweeted, "Meryl Streep isn't overrated, Helen Mirren is overrated."
Maryanne, do you remember when you said, 'Maybe if you were the last guy on earth.'?"
I guess your mother won't be staying with us after all.
So what's the worst thing that can happen?
At least this hurts his chances for a second term!
So, is this your first apocalypse?
No wonder we could get tickets.
I heard what sounded like a 'tweet', and then a tremendous boom, tremendous boom.
"It's only four years," they said. "He can't possibly do that much," they said.
I think it's an appropriate time to talk about our future.
I wonder what day two of the Trump presidency is going to be like...
To make a country great again, sometimes you need to start from scratch.
First we rebuild a Starbucks. We'll figure out the rest from there.
Well Linda, now I am the last man on Earth.
Well, that was an interesting 4 years
They say it started as a tweet.
I'm moving out.
Say what you will, at least he didn't have a private e-mail server.
So, this is what 'Great Again' looks like.
On the bright side; no more tweets.
You can cross de-cluttering off your to-do list.
I told you the inauguration would be a blast
Seriously? Not even if I really was the last man on earth?
Otherwise, it was a great 100 days.
And I say we should reserve judgement till we see what he does in his second hundred days.
Fake news--all of it.
Great enough for you?
Aside from this, how have you been?
I suppose you'll find some way to blame this all on me.
Mind if I smoke?
Okay, in retrospect maybe he did show signs of self-serving narcissistic megalomania.
Would it help if I said I'm sorry.
"I wonder what he tweeted this time".
Ok, NOW we can make America great again.
So...can I get you a brick or anything?
Honey, you're overreacting. It's not the end of the world.
Do you think it was that last tweet?
Is it not our duty to at least try to repopulate the earth?
Well, it does make the divorce settlement easier.
I heard it's just fake news
If Facebook still existed, I'd unfriend you.
See? I told you that he had a foreign policy.
Think harder! I'm sure you can find a way to blame me for this.
I suppose this is all my fault, too.
We'll always have the Pre-Apocalypse.
So, repopulate?
Yeah, but what about Hillary's emails?
Don't you get it? I really am the last man on earth
But I am the last man on earth.
On the bright side, it is unusally warm for this time of year.
He did this with a tweet?
Now that we ARE the last two people on earth, have you reconsidered?
Perhaps you would like to re-think your position now that I actually am the last man on Earth.
I still say there is no proof that this was caused by human activity.
So much for the Samsung Galaxy.
So it's a twenty minute wait for a table. It's not the end of the world.
You looked younger in your picture.
I suppose you're going to say 'I told you so'.
Do you still think inviting both sets of parents was a good idea?
He may have made an error in judgment, but we still don't know what was in Hillary's emails.
It looked much different in the brochure.
You don't look like your profile picture either.
I wonder if we'll get our security deposit back.
The wall looks tremendous, though.
At least it's a dry heat.
Come to think of it, maybe I didn't turn the gas off.
You just had to go and buy the Samsung Galaxy Note 7.
Well, the Earth isn’t going to repopulate itself.
Those four years sure flew by, didn't they?
My ex-place or yours?
Do you still think we should start seeing other people?
Saturday the 21st. Why?
At least he's off Twitter.
Well, we made it through day 1....
At least we're a nuclear family again.
So...other than that, how was your day?
At least he didn't use his own email server.
Considering the circumstances, I'm willing to waive my broker's fee.
I think you should stop trying to cook.
I just don’t understand how this could have happened. He was so good on ‘The Apprentice’!
Well, I don't smell gas anymore.
His Twitter feed says it didn't happen.
On the plus side, we repealed Obamacare.
Yeah, but what about those emails?
Your place or mine?
Well you got your wish - no more Sunday football.
And to think he isn't officially President yet....
But I really am the last man on earth.
Not even if I was the only man on earth, huh?
I still say we should give him a chance.
NOW, how's Canada looking to you?
At least we won!
And you said we wouldn't survive a Trump presidency!
Who'd have thought we could afford a place in Manhattan?
Turns out elections DO have consequences.
I'm willing to concede they probably should've taken away his Twitter.
Yeah but still... the e-mails!
My ex-place or yours?
We'll "repopulate the world" when I don't have a headache.
Really! You've never made a mistake?
Give it another 100 days.
Well Louise, I think now we know what that button does.
They're saying it’s a buyer’s market though.
Okay, so maybe it is time to get rid of the electoral college.
Maybe we should have voted.
So, I forgot your birthday. It's not the end of the world.
I thought we were going to be O.K. but then Putin tweeted something about his hair.
I can't believe you locked the keys inside the bunker.
Let's see if the cockroaches are alive.
They're already rebuilding the Starbucks.
I guess this makes you the new Eve.
Well, I'm the last man earth. What do you say?
To be fair Linda, Russia insulted us first.
And if I WAS the last man on earth?
But it pales in comparison to that private email server.
I too enjoy long romantic walks through the apocalypse
Alright, I did leave the oven on.
I don't care if you are the only person left; you don't look anything like your photo
This certainly simplifies the divorce settlement.
I thought Aleppo was one of the Marx brothers.
That was one hell of an inauguration
Do hou have any plans for tonight ?
It’s amazing what some people can accomplish with just 140 characters.
Well, the roaches ARE dead, aren't they?
Even though I AM the last man on Earth?
At least they repealed Obamacare.
Trump tweeted that we won.
Give the guy a chance. The media always blows things out of proportion.
Well...he did say it was going to be "huuuge".
Its hard to believe the inauguration was just last night...
At least we still have Obamacare.
But I AM the last man in the world.
I'm the Senate. You be the House.
I think Tripadvisor has been hacked.
If only we met under different circumstances.
I know when you say "I'm fine" like that, it's not actually fine.
And my mother is still coming.
And I suppose this is my fault too?
I guess it's up to us, Eve.
He said it was going to be huge.
I guess that was Trump's last tweet.
Looks like I'm the last man. Still no?
Everything was fine until Trump tweeted, "Russian arsenal highly overrated. Putin #sad!"
I expected you to choose divorce, not the nuclear option.
So, was that the first time you used a pressure cooker ??
I dunno. What do you want to do?
I miss the old neighborhood.
Remind me again why the electoral college is so great.
Now you've ruined everything.
So...what do you like to do for fun?
OK, Gladys, now that I actually AM the last man on earth, what was it you were saying?
So, would you like to hear my side?
On the bright side, the swamp's been drained.
You can keep the house.
Okay, I gave him a chance. Now what?
What do you mean not if I was the last man on earth? I am the last man on earth.
Oh, that's just fake news -- we're definitely great again.
I'll have to check but I believe State Farm.
So, the good news is that you are insured.
That was some inauguration!
Okay. You were right.
Looks like one of us will have the last word after all.
You voted for him.
I told you it was real news.
I can make this up to you.
My first dates usually don't go this well.
You lost, we won. Get over it
Personally, I'm surprised. I thought we'd get a month out of him before this would happen."
It's post-apocalyptic, not dystopian.
How's that protest vote feeling now?
I told you set the oven at 350, but noooooo....
So much for the first 100 days!
' Illusionist overreach.' "YOU THINK? "
Maybe next Christmas we don't host both our families.
All right. You win.
So I said, so he won, what's the worst that could happen?
Remind me of the things you would do if I was the last man on earth.
So how long have you been on the post-apocalyptic dating site?
Selfie?
OK, fine. I guess in hindsight her emails weren't that bad.
Don't worry. The House republicans will rein him in any day now.
Next time, don't ask them to warm up the croissant.
Yes, I voted for change, why do you ask?
What makes you so sure we missed the last bus?
No regrets whatsoever! Have you forgotten all the emails she deleted?
I'm still convinced this is just more fake news.
I assumed it was microwave safe.
Who knew Meryl Streep had nukes?
I don't know. What do you want to do tonight?
According to eHarmony, we have a lot in common.
Yes I'm sure I turned the stove off!
All I'm saying is you may have overreacted.
Still, no.
Yeah but we won.
Well, you were the one who said you wanted to start over.
Don't worry. He'll Make Armageddon Great Again.
The human race is in trouble; I've had a vasectomy.
All in all, I think the Inauguration went well.
You just had to touch the red button.
I'm still not sleeping with you.
Those four years really flew by.
I know, but what about her emails.
How about Hillary's emails though?
I think it's best I leave the cooking to you from now on.
Melania thought it was an eyesore.
I think I hear the smoke alarm.
Did you unplug the iron?
I'm telling you, this "nuclear war" is fake news fabricated by the liberal media.
I asked you not to hit control-alt-delete.
Tweeting "you don't have the guts to push the button" may have been a little impulsive.
Oh and I suppose Hillary would have done better.
I don't know. What do you wanna do?
Fine, but Obama is the second-worst.
Do you still want to argue about who gets the house?
At least we got rid of Obamacare.
So, is America Great Again yet?
Speaking of languages, how's your Russian?
On a totally different topic, how about if we let women run things for a while?
I guess it depends on your definition of "great".
Your hair looks particularly lovely this morning.
You're the one who pulled my finger.
I'm guessing we won't be seeing our luggage anytime soon....
You ruin everything.
So, how do you feel about long walks in the rain, cuddling, and hoarding canned goods?
Now that I really am the last man on earth, have you reconsidered?
Oh,like Hillary's first 100 days would have gone any smoother!
Don't look at me! I voted for Clinton!
Do you live around here?
Well then, day one of the Trump Presidency wasn't so bad, eh?
I'm just not feeling post-apocalyptic yet.
At least there will be no more tweets.
When I said to nuke it, I meant for you to use the microwave.
Now can I talk?
At least now we won't have to build a Wall.
It's not the end of the world.
Take out for dinner?
Mistakes were made.
Do you happen to have a harmonica?
Now you understood why you don't put metal in a microwave.
You did say "if you were the last man on Earth..."
So...How's that "Make America Great Again" thing working out for you so far?
You did say if I was the last man standing....
Well, our decluttering issue has been resolved.
I guess "till death do us part" still applies.
I still like that he says what's on his mind, though
I think the first thing we should do is repopulate the planet.
How was traffic?
This is not the change I voted for.
Apparently we won.
Why is it always my fault?
'Just give him a chance' you said.
This would be the week I make finalist in The New Yorker reverse caption contest!
Is this a bad time to talk?
So much for the smooth transition of power.....
Okay. This time maybe I did ruin everything.
Your rubble or mine?
I still want a divorce, Carl.
I'm pretty sure we can make it great again...
Fine! Next time we'll call the electrician.
You know, it's not the end of the world.
I'd hate to see a category 5 tweetstorm.
Is America great yet?
Are we Great Again yet?
Yes, I am happy we're great again.
I know I said I'd only date you if you are the last man on earth, but....
He'll act more presidential after the inauguration.
Yeah, but Hillary's emails.
Check twitter
So...is this your first stab at post-apocalyptic dating?
So. Are you still optimistic?
See, I told you he personally responds to every tweet.
Trump. Why do you ask?
Next year, we are using my travel agent.
Do you smell gas?
No thanks, I'm gay.
Didn't you wonder why the air fare was so cheap?
Do you still want to wait for Godot?
'Just another inauguration,' you kept telling me. 'What could possibly go wrong?'
We were warned, yes, but it was fake warned.
Satisfied?
Well, you said you wanted to get rid of the clutter.
When you cross your arms like that I think that we're not going to re-populate the planet.
Nobody said being great again would be easy.
Maybe these intelligence briefings could have been useful, after all.
For the last time, go see a gastroenterologist.
Alright, maybe Trump wasn't the best choice.
Well Mr. "Just Give Trump a Chance," you're awfully quiet today.
Told ya.
All I'm saying is I think a cooking class could be helpful...
Next time, can I just call an electrician?
All this because of a stupid tweet!
So, what did you think of the inauguration?
Well, you voted for change. Happy?
He thought he hit the button to send a tweet, but obviously he was wrong.
Well, he did keep some parts of the Affordable Care Act.
I told you I thought I smelled gas.
That's the last time we invite both our families on the same night!
But the good news is, I finally found something that works on bedbugs.
Happy with your level playing field?
Well... THAT could have gone better.
Mistakes were made.
We haven't had an argument like that in quite a while
I still feel that I need to date other women.
Would it have killed you to have left the tag on the damn pillow?
So I suppose you're thinking this is my fault.
I read in your profile that nothing fazes you.
I used to know a good Italian place near here.
Too bad about that typo on twitter.
There you go again. Always blowing things up out of proportion!
well, there goes the neighborhood.
Did you cancel the paper?
Next time launch codes should be longer than a tweet.
Okay, so that's decluttering done. What's step two?
Any chance this is fake news?
I don't care if I am the last man on Earth, I'm still gay.
OK. So having both sets of in-laws come for the holidays wasn't the greatest idea.
Okay, we're in agreement: No snakes, no apples.
Do you live around here?
At least we're out of the house.
I should have voted.
We'll get along better if we never discuss who voted for who.
For my online dates, I always meet in a public place.
Let me just remind you that YOU voted for him too!
Next time you think you smell gas, tell me.
I like you, but not 'last night on earth' like you.'
Did you remember to cancel the paper
Remember what you said you'd do only if I was the last man on earth. Well...
Just what make you think I did not read the directions.
I always wondered what a level playing field would look like.
They said not to try it at home
That's the last time I try to give the cat a pill!
I was hoping to surprise you with dinner.
Yes, but without the internet how can I be certain you are the last man on Earth?
The timing may be bad, but I want a divorce.
Shiela was talking about getting a group together to reinvent the wheel.
On the plus side, I was able to drop the cable company.
Well at least America's great again.
Congratulations, Agnes, you prattled on til doomsday.
Oh what, like Hillary would have been any better?
Crazy how we keep getting set up on Match.
We'll always have Paris...
Ok, I should've read the manual!
It was a great apocalypse. Huge!
Yes, there is time now, but I have a headache.
At least 2016 is over.
Still, what's the worst that can happen?
Should we start repopulating?
OK, next year we'll go where you want.
Okay, you can have the house.
If we can make it here, we can make it anywhere.
And I suppose this is my fault isn't it?
I'll admit that my support of the Electoral College is starting to wane.
Are you still a Republican?
So now do you believe that elections have consequences?
Well, we made it. The 0.1 per cent.
Your place or mine?
Maybe her private email server wasn't so bad after all.
It doesn't matter what war zone I take you to, you're never satisfied.
Of course I'd vote for him again.
I hear the Waffle House is still open.
Actually, I think we are still in Kansas.
What a coincidence - I am the last man on earth.
Fake apocalypse.
Are we still doing brunch?
Well, it's only four years
A smaller America will be easier to make great again.
On the other hand, I hear his beautiful wall is doing great.
....and then the President started mocking Kim Jong Il and I turned off the TV and fell asleep.
No, I don't think we'll get our deposit back.
Look on the bright side... You say we never get out of the house.
I've decided to give up smoking.
See, I told you not to put foil in the microwave.
No, I did not put metal in the microwave.
At least he didn't have a private server
I don't know. Let's at least give him a chance.
This is why we can't have nice things.
I suppose this is somehow all my fault?
I know the last thing you want to hear right now is 'I told you so.'
Don't give me that look. You voted for him, too.
What's a nice girl like you doing in an apocalypse like this?
I don't mean to brag, but I am the last man on Earth.
So, what stage of "make America great again" is this ?
Is your wifi working?
You up for repopulating the earth?
Well now I AM the last man on earth, so whaddya say?
What really upsets me is that I can't find my 'Make America Great Again' cap.
To think it all began with a Tweet.
So, I guess that makes me the last man on earth.
He's been tweeting again.
Okay, maybe that vote for Trump wasn't the best decision of my life ...
We should have sold when we had the chance.
Any idea where the Dow closed today?
Do you remember whether our deductible was $500 or $1,000?
It looked nicer in the brochure.
I still think couples counseling would have been worth a try.
It doesn't seem great again.
So I guess I shouldn't ask what's for dinner?
It's kind of boring with no zombies.
Are we eating out, again?!
Have you seen my "Make America great again" hat?
Well that escalated quickly.
He said he liked Putin, he didn't say Putin liked him.
Well, Hillary would've been worse.
Still think your protest vote was worth it?
On the brighter side, Bernie is running in 2020!
At least Tinder still works.
Want to start a post-nuclear family?
Maybe this one time, we should have just gone to bed angry.
Don't look at me. I voted for Hillary.
Otherwise, how was your day?
Get over it. Everybody farts.
Care to take back that 'last man on Earth' comment?
I apologize. I overreacted.
I blame the media
Our carbon footprint can only get smaller now.
So, has my one in a billion chance improved any?
How many times do I have to say it, Helen? If I could go back and change my vote, I would.
Well, it was, "huuuge."
Sorry. I didn't think he'd win.
Well, I think you're overreacting.
Not even if I was the last man on earth?
So, remember when you said, "Not if we were the last two people on earth?"
And we never saw the tax returns.
Well, we've been wanting to become minimalists.
So, did you really mean that last-man-on-earth thing ?
It's not like it's the end of the world.
In retrospect I would have preferred a global warning.
It could be Russia, it could be China, it could be Donald sitting in his bed.
Has it really been just six month since Ben Carson was confirmed?
I've lived in Detroit all my life. Why do you ask?
What do we do now that we're "great" again?
No more 5 alarm chili
You wanted a level playing field.
A transfer of power always has some glitches.
So we're agreed? We tell everyone we found it like this.
Alright already, yes, I should have read the instructions.
So what do you think of the 2nd amendment now?
This is not what I imagined "Great Again" would be like.
Pull my finger, he said. . .
Well, we finally have nothing left to talk about.
I guess this means your mother won't be staying with us anytime soon.
Okay, okay, I should have voted for her.
Don't blame me. YOU voted for him.
It still is a very walkable neighborhood.
Ah. alone at last!
"Are you willing to reconsider now that I actually am the last man on Earth"?
Remember when I said I would not marry you if you were the last woman on earth?
Happy now?
I said not even if we were the last two people on Earth.
So do I have your undivided attention now?
When you called me and said "there goes the neighborhood" I thought you meant....
I just tweeted that his hair looks fake.
I still say I could never have voted for someone who used a private email server.
Look on the bright side. We still have each other.
I thought he was just gonna blow up Washington.
Fine, I'll say it. I'm sorry I voted for Trump. Feel better?
Yeah, but Hillary would've been worse.
At least he didn't use a private e-mail server.
So this is great again.
Oops, I guess we forgot to childproof the red button.
Remember all those times you said, "Not if you were the last man on earth!"?
I'm wondering if this will have an effect on the mid-term elections.
All I did was tweet that our neighborhood went 100% for Hillary
Is that a new shade of lipstick?
Heck of a tweet, huh?
The drone delivery system still has a few bugs.
Are you happy now?
His tweet about this ought to be really good.
I feel like I am not getting enough credit for still being alive.
Now is the time to get in.
I guess elections do have consequences.
Sorry Arnold, I just don't see a future for us.
You realize, of course, that I am, in fact, the last person on earth.
What difference does it make who left the oven on?
Now that we have cleared the air...
I told you our marriage would survive.
But what about her emails?!!
Where would you like to go for dinner?
I told you I was lactose intolerant.
Hottest one-night-stand I'VE every experienced!
But at least he's not a career politician.
Okay, you're right. Happy now?
'Nothing much. What's new with you?'
Trumpageddon.
Martha, It could be the Russians or It could be a 400 pound guy in New Jersey.
I think we should keep looking.
And to think it all started with a tweet....
Well, we solved that nasty immigrant problem!
What was it you said about my being the last man on earth?
On the bright side, we got out of dinner with The Petersons on Saturday.
"Well, it's been a blast".
Look what you did now, Frank. I told you not to remove the tag from the mattress.
So your lawyer wasn't bluffing.
Mainstream media got it wrong; Trump and Putin weren't as friendly as they thought.
At least we still have ObamaCare until the end of the year
I assume you're going to say this is all my fault again.
Frankly, my life is in ruins.
So, want to rethink that "last man on earth" crack yet?
It depends how you define 'great.'
Gary came by and got rid of the termites.
This therapy session couldn't have come at a better time.
Now is the nuclear winter of our discontent.
Well, at least we are out of debt.
Well, we'll always have Paris.
No, we can't talk about this later.
And that's why you're supposed to use the TV remote, the surround-sound remote, and the Roku remote in the order I taught you.
Why do you say I never notice anything?
I'd love to continue the human race with you but sorry, I think of you more as a friend.
Go on. Say it.
In fairness, it was my first time doing the laundry.
Did you remember to lock the door?
I didn't know making America Great Again meant starting from scratch.
Do you regret not voting?
Apparently the fallout from his latest tweet is, you know, actual fallout.
And you said my vasectomy wouldn't be the end of the world.
Well at least we won!
I told you we should have moved to Canada!
That was close.
At least we were right....
Well, the hotel's website was accurate about being 'close to all the action'...
Still glad you voted for Trump?
Would this be a good week to have your mother visit?
No wonder we could get tickets.
Yes, NOW it's appropriate to call it a meteorite.
The last thing I heard him say was, "What does this shiny button do?"
Well, apocalyptic change was one of his campaign promises...
Why is it MY job to change the batteries in the smoke detector?
Now that I'm the last man on earth...
You say tor-nay-do, I say tor-nah-do.
But what if I WERE the last man on Earth?
Don't worry, President Trump said it wasn't the Russians
April 29, 2017 "And this was just the first 100 days."
Well, Is it great again?
Come to think of it, I did smell gas.
And now we make it great again.
I blame the media
If this is repeal, where is replace?
Okay, you're right. I should have voted for Hillary.
The bus might be a little late today.
When you said you wanted us to start from scratch, this is not what I thought you meant.
Fake news!
Once we get a Starbucks, this neighborhood will be very desirable.
Please don't say "I told you so."
Apparently, we have excellent chemistry.
My wife and I drove in yesterday for the Inauguration.
OK OK Hillary was a better choice.
On the plus side, he did greatly reduce unemployment.
Will your mother be joining us in our post-apocalyptic life?
It looked different on the resort website.
Gesundheit.
Yeah but her emails.
Look on the bright side. No more tweets.
Hillary would've been worse.
On the bright side, there won't be anymore tweets.
I told you our marriage could survive anything.
At least the election is finally over.
Not like it's the end of the world.
Excuse me, you wouldn't happen to have any Grey Poupon?
Have you seen my glasses?
Hi. I'm Joe. I am an alcoholic.
I know. I know. But her e-mails . . .
Okay, okay, you were right. I shouldn't have voted for him.
Okay, I am now the last man on earth. How about it?
Fortunately, my 401(K) is maintained in the cloud.
Okay, you're right. Next time I'll read the instructions.
It looks like Putin turned on him.
Your policy insures against the “zombie apocalypse”, not a regular apocalypse.
You win.
I guess we should have come to D.C. before the inauguration.
Of course I think we should give him another four years.
Well, now that I AM the last man on earth...
It must have been the burrito.
Well, that didn't take very long.
This is going to hurt his brand.
You're right. I should have removed the foil before putting it in the microwave.
I guess we're empty-nesters.
You're blowing this way out of proportion.
Once again, you've ruined everything.
No, really. You were my absolute first choice for the last person on Earth…
'You always said we had too much stuff.'
This is going to negatively affect his brand.
Yes, I'm wearing THIS to an armageddon.
President Trump said that the explosion was fake news so don't believe any of it.
Problems? Yeah. But it's not the end of the world!
I think you better lay low for a while, Meryl.
So now that I am the last man alive on earth, will you marry me?
Well they can't blame us, we didn't even vote!
I'm sure you are going to blame this on me too, right?
I told you he would get the economy booming!
You're the one who voted for change!
Somewhere, somehow, someone's blaming this on Obama.
I told you Ben Carson should not be in charge of HUD
The broker said its a neighborhood in transition...
You're entitled to half.
Remember when Obama was president?
So you're the last woman on earth.
What do you mean, if I didn't vote, I can't complain?
You forgot to change the nuclear codes, didn't you?
I guess the honeymoon's over.
So much for e-harmony.
You're out of excuses. I am the last man on earth.
Yeah, but she's just not likable.
Are we great yet?
To be fair, you did say I'm the last man on earth you'd go out with.
You're right. Elections matter.
I guess it's now up to us to make America great again.
Okay, you have my attention.
Frankly, I liked it better before they drained the swamp.
But what about Hillary's emails?
You get half.
But the point is, we voted our conscience.
Well, we made it to 2017.
I think we need to take a harder look at the Electoral College.
Adam and Eve:The Next Generation
Now you can say "I told you so"
Don't worry, I hear Mexico is going to pay for it.
If you didn't want to cook you should've just said
'You must be Eve'
Well, I hope you're happy little Miss I'm-staying-at-home-and-refuse-to-vote-for-the-lesser-of-two-evils.
Sure, it may not seem important now, but I had to respond to his tweet.
Before you say 'yes' or 'no,' Susan, I'd like to remind you that the alternative is human extinction.
I thought there'd be zombies.
And we all thought Trump and Putin were going to get along
One apocalypse is not the end of the world.
Don't just say it was Russia. It could have been China or a 400-pound guy sitting on his bed.
Maybe it's not as bad as it looks. Let's wait for the tweet.
Happened a lot sooner than I expected
OK, next time I'll vote.
You've always wanted an open floor plan.
Don't worry - they're replacing it soon with something better.
Well, it was great while it lasted.
Well, we did want to spend more time alone.
Do you still expect your mother for dinner on Tuesday?
I still say the emails were the most important issue.
Oh stop whining! It could have been a lot worse. He could have used a private email server.
At least we got rid of Obamacare.
I guess Trump was wrong about being Putin's friend.
Yeah, I know, but she mishandled her emails.
But no, you had to vote your conscience.
America was so overrated. Sad!
Don't look at me, I voted third-party.
I still want a divorce,
It's a bit of a fixer upper.
I'm guessing no second date?
Bless you.
Are you reconsidering your "last man on earth" proclamation?
Okay looking back maybe Trump wasn't the smartest choice...
Yes, I'm sure I got the best seats available.
OK, maybe it was a self-indulgent vote.
Us against the world. I distinctly remember you saying it.
Okay, you were right. Should've moved to Canada.
What a news conference, and he isn't even President yet.
He won. She lost. Get over it.
Sure, but what about her emails?
On the bright side, rebuilding the nation will bring tons of blue collar jobs.
I'm guessing his latest tweet was a doozey.
So, what did you do for living?
I'm still not voting for a woman as president.
Okay, you were right. It WAS the end of the world.
I told you the elections were not the end of the world. THIS is the end of the world.
One person left on Earth and it has to be you
Have you seen my glasses?
Yeah... But the Dow hit 50,000!
How was I supposed to know he would tweet out the nuclear codes?
Don't look at me, you voted for him.
Let's first acknowledge that correlation does not imply causation.
Eve?
So much for Putin being our friend.
I still want a divorce,
So will you go out with me NOW?
It looked better in the brochure.
Good thing we elected "a builder."
I’m sure the second week of the Trump presidency will be better.
I bet you think this is all my fault.
Saying you can't cook would be an understatement.
Now let's make it great again.
We wanted change and I guess we got it.
Come on, darling. It's not the end of the world.
Any plans this weekend?
I thought your family would never leave.
So what do you want to do now?
But she had that email server...
When I first heard about post-apocalyptic dating I was skeptical.
Did you leave the burner on?
Well Eve, it looks like it's just you and me again.
After I insulted him, I thought he would just reply on Twitter!
I think we should stop the newspaper.
Or maybe it was started by a 400 lb. guy sitting in his bed.
You did say we needed to downsize.
He was the lesser of two evils, Martha!
Well, at least we didn't elect a woman President.
I warned you about serving me cabbage rolls.
So.... how was your day?
So how to you feel now about that comment - "not if you were the last man on earth" ?
Look on the bright side. Your mother won't be staying with us for the holidays.
So, do you think you'd vote for him, again?
Where was I?
Well, what do you say? I am the last man on earth.
I see you've gone with the nuclear option.
The place looked better in the brochure.
Oh, like she would've been any better.
I told you this would happen, but NOOOO... You said, "Let's give him a chance."
Honey, you need to lay off the Mexican food.
Now is the time to test out your 'not if you were the last man on earth' theory
Is this your virtual reality or mine?
Can I call you?
So you're going to blame me for this too?
Half-empty, I'd say.
All I said was it looks like you're putting on a little weight.
The service has been a little slow since the World as we knew it ended.
He just tweeted that he is still friends with Putin.
How many times do I have to tell you? It was a protest vote!
I think you overreacted.
Why, specifically, don't you believe he made America great again?
The brochure said ruins; it didn't say old ruins.
Why are you always so negative?
Never underestimate the power of a tweet!
...you renewed the insurance policy, right?
I told you it would take global annihilation for him to stop tweeting!
What were we arguing about again?
At least he didn't use a private e-mail server.
Okay, it's 2:00, should we start the meeting or wait for the others?
Have you seen my keys?
'Let's go to your place instead'
And on the second day of my administration....
Now that I am the last man on earth, I take it your position has not changed?
Not much. How 'bout you?
I followed the instructions to install it. Mostly.
'Only if you were the last man on earth' is a figure of speech!
I rather expected this, but not so soon after the Inauguration.
You have smoldering eyes...
And you thought his inauguration would be boring
I think he actually thought it was a real football.
Are you doing anything Friday evening?
Do you really need to see the prenup, Ted?
Now we know what that button was for.
Looks like we're ALL fired!
I told you not to run the vacuum and the washer at the same time.
Do you think all Trump news conferences will end like this one?
" The radiation gives your face a pleasant glow".
We may be in the middle of a real estate boom.
Have you changed your mind, now that I am in fact the last man on Earth?
Do you still want half?
I wonder if this means we get to keep the library books.
Well, how was he supposed to respond to a Tweet like that?
I swear, if you say 'I told you so...'
It could be worse, it could be raining.
You were the one who said: "Vote for him. What do we have to lose?"
What do you say now that I am the last man?
It's an open floor plan.
So, thats a no?
Somehow, "We still have each other" doesn't quite cut it.
The agent said it's a great place to raze a family.
Well I'm not cleaning it up...
There's just not much left for us to talk about
You just HAD to push the red button, didn't you?
Okay, you were right. I was wrong. Must we fight about this for the next 4 years?
I told you the new president won't affect my life and I'm sticking to it.
Well at least I got rid of the termites.
This is the last time you get to pick a President....
It may not seem it, Delores, but I try to use my powers for good.
I knew Obama should have taken the nuclear codes with him.
Yeah, but her emails, though...
I'm starting to regret voting for Trump
Well that certainly takes care of the immigration issue.
The dating site said you like kittens, quiet walks on the beach and Armageddon.
Yes, I still want the divorce.
I am voting to "Make America again"
You have a certain glow about you.
Were you born here in Detroit?
Compared to 2017, 2016 wasn't so bad.
Fix your make up. CNN will be here any minute.
I hope you're satisfied now that America is great again.
I'm just glad the election's over.
Did you remember to lock the door?
Where'd our waiter go?
Well, that simplifies things.
My sister said they still have a tree in Cleveland.
I can see Russia from my house.
Looks like we won't have to build that wall after all.
If you’re free on Saturday, we should probably start repopulating the earth.
'What's the worst that can happen if we vote for Trump?'" THAT was your question???
How is this is my fault?
Still glad we gave him a chance?
Don't look at me. I wrote in Mitt Romney.
The brochure did say it was a no frills vacation.
That went well.
Can I have the remote?
That was a close one
Ironically, it looks like Twitter is still working...
I suppose it depends on your definition of "Great"
It's still a quiet street.
Alexa: Call 9-1-1.
I liked the book better
You know when you said "not even if we were the last two people on Earth"?
check out was at eleven anyway
I wonder if The Wall is still standing?
Repeat after me - 'America is Great Again'
Well, it is called a reverse mortgage.
I guess Trump really showed Kim Jong Un!
I guess I was angrier than I realized.
Even if the future of the human race literally depends on it?
Well, at least we don't have to argue over who gets the house now...
So that’s what happens when you remove tags that say, ‘Do not remove.’
And what about if I wasn't the last man on earth ?
So .... what's new?
Yes, dear. In hindsight, I should have stopped using my Galaxy Note 7.
Relax, Sylvia. Things always get worse before they get great again.
In his defense, you did make fun of his tiny hands.
I can already feel it starting to gentrify.
Well, so much for "let's give him a chance".
So, now that I AM the last man on Earth...
Okay, you got that out of your system, now what?
I don't care how big that spider was. This is ridiculous.
Will you go out with me now that I AM the last man on earth?
So remind me when we're going to start to "Make America Great Again?"
Remember when I said I wouldn't sleep with you if we were the last two people on Earth?
YES! I VOTED FOR HIM !
I think I'll work from home tomorrow.
Now are you sorry you didn't vote?
It could have been worse
Did you have any trouble with the directions?
I still think she shouldn't have used a private server.
Talk about an empty nest.
On the plus side, he kept his word about lower taxes.
Just give him a chance.
So why don't we start by exploring the origin of your anger.
What do you say, shall we start re-populating?
So much for our reverse mortgage.
So NOW you want to talk?
Maybe Obama wasn't so bad after all.
That's the last time we use TripAdvisor.
I'll be Fred and you be Wilma.
No. I said NOT even if you were the last man on earth.
These aren't the ruins I had in mind.
Well! I'm never pulling *your* finger again!
Think of all the beautiful sunrises and sunsets we'll see without all those buildings in the way.
The name's Adam. And yours?
But on the plus side, everything we now own gives us joy.
I knew we should have voted but you said, what's the worst that could happen.
Well, it looks as though I AM the last man on Earth.
Is it too late for a reverse mortgage?
Okay Marjorie, you hunt and I'll gather but do you really think the glass ceiling should be our priority right now?
I'd like to end things
Next time we vote Democrat.
I know this isn't the best time to say this, Harriet, but I want a divorce.
I said 'Lunch', not 'Launch'.
As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted...
Do you really want to talk about this now?
but her email server...
The brochure said there'd be ruins.
Don't say it
Honestly, I though the inauguration went offer much better than expected.
I thought you told me that losing my job is not the end of the world.
OK: We got under our desks. We put our arms over our heads. We did not look at the flash. Now what?
Well, at least he didn't use his own e-mail server.
I thought he said he knew more than the generals.
Well, it looks like the fat lady has sung.
Really? You're going with, "Even if you were the last man on earth?"
Fine, you plan the next vacation.
So, Sister Kathleen, I guess the human race stops here.
I still say it would have been worse if Hillary had won.
The good news is........ I have started to see someone to discuss my anger issues.
Do you think this will affect the bus schedule?
You voted for him.
Maybe location isn't everything...
Did you remember to turn off the gas?
Tell me again how the emails would have been worse.
well, there goes the neighborhood.
At least the views are unobstructed.
The sunrise tomorrow will be spectacular!
Now you can tell your mother we don't have room!
I'm happier now that we've uncluttered.
Is that your second wish or your third?
Well I guess it could be worse.
I never vote. It doesn't affect my life.
Do you come here often?
On a good note, he promised to rebuild infrastructure
Yeah, but Hillary had emails.
And just who am I supposed to ask for these so-called "directions"?
I never knew the difference between apocalypse and dystopia, till I married you.
....and how many more years is he going to be President?
No, you said it couldn't possibly get any worse.
Now that you ARE the last person on earth, I still won't marry you.
A penny for your thoughts.
All the good restaurants are gone.
Ironically enough, my name is Adam.
Might as well introduce ourselves - I'm Destiny and I'm an alcoholic.
OK, but she lied about her emails!
Is this "de-cluttered" enough for you?
O.K. So, now I am the last man on earth. Will you change your mind?
How was I supposed to know it wasn't a computer game?
You were the one who wanted to switch to gas!
Glad the election's over.
What else was on your bucket list?
I'm loyal, witty, and the last man on earth.
I can't remember if I closed the garage door.
Now I can give you the really bad news.
You are ignoring the fact that our tax rates are now lower.
well that was close!
I said you take me "too seriously" not "to Syria."
You were right, OK? No silverware in the microwave.
On the plus side, the inauguration speech was better than I expected.
No, I did not leave the gas on.
At least we voted our conscience.
I had a feeling January 21st was a bad choice for our first date.
At least we gave him a chance.
You know, I think it was worth it for that brief moment when we were great again.
Still, that went better than expected.
Oh, so now he's MY son?
Is it January 21st already?
I told you that cat was trouble.
Yeah, but what about her emails?
Fine, I respect your decision. But what if I was the last man on Earth?
Should we get take-out?
Remember how you said you will never be with me unless I was the last man on earth
You microwaved the popcorn on the baked potato setting again, didn't you?
It will be great again. Just wait.
I TOLD you not to remove that tag.
Don't be so negative. He says he has a plan.
I'm glad we worked that out.
Did we win?
Well, at least he got rid of Obamacare!
Pizza OK tonight?
Stop overreacting
Alright, now I am the last man on Earth.
I really thought he would be better than Hillary.
Even if I were the last man on Earth?
First, you make it here. Then, you make it anywhere.
But I AM the only man left in the world, Agnes.
I enjoy long walks through the rubble
I told you I couldn't cook
So...What brings you here?
I know we've just met, but I feel it's fate.
Now you're going to say this isn't the change you had in mind.
Let's take another 15 minutes for lunch. I'm pretty sure my boss is out for the afternoon.
Well now that I really am the last man on earth, will you marry me?
When I said 'not even if you were the last man on earth' I meant it.
Well someone left the gas on.
Now repeat after me: Never put foil in the microwave.
I don't care if we are the last two people on earth.
I personally think our first date was a blast.
So it's true what you said about if I was the last man on Earth?
I hope your Trump Twitter joke was worth it.
Well, at least we got Obamacare repealed first.
I told you we didn't need a retirement account or health insurance.
When I started out it was simply my intent to declutter.
So, where are you from?
That last Tweet was a doozy.
I guess I've always considered myself a 'glass half full' guy.
Buy in Kabul, you said. Change of scenery, you said.
Well, now I'm the last man on earth. Your move.
The Times described it as "Airy" and "Unpretentious".
Well, he still has three years and 364 days to make America great!
See, I told you there'd be a place to sit.
Aren't you glad now we didn't spend the money for the kitchen remodel?
Anything else you've been holding back?
Sure, but SHE had an e-mail server!
Yes, Honey, next time I'll call a plumber.
Elections have consequences.
I had better hope for his first 100 days.
They did say we'd see plenty of ruins.
We should get together for coffee sometime.
Now, there you go again, blowing things out of proportion.
Okay, you were right about Trump. Sorry.
I think we need to change travel agents.
They say he's a genius at business
So... what's for dinner.
So, you were saying, if I were the last man in earth what...?
Shall we order out?
Ha! Looks like your mother won't be moving in, after all.
There may be some lingering resentment.
On the bright side, now he can bring back construction jobs
Told ya.
I'm just ONE VOTE, Marjorie. You're not going to pin all of this on me.
Yes, it was repealed, now we await the replacement.
Civilization is overrated.
Should we get take-out?
How was your weekend?
Are you interviewing for the Housing and Urban Development job too?
So America is great again, now what?
Are you free for lunch?
So much for making American great again.
That's the last toaster I get from Walmart.
So what do you think about Trump after one day in office?
Looks like the divorce is final.
About what I expected for Trump's first month.
OK fine, maybe I shouldn't have voted for him.
Not if you were the last man on earth.
I guess this is why the tickets for Trumpworld were half the price of Westworld.
So, shall we get started? The planet's not going to repopulate itself!
Our marriage is the real disaster.
Next time call an electrician.
It's pronounced nuclear not "nuke-you-ler"!
Maybe Mexico will pay for the rebuilding.
OK, OK, you were right. Now are you happy?
Okay, next year we can visit your family.
So, now that I am The Last Man On Earth, whaddaya say?
you win, Chinese tonight
Can we try it my way now?
At least there's no more Mexicans.
Did you leave the stove on again?
I still feel like we didn't get to the bottom of those emails...
Yeah, but what about her emails?
We can still turn this around in the midterms.
I've lost all my passwords.
I just wanted change.
Did you say you would date me if I were the last man on earth?
The ad did say "Fixer Upper".
I'm just not sure this is what the book meant by decluttering.
I'm sorry, but your disaster insurance doesn't cover presidential elections.
I could swear that red button said PUSH FOR LUNCH.
You don't look like your profile picture.
Without a bona fide address, we cannot summit your insurance claim.
I DID follow the instructions!
My bad, I thought you said you would date me if I was the last man on earth.
Come now, you can't possibly be thinking my one vote makes me personally responsible for all this!
Who said downsizing was difficult ?
Where's the remote?
Did you feel the earth move?
You take everything I say and blow it out of proportion!
As a matter of fact, I AM the last man on earth.
As I was saying before all hell broke loose...
No more baked beans for me.
Delicately put, it looks like it's up to us to...you know....
How long are you going to hold my vote for Trump against me?
Well at least we don't have to have your mother over anymore.
Our therapist just cancelled.
Would you if I were the last man in the world?
See? Swamp drained.
I told the Uber driver that we were waiting outside Trump Tower. Do you think we need to call him again?
I'm willing to give you half of the house.
Ikea will deliver the table tomorrow between noon and 6 PM.
There's no one else but you.
Fine. You win.
Well, that’s one way to drain the swamp.
You said you'd only date me if I was the last man on Earth.
NOW can we ask for directions?
Sorry. I didn't mean to blow up like that.
I guess that dinner and a movie are out.
The view is unobstructed.
I don't need to fix that leak after all.
Thank God we got rid of Obamacare
So...do you know why you're in a time-out?
I know we don't agree on much politically...but I for one preferred the "nuclear option" as a metaphor.
Can't you ever look on the bright side?
You were right about Trump comrade. I should never have double dog dared him!
On the other hand, Mexico did pay for the wall.
And you said it wouldn't matter who we voted for...
So how's your January 21st going?
Well, last man on Earth should count for something...
All we wanted was to repeal Obamacare
Nooo, the bet was the wall would go up BEFORE he started World War III.
Sorry I blew up.
This does qualify for my most unusual first date.
Homes explode sometime, it's got nothing to with your mother coming to visit.
I think I left the iron on.
Our relationship is in ruins.
Who's your secretary of housing and urban development now?
You said you would marry me when the world ended. Well?
Well, so much for "Don't worry. The country has survived much worse."
Trump won Get over it.
I think our arguments are becoming too heated.
You asked for unobstructed views.
Does this mean you've done nothing for dinner?
Stop saying, "I told you so."
As of 5 minutes ago, I am the last man on earth. Now will you marry me?
Well, I hate to say I told you so.
But her e-mails...
He thought he was tweeting.
For the last time, I didn't vote for him!
It all started with a tweet.
Okay. I admit that I might have underestimated the damage he could do to our country.
So, what are you doing after the Apocalypse?
And over there used to be the Trump Tower.
I thought Putin liked him.
Hillary would've been worse.
OK, I'll admit it. I am kind of sorry I voted for him.
Maybe you and he just define "great again" differently.
This set, AND an X-rated script? Seriously?
OK, OK. I'm sorry I voted for Donald Trump. There - are you happy now?
Next time you book a vacation, please clarify what "off season" means.
So NOW you want to talk?
OK, so I forgot where I parked. It's not like it's the end of the world.
We just can't afford to abandon a rent-controlled apartment.
We will both laugh about this when we read the captions.
A new year, a clean start!
See? A child must have clear limits.
I suppose this is my fault, too.
I must say this has been my most exciting date in a long while. How about we walk on over to what's left of the cinema?
Look, I'm not the only one who voted for him.
Well, Martha, I'm literally the last man on earth now. Time to call your bluff.
What's it gonna take to admit you were wrong?
Just for once, can we argue without you going for the nuclear option?
Now do you believe me that 20 minutes in the microwave is too much?!
I blame the Electoral College.
Well, on the plus side, no more pundits.
Didn't see this coming when you pulled that lever on Election Day, did you?
I swear I thought he was going to make it great again
In retrospect, I guess improper email protocol was less dangerous than Narcissistic Personality Disorder.
Don't blame me. YOU'RE the one who wanted to make America great again.
Did you remember to lock up?
Don't judge until you see the sunset
It's agreed, then. We'll abolish the electoral college.
Well, that was exciting.
You had to add the jalapenos!
Well as a first date, that was quite exciting
That's true, but he created a lot of jobs getting us here.
Feel the burn?
I don't think it's fair for you to give me that 'I blame you for this look'.
Not even if I'm the last man on earth?
At least we don't have to worry about global warming.
You remember that button you always told me not to push?
Now, can I say, 'I told you so'?
At least Tinder is still working.
YOU are the one who voted to put his stubby orange finger on the red button.
Well, most times I do read the instructions.
At least, we still have our health.
Women just don't understand politics.
Pick you up at seven?
Glad we have made America great again.
Now that I'm actually the last man on Earth, will you reconsider?
You mean "further". "Farther" refers to distance.
How many times have I told you to switch to an iPhone?
Sure, it looks bad now. But I still think we're going to be Great Again.
It’s ok, we are going to make it great again…
I know, I know, you told me not to have the cabbage rolls.
And he's not even in office yet.
I was just hoping to pay less taxes.
We're in a destructive relationship.
Okay, I won't put Mentos in gasoline again.
The question is, are we great again.
At least they repealed Obamacare.
I guess Putin didn't back down.
Well, we won't need dinner reservations.
And to think that only one week ago on this very spot he took the oath of office.
Finally, we'll have something else to talk about beside the children
At least we don't have to tell our future grandchildren that we met online.
What's for dinner? (this is actually by my son Felix, age 8)
Now do you see why your vote matters?
Next time, insist your travel agent explain 'Amazing Ruins.'
Well, maybe I did leave the stove on...
Now will you marry me?
Now? Now he makes it great again.
There goes the neighborhood.
Fine; I was wrong. I guess he CAN do a lot of harm in just four years.
I told you not to order anything delivered by a drone
Then you said, "What could possibly go wrong?"
Well, okay...and what do you think he has planned for January 21st?
I'm tired of picking through the debris of our relationship
...and I say it could have been some 400 pound guy in his bed in New Jersey.
I've never been on a Cinder date.
Okay, okay. Next time I'll read the directions.
I guess we'll see if you stick to your "last man on earth" policy.
Were you serious about not sleeping with me even if I were the last man on earth?
Why couldn't he just send a few nasty twitters?
If this were an episode of the Twilight Zone, you'd be a sexy robot.
Okay, Okay.! Enough with the I-didn't-vote-for-him bit.
Don't blame me, I voted for Bernie.
Come here often?
The agent said "not covered".
At least we didn't vote for someone with a private email server.
Did you say it's January 21, 2017? Well, that escalated quickly.
It's been a brutal divorce. Can we agree on that?
I sense a disturbance in the force.
Sort of a moot point, now.
Donald Trump asked 'What do you have to lose?' and now we know.
You have actually argued with me until the end of time.
Don't look at me- I voted for Stein.
Still happy with your "protest vote", honey?
You could have just told me you wanted more space.
It was that last tweet.
Excuse me, I had beans for lunch.
Yes, he made an unfortunate tweet.
So? You from around here?
Finally, some privacy.
I've been waiting for a good time to talk to you.
So, now how are you feeling about that protest vote?
Don't look at me; I didn't vote for either of them.
OK, OK, I shoulda voted for Hillary!
I told you we should have taken his Twitter away.
I honestly never thought he'd win.
I asked you never to press Control + Alt + Delete
You win. It was rocket science.
Now that I am the last man on earth, can we at least date?
Every Peace Corps experience is different.
So...are you still glad you voted for Trump?!?
Even if I were the last man on Earth?
And I assume you're going to tell me this is all my fault too.
I guess we should update our Linked In status.
Somehow it doesn't seem to matter that we didn't vote for him, does it?
Think I'll run down to Home Depot.
Okay - so, now that I am the last man on Earth. . . ?
Well, that completes our down-sizing.
This is what I mean about your temper.
I still think I can flip it in three months.
But the emails, Barb!
So maybe he'll build the wall on Day Two.
Don't worry. Once they open a Whole Foods, our property value will triple.
It's not you. It's me.
Want to reconsider your "last man on Earth" stance?
Okay, so now we have a third world problem! Does that make you happy?
I wish I'd voted.
I'm still not sleeping with you.
Will you be voting Republican again next year too?
Well I don't care what you say. He speaks his mind, and I respect that.
We may have to reschedule the intelligence briefing.
Give him a chance. He's not even in office yet.
OK, OK. You get the house.
Single level, airy, expansive view, low rent. Yep, that's what the ad said.
Fine, you can't put tinfoil in the microwave. But it still saved us some time.
We should still give him a chance to lead...
Elections have consequences.
We didn't have enough miles for Italy.
Our duty is to repopulate the world. I'm ready now.
I told you I smelled gas.
Would this be a good time to ask you who you voted for?
Let's start over.
It was still a great tweet.
Should we have voted for Hillary?
America's great again.
Yes, but Adam and Eve had a garden.
Still happy with your "Protest Vote"?
I think we're still in the Repeal phase.
I thought they said this building was pre-war?
Well.....I guess you could say that the swamp has been drained
You'll see. This is just the beginning of "making America great again"...
I want a divorce.
Fran, I have to agree with your therapist: you have an explosive temper.
They say they have a plan to replace it.
Now that I actually am the last man on Earth, do you still want that divorce?
At least we still have Social Security...
Sure, but what about her emails?
Well then, your place or mine?
The great part must be next!
Did you hear all that noise last night?
I know, I know, for the thousandth time, you voted for her.
I thought it was just a protest vote.
Well, I'll say we survived our first date okay.
Where did you park?
I'm an interior decorator. What do you do?
I guess it wasn't ,"fake news"
So, that's what the red button on the microwave was for.
"Maybe it's time to see a mediator".
Like my profile said, I have some anger issues.
If you think this is bad, wait until the zombies show up.
Ok, Ok, I should have called the repairman.
Well, that's not what happened in the YouTube Tutorial.
I still say, lock her up!
Well, at least he got rid of Obamacare!
I thought YOU turned off the stove.
But what about those e-mails?
I still say Hillary was worse.
Our marriage is in ruins.
Ironically, now I am the last man on earth!
I don't know. Where do you want to eat?
"I guess we can always sneak across the border to Mexico".
Just got a Tweet from the President -- we won.
The dating scene has really changed.
I still think her emails were a bigger deal.
You're the one who voted for him.
Don't look at me, I didn't vote for Trump.
I thought YOU turned off the stove.
I'll check again for survivors...Watch my seat.
... On top of all that, I'm a claims adjuster.
Look at the bright side. We still have that 20% off coupon from Bed, Bath and Beyond.
Got any plans this evening?
Those hotel deals are never as good as they look in the photos.
It's all Obama's fault.
They are not targeting civilians, we are perfectly safe here.
Next Halloween, let's make sure we don't run out of candy
He said it's all part of the plan. Now Europe will pay for brand new buildings.
At least we have a wall.
If we hire you would you be willing to relocate?
I understand that every marriage hits a rough patch, but it feels like we're living in a war zone.
He said everything he was going to do would be YUGE.
On the plus side, we were right about Trump.
Yeah, but at least that damned Obamacare is gone.
My doctor said, "You have OCD. Stop checking if you left the stove on."
Now you have something to make great again!
Why don't you try this rock, I think you'll find it more comfortable.
Well, at least you still have me.
D-Date
But you're missing the whole point: we won!
And you're sure you unplugged the iron?
Don't blame me I voted for Gary Johnson.
That'll teach those smug elitests
I guess it's up to us to repopulate the world. You want to get started?
...And then Putin said "Sez who?"
The good news? No zombies.
Well, at least now we don't have to worry about climate change.
I still say things would be worse under Hillary.
I'm sure there will be a plausible explanation on Twitter.
I'm just saying, you have shown a tendency to overreact.
I told you not to use bleach and vinegar to clean the toilet.
You have spinach between your teeth.
I told you not to smoke in the basement.
So much for the meteor warning being fake news.
I warned you there was a housing bubble.
I guess this means we are stuck with each other.
In hindsight, I probably should have voted for someone else.
Things look so much better since they drained the swamp
Well, you voted for him!
"Give him a chance," you said. "How bad can he be?" you said. "He'll make America great again," you said.
Yeah, but just imagine how much worse it would be if the Democrats were still in charge.
Perhaps my Twitter feed was a tad bit provocative.
So, are you from around here?
But I miss caption contests the most.
Our insurance policy doesn't cover "scorched earth".
Please stop exaggerating. This isn't a total disaster.
I don't like blind dates. But since we're the last two people on earth, I'll make an exception.
At least we have Obamacare.
I snore.
I was really hoping for someone a bit younger.
I guess Trump called their bluff!
Here's that fresh start you wanted
I guess Russia wasn't as friendly as Trump thought.
The good news is he'll probably be a one-term President.
Would you consider a second date?
OK, I shouldn't have tried to rewire the electrical outlet in the bathroom myself.
So what do you want to do now?
Don't blame me, I voted for Bernie.
Well, maybe white people did have something to lose.
On the plus side, Obamacare has finally been repealed!
No kidding. I voted for him, too.
When you said you wouldn't go out with me if I were the last man on earth, were you speaking literally or figuratively?
Where did you park the car?
Look, I just thought he had some good policies, ok?!
So much for giving him a chance.
Are you up for trying to repopulate the world?
But Hillary deleted a bunch of emails...
Still happy about the protest vote for Stein?
I admit it. We were better off under Obama.
In the plus column, my parents will have to cancel their visit.
This is just the first step of Making America Great Again
I guess telling the President off was a mistake!
Anyway, want to get a drink sometime?
But she deleted some emails.
Well, I guess it depends on your definition of great.
You're acting like this argument is the end of the world.
Well now I am the last man in the world.
Are you sure you turned the oven off?
It was that last Tweet that did it.
Go ahead, say it.
Are you sure these are the Great Again VIP seats?
I just thought he'd mature in office.
"The owners said if we act now we can get in on the ground floor".
C’mon, you hated the wallpaper too.
I don't have much to offer you.
You can stop reminding me who I voted for.
So, about that "last man on earth" comment!
I still think Hillary would have been worse.
I told you that cat was trouble.
Ok, so I voted for the "what's the use of nukes if we don't use them" candidate.
I'm ready to concede that I was wrong about the election.
Pretty good. How about you?
"This is what he means by 'GREAT AGAIN'"?
As I was saying....
Look at the bright side. At least you have the unobstructed view you always wanted.
Now we replace.
We'll always have Pittsburgh.
When you said we'd have a blast, you really meant it.
Sorry that I didn't get around to calling the gas company about that smell.
Do you think it's finally "great" now?
Fine. I'll stop trolling the President on Twitter.
Let's eat out tonight.
How about if I was the last man on scorched earth?
They dropped it, why can't you?
Let me guess: I'll be sleeping on what's left of the couch tonight.
Is this what you meant when you said: 'Let's start over again'?
Well! At least we have each other.
At least we found seats next to each other.
You don't think America's great again?
Oh stop complaining. He won. Let's just give him a chance.
You never take me anywhere nice.
Well the media did not predict this would happen.
Let's hope this is the best E-Harmony match ever.
Welcome to 2017.
Well, Burt, you somehow topped our honeymoon in Bosnia ...
See, Trump's first week wasn't so bad.
Now that I actually am the last man on Earth, how about that coffee?
'You're disappointed, I can tell. I admit, my profile picture was taken pre-apocalypse.'
Yes, it's the end. Yes, the answer is still "No."
The tweet read 'Sad. No way it could be the Russians.'
OK, I took the lumpy rock. What else do you want?
Well, yeah, if the election were held today, sure..."
I already said I'm sorry I voted for him.
But what about her emails?!!
At least we have each other.
When he said, 'Make America Great Again,' I missed the part about starting from scratch.
Any other ideas for avoiding the next four years?
You shouldn't have pulled my finger.
Still better than Hillary.
The timing for your acceptance of a woman president is just a little late, Phil.
Oh don't be so smug
Let's start over.
Remember when you said, "If I was the last man on earth?"
In hindsight, perhaps we should have voted for Hillary
l'm beginning to regret my vote.
Next year I choose the vacation!
Maybe Obama wasn't so bad.
2016 is looking better with each passing day.
I can hardly recognize the old neighborhood.
Now we really need someone to make it great again.
Is now a bad time to ask if I should take a Viagra?
And I was just starting to feel great again...
And then I remembered what my ex-wife constantly told me - "Never put metal in the microwave!"
To think it all started with a tweet...
No, really Eve, my name is actually Adam.
I blame your mother.
It turns out he did make America disintegrate again.
I know it isn't great again but it's not grounds for impeachment.
Why do you always have to make it about the apocalypse?
You're right, voting for Trump was a bad idea.
Alright, I was wrong about President Trump.
Hi. My name is Adam.
Hell hath no fury...
Is that lipstick on your collar?
I miss the old neighborhood.
In retrospect, maybe we shouldn't have voted for Jill Stein.
This is absolutely the last time we use a Russian travel agent.
WW III - It's a good thing we weren't home when it happened.
Do you want the short version or the long version?
No more "Do it yourself" YouTube videos.
Next time vote democratic
Some all-expenses-paid vacations just aren't worth it.
This is Kansas, Dorothy... What did you expect?
Turns out having a roof over my head was a large part of your appeal.
I'm the last man on Earth. Now will you go out with me?
All I said was that his hands seemed unusually small.
Maybe we should give couples therapy a rest.
We should try to patch things up.
Well I guess that just leaves you and me.
Isn't tonight sex night?
Yes, I voted for him--so what?
That's why it's called research & development.
You can stop worrying that you left the stove on, Mildred.
I'm rethinking my Trump vote.
Not even if we were the last two people on Earth, huh, Carol?
Really? Armageddon was my fault?
Honey, you'll never guess what happened today...
And if I WAS the last man on earth?
So, are you going to vote for Trump again in 2020?
Well at least he didn't have a private email server.
I guess Kim Jung-un called The Donald's bluff.
Fake news! It didn't happen. Sad.
I thought you said you turned the stove off.
Now aren't you glad we didn't buy?
Which house was Alec Baldwin's?
Did you shut off the oven?
Is it not uncanny that my name is Adam and that yours is Eve?
The instructions came in every language but English.
What was it you said? Not even if I was the last man on Earth?
I can't get over how cheap our flights were!
At least now we have one less thing to worry about.
I know You don't want to hear it again, "there goes the neighborhood."
We got our guy elected, didn't we?
At least we still have our health care plan.
Well you're nothing like your profile pic, Mr "lastmanonearth69" but I guess you'll have to do.
Okay, I should have voted!
I wonder what would've happened if Russia hadn't been our friend...
Well, you're the one who voted for him.
Was that necessary - just to keep my mother from visiting?!
I imagined ‘airy with historic views’ differently
Well, that was one of the rougher therapy sessions I've had.
If this is the end of civilization as we know it, at least that means he won't be re-elected.
At least he did something in the first hundred days.
Were your flights non-refundable too?
So, I'm guessing your mother won't be coming now?
Their calling it the 'tweet heard round the world'
Can you hear me now?
We made it through hell unscathed, now brace yourself for high water.
No, it's definitely not half full.
I guess this means we live with your mother now.
Now that I AM the last man on earth, are you sure you won't change your mind?
There is still the question of attorney fees.
Well, clearly, but you voted for him, too.
I didn't promise you a rose garden.
No, I don't know where the LGBT bathrooms are.
So, are you still so certain you wouldn't date me if I were the last person on the face of the Earth?
I told you that giving the nuclear codes to a former reality TV show host was a bad idea.
Ok, I did leave the stove on.
Now will you sleep with me?
OK, maybe deplorable.
Are you happy now? I was wrong again - it IS the end of the world.
I thought we'd at least make it passed January 21st...
Or we could've just called an exterminator
Why don't we just order out?
So what if I WAS the last man on earth?
... And then someone called him a Cheeto for the very last time
Don't look at me like that, you are the one who voted for him.
Go on, say it. I ruin things for everyone.
What do you mean, I should have read the directions first?
So what do think of our new president?
I was right. Hell didn't freeze over.
My mother always told me you were a homewrecker.
Sadly we are not in love among the ruins.
I told you not to put aluminum foil in the microwave
You're the one who insisted on the 20 year mortgage.
Everywhere your mother goes its the same!
What would you like to keep in the divorce?
Things could be worse.
It's all your fault.
OK, maybe his last tweet was a LITTLE too provocative.
I was told to cut the green wire.
Four more years?
You said you weren't concerned about his foreign policy.
So that's why they called it Tinder.
I don't understand. the brochures said Aleppo is lovely this time of year
The Donald tweeted a photobomb challenge to Vlad - and and it was downhill from there.
He said that it had nothing to do with the fact that we didn’t vote for him. He said they were showing him the button and his little hand slipped.
Please listen carefully, as our menu options have recently changed.
He said literally but, I didn't think he meant literally.
I see this as a unique buying opportunity.
Do you remember me saying 'The world may end, but our love will last forever...'
Oh! Carol! I feel the earth move under my feet!" "Oh! Neil! I feel the sky tumbling down!
So? You from around here?
Why didn't you tell me that you'd never changed a fuse before?
Well I'm really glad we gave Trump a chance! ...Now what?
OK, OK... But I still think she lied about her emails.
I don't care what you say, I feel great again.
Well, you got your wish for no more obnoxious neighbors.
I thought the directions said to pre-heat oven to 3500 degrees.
Didn't see that one coming.
No, honey, I still would not vote for Hillary.
Ok, who's ready to repopulate the earth?
Any thoughts on dinner?
"Not if I was the last man on earth," really?
Okay fine, I admit it. I should've voted for her.
Don't worry, the hipsters will move in soon.
It was your idea to use the travel agent from Kabul
I'd say we still have each other, but frankly that doesn't do it for me.
Noah started with less.
The city bus may not be coming, want to try Uber?
Fox News didn't see it coming.
At least this will deter the immigrants.
I knew the play bombed, but I didn't think the critics would go this far.
OK, but his Supreme Court pick was awesome.
But he repealed Obamacare.
You just couldn't wait to use the nuclear option in this argument, could you?
All things considered, how do you like the neighborhood?
O K you win.
I told you I can't cook!
Looks like I AM the last man on earth.
There's 'repeal'. I'm waiting for 'replace'.
Well, at least the Mexicans paid for that wall.
Think of it as our very own Waiting for Godot moment.
This is why we can't have nice things.
Now I'm glad we didn't pay the gas bill
Next on the list, Social Security.
The last one ever, but a helluva tweet.
On the bright side, Trump was only a one-term president.
I like this place because it hasn't been gentrified.
No, I don't think this apocalypse makes you look fat.
Beans and cabbage for dinner, and then you light a cigarette !
I just want to be sure you're actually the last man on Earth.
Anything new going on with Kim and Kanye?
Now that I AM the last person on Earth, you still won't talk to me?
I'll give up the seat when your friend arrives.
On second thought, maybe I did leave the coffee maker on.
So we gave him a chance. Is it ok to ask now if we made a mistake?
I didn't vote for the guy.
Finally, it's just the two of us.
No, I still won't move to the suburbs.
So what do you wanna do after this?
The next time you want to play with the grandkids we're going to their house!
Well...now that I actually AM the last man on earth, how about dinner?
I told you to get rid of your Samsung.
Well, we still own a piece of the rock.
We could be in the middle of a real estate boom.
I told you we didn't need reservations.
The people have spoken.
You can't say he wasn't effective. Race, immigration, employment, trade and health care aren't problems anymore.
You had to give the kids a chemistry set.
I thought I'd be wearing something edgier after the apocalypse.
Tell me again how this is great?
Should we repopulate?
Perhaps you'll be a little lerss condenscending now that I really am the last man on earth.
'I don't care. I'm still not staying at your mother's.
Next year, I'll choose the vacation destination.
I don't have any of my usual first date jitters
My point is, it's a lot easier to make something great again if you completely destroy it first.
You were right—I should have voted for Hillary.
Don't look at me. I didn't vote.
I still say 2016 was worse.
I chase storms Helen, it's what I do.
Did you remember to unplug the iron?
But if you put aside the retaliation, you have to admit that it was one of Trump's best zingers.
That's amazing -- I was raised by a post-apocalyptic mutant motorcycle gang too!
Not even if you were the last person on Earth.
Let's give him the benefit of the doubt.
"Great" is a subjective word I guess.
Well, now that I am the last man on earth, I'll give you one more chance to reconsider.
Not to say I told you so, but that didn't take long
On the bright side at least nuclear winter will balance global warming.
Now it will be even more fantastic when he makes America great again.
Did you remember to turn off the lights?
"What's your favorite home renovation show"?
Did you unplug the coffee pot?
I guess a "hot" real estate market can mean two different things.
Didn't take long for America to be 'Great Again'.
I hate it when a neighborhood gets discovered.
I love what you've done with the space.
Do you think the parade is still on?
I guess I thought that the apocalypse would be more...something.
When I said, 'Let's vacation in Damascus', I meant Maryland.
I pulled the lever in the voting booth and next thing you know.....
I'm Adam. What's your name?
So, you still feel good about that protest vote?
One day after inauguration and here were are.....
Look at the bright side. Your mother can't come.
I think we should try mediation.
Ok, fine. That "Holiday in Aleppo" brochure may have been a bit out-of-date.
Was that a definite "no?"
Do you still think they were right to take away his Twitter account?
I told you over and over again we were on the eve of destruction.
You're my ex. So, at least we don't still have each other.
At least we're still in Kansas.
It's a metaphor.
Being married to you is still worse.
Bad news, Ruth. It's no longer a seller's market.
Love is a battlefield.
How's 'Not if you were the last man on earth!' working for you now?
Think you had enough cognac in the flambé?
I think an Ikea run.
You can't make me move. This block is rent controlled.
Did you check the radiation levels before we left?
OK, maybe we should have tried mediation.
I guess we'll never have Paris
Fine, I'll admit it. I passed some gas.
I told you the article about the meteor wasn't Fake News!
I guess he thought the Stone Age was great.
You want to reconsider? Because it now looks like I am the last man on Earth.
You're right, I shouldn't have fought you so much over the thermostat.
I was hoping we'd at least make it until the inauguration.
That was some sneeze.
Alright, so I left the oven on.
Why do you always blame me when something goes wrong?
Well that couple's therapy session ended well.
We stay...I refuse to learn another language!
You and your 'Off-Season Rates'!
I was very happy with our simple, ordinary life, but then you had to convert to gas.
Fine -- so my mother's visit was, in fact, the end of the world.
This approach worked in the campaign.
This could have happened just as easily if she was president.
Obama was right-there are no red states or blue states.
You told your lawyer to go nuclear. Happy now?
So, is America Great Again yet?
I am the last man on earth.
I guess elections do have consequences.
I say we give it one half of one star on TripAdvisor.
I have an idea for a home renovation reality show.
...And so I said to myself, what a wonderful world.
So, does that whole "Not if you're the last man on earth" thing still count.
Well, I STILL wouldn't have voted for Hillary because of her emails.
So he won. It's not the end of the world.
Tell me again about how elections don't matter.
I'm having second thoughts about voting for Donald Trump
The box said it was safe for boys 10 to 15.
I didn't think "scorched earth policy" applied to us.
You can't expect to make America great again if you aren't willing to ruffle a few feathers.
Could be worse. They could have seated us by the kitchen.
"Well, I think it's only gong to be a four year term".
At least we have our health.
Okay, you were right. I should have read the directions.
Homewrecker!
It's just like you to always look at the dark side.
Say "great" again, I dare you.
Henry, you've ruined everything.
OK, we've de-cluttered. Are you happy now?
Ok now I agree with you about Trump
It's the first step of his jobs program.
You started it.
Yes, there is a learning curve when making your own fireworks.
Yeah, but Hillary was a crook.
Unless you have your proof of insurance, I'm afraid I can't help you.
We should have voted for Hillary.
Well, I've always done the cooking, and you've always done the picking up.
I don't see any reason to go to work today, do you?
Ready to repopulate?
Told you to cut the BLUE wire!!
You have to admit . . . the Mexicans did build a fantastic wall.
Did you have to look so disappointed when I said, 'at least we still have each other'?
Should we cancel the lawn care service?
Could be worse. Could be snowing.
No, Fred, you may not call me "Wilma," now.
So what time is your mother coming?
Oh oh. Did I turn the oven off?
You used hotels.com again, didn't you Frank?
Your profile said that you are an optimist.
Yes, but Hillary would have been even worse.
Oh, like Hilary would have done any better.
Look at the bright side. Now we don't need to make room for your mother.
Ok, maybe I'm second guessing my vote a little....
Let's not go to sleep angry.
Fine, I admit it: casting a protest vote was a mistake.
Your mother seemed to enjoy her visit.
No one said making it great again was going to be easy.
Ok. I guess I should have voted differently.
"Remember when I said I wanted to see other people?
I should have thought more before voting
When I ignore the present and forget the past, I really think our best times are ahead.
Remember what Kellyanne Conway said about seeing the goodness in his heart?
" Don't worry we still have all that money in our 401K'
So you don't think we'll get our deposit back?
Alright. Perhaps it was a bit of an overreaction.
I am still proud to have a President that represents me!
I see no earthly reason to wait any longer for the cable guy. Gladys.
"My beans won't give you gas", you said.
OK, I admit I voted for him.
While it WAS a load-bearing wall, I think we can both agree this really opens up the space.
I guess this means we can skip couples therapy.
Oh well, we've survived worse.
'Please call me Adam'
We still need to give Trump a chance.
Maybe I was wrong about the world not coming to an end if we skipped dinner with your sister.
Honest. All I did was ‘like’ Alec Baldwin’s impersonation of Trump.
Actually, a verbal description of our marriage would have sufficed.
We must have different definitions of the word "great."
Well, that's that with our reverse mortgage plans..
Yeah, but we won! Didn't we?
Just think of this as an opportunity. We needed a new water heater anyway.
I'm not convinced we should abandon the electoral college just yet.
We need to talk
I hope that cockroaches are an acquired taste.
well, I am the last man on earth, can we have a date?
I guess Trump' first term wasn't too bad.
Ah. alone at last!
Still glad you voted for Trump?
But her emails though.
Now this is deplorable.
He did say he was going to decrease the size of the government.
It's my vote, and I don't regret it.
Do you smell gas?
You just couldn't wait the five minutes before trying to relight the grill.
On the contrary, Ira, I think it's the perfect time to discuss the bathroom remodel.
Do you think it's too late to refinance?
Well at least we can finally cancel our E-Harmony accounts.
You said my vote wouldn't matter.
Please, no more beans at supper.
You were right. I shouldn't have voted for him.
That was a disaster.
Can we talk now?
So...I'm guessing you used to live around here?
See? Great again.
But now we can make it great again!
You're sure you read the terms & conditions?
Ok, ok - I'm listening.
As I've said all along, not even if you are the last man alive.
Is there someone else?
Well, you always told me things could be worse.
Well, I heard from some very reliable sources that a brand new affordable medical plan will be offered in only two more days.
I guess ordering a pizza is out.
And if I had asked for directions, it would have 'avoided all this' how, exactly?
Should I focus on asset growth or wealth preservation?
Hey, I didn't vote for him either.
You know what? It’s about time we had a President who’s not afraid to shake things up.
I think we both agree now, cooking is not your forte.
Well I don't think Hillary would have done any better.
If you say, "let's start from scratch," I'll kill you.
As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted...
Marry me and half is yours.
Are you available to re-populate this afternoon?
Make the wasteland great again.
Okay, Okay! Yes. I voted for him.
And you still think it was okay to vote for that man..?!
All those years of eating paleo might actually help us.
Maybe buying the pressure cooker wasn't such a good idea.
This is why you don't stick a knife in the toaster.
'' I liked your pre-apocalyptic stare better than I like your post."
See, I told you everything would be okay.
I didn't realize there was a nuclear option for decluttering."
Thank you for giving him a chance.
And what brings you to speed dating?
Beats 2016.
Okay, I really know that you're pissed off.
When I voted for him to shake things up, this isn't what I had in mind.
Don't blame me. I didn't vote for him either.
Not if you were the last man on earth.
So, you still think Trump will be re-elected?
Oh, well, at least he didn't use a private e-mail server.
Why not just level with me?
At least Hillary Clinton isn't president
Do you have any plans for Saturday night?
Now THAT is what I call a fart!
I feel like that really cleared the air
Hey, even a licensed electrician could've made the same mistake.
NOW do we have room for a pool table!?!
Next time, get out and vote!
Remember when you said, "I would never. Even if you're the last man on earth." Well...
Did you remember to record Game of Thrones?
Well, Sue, it looks like I'm the last man on Earth.
I had a rough day. What's for dinner?
What? Sorry, hon, I wasn't listening.
You're sure you sent in the premium ?
Let's just order takeout.
You said you were looking for something in a pre-war building?
You look just like your profile picture.
Do you think its a coincidence that my name is Adam, Eve?
At least he kept half of his campaign promise.
Up till now, my first dates tended to be duds.
So you're the last woman on earth.
I hope I don't step on my glasses!
I agree her handling of e-mail doesn't seem like that big of a deal, in retrospect.
Everything seems to quiet down after the holidays.
Damn Right! And I would vote for him again!
I'm not moving until you say, "I'm sorry."
Pizza or Chinese?
Let's go out for dinner.
Okay, maybe that slogan should have been "Make America Again".
See, not everything is fake news!
Let's eat out instead.
Had we added an 'acts of war' rider we'd be sitting pretty.
I dunno. What do you want to do?
Survivors can't be choosers!
Let's not start over.
Madam, I'm Adam
Oh, so it's my fault?
Yes, but I didn't think he'd really do it.
Well. OK. But let's look at the positive side.
Okay: I was wrong to tell you not to worry about the oven.
Tell me again how this is "not the end of the world."
I still think we should give him a chance.
I told you this would happen. Well maybe not this, but something.
They're saying to cut the new Administration some slack.
Don't look at me like that. I didn't vote for him.
Surely they knew #DrainTheSwamp was a metaphor.
You just had to send that tweet about Trump's haircut!
A penny for your thoughts.
Hey! I'm not the one who voted for him!
I told you we should have moved to Canada!
How was I supposed to know a politician was going to do exactly what he said he was going to do?
Okay, so maybe I shouldn't have given a damn about Hillary's email.
I still don't want to meet your mother.
Honestly....Netflix is what I miss the most.
Ok dear, maybe I should try the Acidophilus.
I bet you feel some guilt NOW over pushing so hard for the vasectomy.
You knew I had a temper when you married me.
I still think it's Hillary's fault.
But you voted to change the landscape!
And I thought the election results were a disaster
I tell you I don't care. What do YOU want to do for dinner?
Still glad you voted for him?
Oh c'mon, we've got front row seats.
I TOLD you not to use foil in the microwave!
Does it really matter if I don't put the toilet seat down?
It's a good time to buy. We're expecting the area to gentrify.
Well,you don't see any more swamps,do you?
Don't you love the peace and quiet?
And I supposed you would like to blame this on me as well
Not much. What's new with you?
How ironic is it that now there's peace and quiet.
You want to go for a bite?
They'll give us the replacement plan any day now.
Just think how worse it would be if Hillary had been elected.
Want to move in with me?
Sorry I forgot to remove the lint from the dryer.
Do you wanna maybe rethink when you said, 'Not if you were the last man on Earth'?
I thought you knew how to cook.
location,location,location
Who woulda thought making us great again meant starting from scratch?
I'm ready to discuss a cease-fire.
Not with a bang or a whimper, after all, but a tweet.
Yeah, but can you imagine how much worse it would've been if we elected somebody who was AGAINST Russia?
Wanted peace, but got quiet instead.
So, apparently this place used to be a swamp.
Okay - this one is my fault.
Next time, let's not invite your sister.
Alright. We'll go out for dinner.
I told you the phrase "Great Again" was subject to interpretation.
I'm now thinking we should have voted for Hillary.
I never really liked this place, anyway.
They bombed our house to make America great again?
Maybe we should try divorce mediation, after all.
But SHE used a private email server!
I suppose you think I had something to do with this?
I forget - you would or you wouldn't if I was the last man on earth?
all i said was pull my finger
I don't care if you are the last man on earth, I don't want to get married.
But what if Godot doesn't come?
Hi, my name is Adam. Mind if I call you Eve?
Then I said "I double dare you!"
I'm an optimist, so I would call it the "beginning of nights"
In times like these, we need marshmallows.
Our divorce was hard on everyone.
Did you remember to turn off the bathroom light?
Madam, I'm Adam
Had to vote for him, didn't you?
So this is what's at the bottom of a swamp.
Now that the swamp's been drained, what's next?
Well, now we know.
I'm sorry.
So much for the presidential honeymoon.
We can check that off our bucket list.
Contemporary is out. Apocalyptic is in.
I always fantasized about this moment but with palm trees and sand.
"We'll always have Aleppo.
Well, there should be plenty of jobs now.
Well, now your only choice for a date IS the last man on earth.
I have an idea for a Twilight Zone episode.
It's amazing what you can accomplish with a tweet.
Should we order in?
"Vote for him", you said. "He'll make America great again", you said.
So, what is it you wanted to talk about?
Are you saying we don't have each other?
...did I mention all the natural lighting?
I'm sorry but Your policy doesn't cover 'total devastation'.
Great, now there's no one behind the DMV counter.
But Hillary's emails...
Should we say something?
Point taken.
All in all, the first week of the new administration could have been worse.
I can't wait for Season 2!
....and this was just day one of the new administration.
Oh come on, 2016 wasn't that bad.
Remember, we elected him.
A minor setback. He's still going to make America great again!
Sad!
I hope the New Yorker's cartoon caption is not yet another obvious reference to Donald Trump
The label clearly said 'Dry Clean Only.'
His cap needs a new slogan.
You were right, I shouldn't have pushed that button.
Flatulence!" "What flatulence?
I want a trial separation
Not much. You?
Actually, it IS the end of the world Frances.
Where shall we go for lunch?
Well, he saved those Indiana jobs from going to Mexico, didn't he?
So, I guess the meeting's off?
Let's not try to repopulate the world.
I'm Evan. I'm the last man on Earth. And you are?
I think we can qualify for a lower real estate tax assessment.
Maybe not your dream vacation, but it's affordable.
Maybe voting for Trump was a bad idea.
Okay, fine. We'll do it your way.
Now will you listen to me?
You probably don't have to deal with my mother any more.
So, we're agreed, direct election of the president, if we find any more survivors.
I'm still not going to date you.
How was traffic?
This never happens when my family visits.
I guess all that's left is football and mixed martial arts.
You first
I understand. But, what's for dinner?
I think this gives us a chance to start over.
Personally, I prefer the hole in the ground a couple of blocks over.
You free tonight ?
Don't blame me. I voted for Hillary.
We were lucky to have these seats.
So, about that 'last man on Earth' thing ...
I wonder if, in retrospect, he regrets tweeting, 'Go ahead, make my day.'
Maybe we should consider a new anger management counselor.
This gives a whole new meaning to 'starting over'......
Honey, the points were going to expire if we didn't use them.
Well, there's no one else to nag now.
I warned you what a careless tweet could do.
Does it change your mind that I am the last guy left?
You never should've made fun of his hands.
You said, and I quote, "affordable timeshare, with plenty of warm sun."
Let's time travel to the future, you said. It will be a magical utopia, you said.
I blame Nixon.
What's that perfume you're wearing?
I like missionary. You?
Don’t ever insult Melania again.
Don't give me that look.
Greatness begins with a clean slate.
I think the divorce is going quite well, don't you?
Are you waiting for the bus too?
I guess you were serious when you said you wouldn't have sex with me if I was the last man on Earth.
Nope, now is not a good time to talk about us.
OK, I take back what I said about if we were the last people on Earth.
I suppose I never really considered the ramifications of voting to "shake things up."
I still think she was hiding something in those emails.
Between you and me...
I meant it when I said, "not even if you were the last man on earth."
Finally, alone, just the two of us.
Make America great again. Step 1. Blow it up.
We'll always have Manhattan.
But those emails...
So... what's for dinner.
Technically dear this IS the last place on Earth
He said that The Button was so small, he mashed it with his elbow when he took the call from Putin.
Somewhere, Hillary Clinton is saying, "I told you so."
On the bright side, there will be no traffic going home.
What are we saving the good china for?
'Lucky you. Now I am the last man on earth.'
I wouldn't marry you if you were the last person on Earth.
I've always wanted to start from scratch.
Give him a chance, would you? He's only been in office for a week.
Did you hear that ?
I still don't regret my vote.
See? I told you voting for him wouldn't matter. We're just fine.
You're right, it's not that great.
So, how has YOUR January 21st been?
Does it also mean that tragedy equals comedy minus time?
Now aren't you glad that we didn't buy that expensive rug.
At least he's using the right e-mail server.
He did say he'd shake things up.
Yes, I still don’t like her; and no, I would not change my vote now.
Well, thank God for those emails! Just imagine the fix we'd be in if Hillary had won.
No, I never got around to watching the final episode. So you wouldn't be spoiling it.
I never imagined that "Make America Great Again" required a complete makeover.
Speed dating rules, okay?
I suggest we stop here and save the rest for our therapy.
Don't look at me ; I didn't vote for him.
We should have agreed to negotiate.
And that's why there was an electoral college
Where do you want to scavenge for dinner?
Not smitten. Smote.
I'll see what the deductible is on our policy.
It has to get bad, before it gets 'great again'!
So, do you think the bus will be on time?
Don't blame me. I voted for Her
"Well, I guess that's that".
Okay. Now getting back to Hillary's e-mails.
Now will you stop smoking!
I understand real estate is very cheap here in Aleppo.
They claim his finger slipped when he gave someone the bird.
Well, I guess it is a little ironic that I was stockpiling gasoline, explosives and kitchen matches in anticipation of an apocalypse.
What's a nice girl like you doing in a post-apocalyptic world like this?
Ok, I'll grant you the weather does seem to be changing.
Okay, I admit it: I shouldn't have kept saying, 'That's only what he says, not what he means.'
How is this is my fault?
Hillary should have campaigned in Wisconsin
Isn't our second date a little early to start talking about repopulating?
Adventure and frugal were the only guidelines you gave me on picking our vacation Muriel.
It's not the end of the world, Eve.
Unfriending them just wasn't enough.
I guess now there is no longer a need for The Wall.
At least he drained the swamp...
I'm starting to think the liberal elites were right about Trump.
You are using the word "literally" wrong.
I thought retirement would have more to offer.
Well, at least the neighbor's dog won't wake you up in the morning.
I think the Russians hacked TripAdvisor
I don't feel great. Do you feel great?
Well, in order to make it great again we had to destroy it.
Next time, let's just talk.
There you go again. Did you even hear a word I said?
On the bright side ,we won't have to keep up or even put up with the Joneses any longer.
What kind of name is Eve 2.0?
I'm still not over the emails.
The people have spoken.
Are you still voting Trump again in 2020?
I was right! It took only one week for Trump to blow up the world. You said it would take a month.
These aren't the ruins they mentioned in the guide book.
how the fuck is this my fault
It was impossible to get a table.
Good thing you canned all that salsa.
I told you his Tweet would cause this.
She’s a sore loser but she plays an impressive trump card.
Now that I am the last man on earth, do you want to reconsider that date?
I know we did it to other countries, that doesn't mean they should've done it back, Barb.
See honey, I told you everything would be fine.
Alright already, no more gas furnace repair correspondence courses.
Can I call you Eve?
Now then, where were we?
"I'm still glad I voted for him".
I told you voting for Trump was a mistake.
I told you I had a gluten allergy.
OK, I admit I voted for him.
Do you think the buses have stopped running?
This neighborhood will only get better.
Well, do you know any restaurants on the west side?
This is not what I thought he meant by "great"
Okay! You win! I should have gone with Hillary!
Well, hindsight is always 2020, but I still think 'Make America Great Again' was an appealing concept.
Yeah but her emails.
Alexa, cancel armageddon.
Well, that’s one way to drain the swamp.
I'd vote for him again.
But you did say, 'Whatever it takes to get rid of the rats'—and now you've changed your mind?!
I told you we should have been listening to the weather channel.
I know you said "not if you were the last man in the world." I hoped maybe you had reconsidered.
How about next year we skip the Historic Aleppo tour?
We've been through worse. Remember Trump?
Marcy, it's over.
I'm quitting smoking tomorrow.
You can't blame this one on my mother.
Bomb shelters are so 50s, you said.
You win! It only took two weeks since he was inaugerated.
Is it really the end of the world if I don't visit your mother?
Don't worry dear, Trump will eventually get the hang of it.
Yes, I promise I'll never try to make dinner for us again, Dear.....
Don't worry - fake-news
For the hundredth time, I'm sorry I forgot our anniversary.
I doubt we'll see a taxi for a while.
I don't understand. The bus is usually right on time.
I can't think of anything funny, either.
OK, fine. He didn't make it great again.
You always said not even if you were last man in the world. Care to reconsider?
What makes you so sure it was Russia?
Ok, NOW your mother can't stay with us.
Where do you see yourself in five years?
He won. She lost. Get over it.
Honey, this is all they have in our price range.
Al Roker was sure off base with this one
Don't ever light up a cigarette after judging a Chili cook off.
I still think Hillary shouldn't have had a private email server.
I'm glad we spent all that time on choosing drapes.
Is this what he meant by "Making America great again?"
So...would you sleep with me now?
Well, at least we didn't vote for the candidate with the private email server
Is this a bad time to tell you I cancelled our homeowner's insurance to pay the health insurance deductible.
Honey, I don't think this has anything to do with my leaving the toilet seat up.
I told you it would blow over.
Looked like a little innocent drone to me.
If we give President Trump another four years, I'm sure he'll turn things around.
But Hillary had a private email server!
Minor side effects are to be expected when making America great again.
But what were you cooking?
I thought he said he was going to make America great again.
So what do you think of Trump now?
That thing you said about 'Not even if you were the last man on Earth.' Did you mean it?
Finally, America is great again.
No, you're the one who said, 'Vote for Trump. What could go wrong?'
I'm still peeved about those emails.
So now I suppose we can put your Degree in Dystopian Literature to good use?
It could have been worse
I think our side won.
I love what you've done with the space.
I blame fake news.
At least now, Trump will not be reelected.
So, are we thinking pizza tonight?
You can't beat the taxes.
You should have been here yesterday
I thought you turned off the coffeemaker.
Just think of all the celebrity deaths.
So, should I cancel my vasectomy appointment?
Have you been on many other first dates lately?
What community property?
I wonder what's holding up the bus this time.
I suppose your'e going to blame THIS on me?
So, you said if we were the last two people on earth...
Feel better now?
Let's just put it out on the table that neither of us would be our first choice to repopulate the planet and go from there.
I think that this vacation was a total disaster.
Ok, Ok. You were right that it was dangerous to let him near the button.
Really. It's up to us to repopulate.
Sure, but SHE had her own email server
I bet I know who you voted for.
I'm sorry I clicked on that link.
Why do we always have to bring other people into our fights?
At least we don't have to visit your folks this summer.
I was just trying to surprise you with dinner . . . and then Whoosh!
I liked him. He said what was on his mind.
At least you don't have to deal with my clutter anymore.
Yes, but emails.
Do you think someone will do something about the election now?
He's running for a second term.
Next time let's follow the instructions!
I'm sorry about the souffle
What's the burning issue this time?
So "Ms. I'm-voting-for-Jill-Stein," happy?
"Fine. Next time, I'll consider voting Democrat.
We're HERE dear, and we are NO WAY paying a cancellation fee!
Split a cab?
Next year, I'm voting for the Democrat.
So, I voted for him, so, sue me.
He tweeted WHAT about Vladimir?
That was one hell of a Tweetstorm
This isn’t the post-election outcome I voted for!!
Well, I hope the 2020 Inauguration event is better than this one.
Thirsty?
The Trumpet did sound!
Now that we got that out of the way.
Apparently, 'DRAIN THE SWAMP' was a metaphor.
I wonder how my 401k is doing?
I thought he would be good for the economy.
You said you wanted a disruptive change
... but you can call me Adam.
Okay, so maybe I shouldn't have voted for Jill Stein.
You always said, "only if we were the last people on earth"...
Now he can deliver on his infrastructure-spending promise.
You voted for him, not me.
You have to break a few eggs to make America great again.
Wow, that must have been some tweet!
It's been a blast, Helen, but I'm outta here!
I see you're not wearing your 'Make America Great Again' hat
Ok, we gave him a chance. Now what?
I think the next election should be decided by the popular vote
How great is this? Let me tell you. It's so, so great. Believe me.
Care to join me in starting-up the human population again?
Yes. I put a fork in the toaster.
What were we fighting about?
January 21st isn't as bad as I thought it would be
I don't suppose we can get takeout.
The first 100 days
Time to enjoy our empty nest!
Well, I never promised you a rose garden.
Face it, Doris--our son needs help.
You told me to use the plunger.
It's funny how focused our conversations can be when you wipe away all the distractions.
Well, at least we have our health.
Next time you tap your ruby slippers please don't say, "There's no place like Homs."
I think the election turned out fine.
Okay, okay, okay. Maybe, just maybe, Hillary would have been better.
Really not sure where Amazon will be leaving our deliveries.
Don't look at me like that, I voted for Hillary!
What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
Maybe now you have a moment to talk about our Lord and Savior...
Did you really mean it when you said you wouldn't sleep with me even if I was the only man left on Earth?
I don't think this is the "fresh start" the marriage counsellor envisioned for us.
I told you to read the directions.
I want a divorce.
CheapMideastVacations.com? Good job, honey!
I knew this was coming, but I thought he'd at least get sworn into office first!
Yeah, but Hillary's emails.
But the important thing is we haven't compromised our principles.
What was it you were saying about "last man on earth?"
Okay, yes, you had a point. But were we supposed to just ignore those emails?
Now, what did you want to talk about before we were so rudely interrupted?
I *know* you're the last woman on Earth. It's a figure of speech!
My day was fine, how was yours?
I told you we should have taken the nuclear holocaust rider.
Don't make this into a bigger thing.
I told you a vacation in Syria is a bad idea.
You still want that divorce?
Yeah, but at least he got rid of Obamacare!
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say Eve.
And that'why I think Bernie would have won
Well, I DO consider this a date.
Maybe we should eat out tonight?
At least I heard the wall on the southern border is still intact.
If it didn't spark joy, I got rid of it.
I thought Vladimir and The Donald were friends!
Well, at least this solves our illegal immigration problem.
I'd like to have a nuclear family some day.
Great again?
Still better than Hillary.
Why can't you ever look at the bright side?
I promise, once our luggage arrives you'll feel much better.
Do you think the bus will be on time today?
Well, I'm the last man on earth. How about that date?
Any plans next Tuesday?
And to think he did all of this in his first month.
This is probably an exception to needing a formal introduction first.
Yeah, but think how bad it would've been if she'd won.
I called Geico but the phone was dead.
You said I needed a hobby
I pick the next vacation destination.
Yes, but she did have her own email server
Well at least the election is over.
Did I mention that I'm thinking of becoming a vegan?
I'll miss Mexico too. But it was cheaper than building the wall.
How do you feel about procreation?
Now what? I leveled the playing field......
Well this time Mexico can pay for it.
I told you it was off season!
Yes, he did say "you want to be unpredictable" with nuclear weapons, but you're totally twisting what he meant.
I’ve always wanted to learn Russian.
We'll always have your icy glare.
No, I asked you to turn off the stove.
Hi Eve. I'm Adam.
Honey, I think I forgot to turn the gas off.
Can we at least agree he was right about Putin's strength?
Are you still mad at me?
I suppose this means the bus will be late again.
My, those were good beans!
Now will you marry me?
Who'd of thought a Tweet could do all this?
What do we do now, Eve?
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
I forgot my safe word.
It appears that gerrymandering has side effects.
Well, we knew Trump was going to change things
Told you Bernie was the answer.
We won. Still not happy?
All right we're done with the community property.
Makin' America great again requires starting from zero.
The good news is the furniture arrives tomorrow.
I slept with her once, four years ago. Why are we still talking about this?
I think we should go with House Number Two.
Look on the bright side. Hell didn't freeze over.
Shall we eat out tonight?
I told you that vote for Jill Stein was a waste...
I'm just saying it's a pretty big coincidence that this happened right when you asked me to do the dishes.
I assume this answers your question.
Turns out, we paid for it.
Why, I had a great day! After 21 years on the job, I finally got to push the button.
Please, no more garage-sale pressure cookers!
It doesn't feel like a Sunday.
Wanna fool around?
I guess we should have asked how he was going to be the greatest job creator God has ever seen.
I realize it was a good deal, you booked well in advance, and it's Aleppo's high season but you had to buy non-refundable tickets?
Upside: You said you wanted to downsize.
My name's Adam and you are?
Yes, I was a boy scout. Why?
But I'm the only man left!
I think your Flambe' went FlamBoom.
I thought it was just a video game.
Well, we bought this house for the land.
It seems that instead of trying so hard to read what was in the candidate's heart, we could have just listened to the words coming out of his mouth.
So Alice, tell me again why building a bomb shelter was the most ridiculous idea you ever heard.
I told you, we should have voted for Hillary!
And then I said "If you're really the Hulk, prove it!"
I said Air BnB, not Air TnT!!
Not my idea of "great again."
It's the 'we still have each other', that worries me.
We are NOT going to your Mother's.
OK, so you were right. And I know Twitter is gone, but I'll bet he finds a way to tell us how bigly he personally destroyed the other guys.
I'm fairly sure today is your day to clean.
Okay, so that wasn't my photo in the profile. I still need you to repopulate the earth with me.
There goes our theatre subscription.
I still wouldn't vote for anyone with a private e-mail server.
I already told you: I wouldn't kiss you if you were the last man on earth.
Eve, you once told me 'Adam, I wouldn't marry you if you were the last man on Earth.' Care to reconsider?
It would have been worse if Hillary was elected.
Would you vote differently next time?
You asked me to nuke dinner.
I always thought it was the First 100 days that were significant, not just Day 1.
I won't admit anything. I still think Hillary would have been worse.
Now, as I was saying.
I thought you would cancel my Trump vote!
So, how do you think the date is going so far?
I voted for Trump...You?
I told you not to antagonize him on Twitter.
I take back what I said I wouldn't do even if we were the last two people on this earth.
It seems you and I have hit a rough patch.
When you said, if you were the last man on earth...
Well, at least he tweeted us first
I got rid of the spider. Satisfied?
Not that I'd ever say, "I told you so".
Who knew Twitter could be so dangerous?
Ok, ok, I voted for him. I never thought he'd WIN.
Oh? You take this as a sign that Putin isn't our friend?
I am sure this is just part of the plan to make America great again
Well you started it.
I told you time travel can be unpredictable.
As your financial advisor, I strongly suggest you continue with the maximum contribution to your retirement account...
Do you remember when we were first married and we had nothing...
I DID vote for Hillary, honest....
Don't worry. We get to vote again in four years!
That was a bit rash, don't you think?
We might be the last couple to have met on Cinder.
Wel, we were planning to down size sooner or later.
Now that I'm the last man alive will you reconsider your policy on not dating coworkers?
You can't seriously be blaming me for THIS one.
The instructions? Yes. But no, not in their entirety, per se.
Ooops
America's great again.
I'm Sorry, Honey. You were right.
Now that I AM the last man in the world will you reconsider?
Okay, I guess I'm no Walter White.
Really, we have an OBLIGATION to perpetuate the human race?
So are you also just blowin' through town?
Apparently, no one thought to explain to the president the meaning of 'carpet bombing.'
Yes, that's correct, I am now the last man on earth.
Why did Streep have to open her big mouth?
It's not my idea of great, either.
Frankly my dear I don't give a damn
So do you still stand by your Jill Stein vote?
You told me I should cook for once
Well you can’t get more ‘fixer-upper’ than this.
So much for checks and balances.
There is no going back to the way things were between us, George. You've ruined everything.
"You still think paying off the mortgage early was a good idea"?
Lesson learned. A blender is not a good gift.
Well... I'm now the last man on Earth.
Maybe we shouldn't have grounded him for the whole weekend.
Should we get started on repopulating the planet?
And to think this all started when Bill Clinton got a blow job by Monica Lewinsky.
After this, anything would be great again.
Well ... we've still got each other...
Left the stove on again, didn't you?
So that's what the hazard light was all about.
But no. You just had to push the button.
Your cat had something to do with this, didn't he?
What else do you need to know about me before we reboot humanity?
Oh, and another thing, I don't care for your tactics, Catherine.
It's good to be on the winning side!
No, Carl. This has nothing to do with my period.
Sorry...I thought he'd just continue the tweeting.
So much for choosing a vacation spot by a spin of the globe.
But on the plus side, think of all the new jobs rebuilding infrastructure.
Well, you did tell the travel agent you hated crowds.
Is that a"no"?
Is this what he meant by "Making America great again?"
I can't remember if I closed the garage door.
We should have voted for Hillary.
So, about that 'last man on Earth' thing ...
Yeah, but still, the swamp was drained.
Funny how life inmates our marriage.
Oh, yeah? But Benghazi! Missing emails!
I think this would be a good time to discuss our future together
I didn't promise you he would be here! I said we could go and wait, but Godot, you know, could be busy...
seriously....what did you have to lose?
We can still be friends. You make it sound like it's the end of the world!
NOW will you agree that the Electoral College should be abolished?
Oh, and you weren't curious about the reset button.
But her e-mails...
But still, her email server.
No, I do not know where you left the remote.
When they said this place was going to experience a population explosion, I had no idea.
And SHE deleted those emails!
Where should we eat?
Kiss and make up?
On the bright side, our yard looks better than the Joneses.
So, do you still think he's going to make it great again?
At least he used a secure e-mail server to do it.
Still think he's going to "Make America Great Again"?
We'll have to take the trick-of-treaters more seriously next year.
Did you really mean it when you said 'not if you were the last man on earth'?
Well, I think I've been exposed to your explosive side...
It was only a little charcoal starter.
But it looked so easy when Emeril did it, honey.
Can we just keep this between us?
How, exactly, was this my fault?
Crazy first hundred days.
You didn't have to blow up like that!
I told you D.C. would be a bad place to visit this month.
Let's just hope somebody wins soon.
Yes, I would still vote for him!
My facts still say he was a good president.
Believe me, the deal he made with Putin was absolutely terrific!
At least, he built a wall!
...but if only one Russian is left -- we won.
Thoughts?
But it's good for the shareholders.
Come here often?
Now aren’t you glad I paid for the lower deductible?
No, we're not great again yet, but it's a start
Yes Meryl, yes, you may have underestimated his temper tantrums.
Your move.
Look on the bright side. At least the lesser of two evils didn't win.
I'm in the mood for love.
At least our molecular structure remains intact.
It's like when I'm with you nothing else can bother me.
Given the current political landscape, 2016 seems like such a distant memory.
You were right. We should have tried marriage counselling.
You started it.
Go ahead, blame it on Trump.
What, we're still together??
On the bright side, I no longer feel bloated and gassy.
So much for the elephant in the room.
For the last time, yes I'm sure I locked the front-door before we left.
And they also took away my Obamacare.
I never thought I would meet someone who also liked earthquakes.
Next vacation let's check with TripAdvisor before booking.
Ok! Alright! I'll never invite the guys over again!
At least he didn't have a private email server.
I still think he was a better choice than Hillary.
Well, he did get rid of all the Muslims.
I told you I'm no chef.
OK, maybe laissez-faire capitalism isn't effective 100% of the time, but MOST of the time it works just fine.
I clearly said, "the one on the left is the reset button and the one on the right is the launch button"
Not even if you were the last man on earth...
"Like a box of chocolates", you say?
For the sake of argument, let's just imagine I AM the last man on Earth.
Well... not quite the first 100 days I was expecting. Coffee?
We'll find out what's happened. Hand me the remote.
I'd only heard of the 'Scorned Woman' effect.
SO HOW WAS YOUR DAY TODAY
see i told you he'd drain the swamp
Well, 2016 was interesting
Well, I feel great again.
Let's not tell anyone we met on Cinder.
We should never have unfriended them.
Well, I certainly haven't forgotten about her emails.
I definitely preferred the Age of Aquarius.
I warned you the lawyers would take it all.
Well, if he's going to make America great again, it's better to start from scratch.
Touchy battery in my smart phone.
Maybe he meant South America.
So, you're still standing by your vote?
Well, love is a battlefield.
Do you still want to see LA LA LAND?
Now will you sign the papers?
Please don't say 'I told you so,' but you were right about that mattress tag.
Bad day at work sweetie?
Yes, Dear, I heard you say you smelled gas, but the Giants were about to score.
to think it all started with the Tweet heard 'round the world...
It's important that we retaliate swiftly.
And all I'm saying is, I very likely am the last man on earth . . .
President Trump has certainly hit the ground running.
'The travel agent did say this would be a hell of a place to visit.'
Okay, you can keep the house in the settlement
You said there would be other couples
Sorry but they said they had come in peace.
So .... what's new?
Like I always said, we'd survive.
I missed the real estate boom
And people thought 2016 was the end of the world.
You mean "turn off the gas" wasn't a metaphor?
I used to meet people on line.
Still want me to give him a chance?
I typed "shalom" but autocorrect made it "shell 'em."
The reviews were on point regarding an authentic, "post war" experience.
Well, that his 1st 100 days.....
I think I killed the spider...
I find this all a bit disconcerting, don't you?
Next time we host a party, don't invite your sister and her kids!
You are the one who wouldn't add Alien Attack insurance coverage.
At least he drained the swamp...
I told you he would save the middle class.
Well, at least abortion is illegal again.
Well don't try that recipe again.
He shouldn't have called her over-rated.
Yes honey, it's safe to say I didn't call Dig Safely.
We'd better get started on re-populating the planet.
He said he was delegating the Daily Security Briefings....
I said "until hell freezes over." Not "the last man on Earth." You never listen.
O K you win.
Say, can I have some of your purple berries?
My name's Samuel. Samuel Beckett. Who'd you say you're waiting for?
I still say I smell something burning
So what was I supposed to do? The button said: 'DO NOT PUSH.'
It's too soon to comment. Let's wait and see what happens next.
How could you forget our Passports?
The world ended and all you want to crab about is how I don't have a job.
You left my life in ruins. I want to see other people.
So much for make america great again.
Well that wall idea sure bombed.
Proud to be the gentrification vanguard!
United States - Jan. 20, 2017
Turns out the end IS nigh.
I see you know how to cover your tracks.
Well, I guess the meek will inherit the earth after all.
Okay, next time we can try your idea.
Did you remember to turn the stove off?
I thought you turned it off!
At least I remembered to take out the garbage.
Hey, I didn't vote for him!
Next time, I’ll be voting for ‘change’ again.
We should probably be going now. ..
I think our fights are getting a little out of hand.
Yeah, but the other one couldn't keep track of her emails.
NOW are you happy?
What were we fighting about again?
When he said "make America great again," this is not what I pictured.
So, what are you thinking for dinner tonight?
I still say we should give him a chance.
I said, Show me Siri.
Do you live here or are you just visiting?
Our relationship is in ruins.
It looked much nicer on Yelp.
Right again, dear. Happy now?
We need a new toaster.
'You don't look like your Tindr profile at all.'
"Next time, Marla my dear, please vote".
Don't look at me, you voted for him.
Have you seen my "Make America great again" hat?
Now, he will make America great again.
Your chocolate cake was dynamite!
Do you remember if I turned off the gas before I left the house?
I'll believe in global warming when I see some actual proof.
We never should have let him drain the swamp.
I told you not to vote for Trump.
I don't think "mansplaining" is our biggest issue right now, Deborah.
And this is after he drained the swamp.
It appears we are getting a do over, so this time stay away from the forbidden fruit
We'll always have Canada.
That turkey was overstuffed and you know it.
What I said was, "Let's try to spend a few days in a balmy environment."
On the whole the Make America Great Again Campaign hasn't gone badly.
You were the one who wanted to try Airbnb.
I wanted a little alone time with you.
It's great again.
All-in-all, I think the divorce came out just about even. Have you seen the kids?
Ok, ok. You win! You can be President!
Yeah I voted for Trump. Why?
Sorry about dinner. Should we just order in?
You said you wanted to go to somewhere exotic.
This is exactly why I told you not to comment on Internet articles.
I knew we should have taken an earlier flight.
Don't look at me ; I didn't vote for him.
Stop complaining. Ruins are ruins.
I don't know .... I just didn't think she was that likable.
I know, I can't think of anything funny to say either!
Well, so much for the old 'exploding cigar' gag.
No, I said I _wouldn't_ marry you if you were the last woman on earth.
We're now between a rock and a hard place.
So, would you care to rethink that "not if we're the last two people on Earth" comment?
I told you we didn't need and extended warranty for the washer.
I know, it's my fault
Would now be a good time to say "I told you so"?
The brochure said we'd be visiting recently discovered ruins.
I know. I know I told you it would all be fine.
I just wanted our first date to be really memorable. Too much?
Shall we stay in or go out?
I agree. Junior gets no more chemistry sets.
I meant it when I said I wouldn't marry you even if you were the last woman on Earth.
Mind if I smoke?
The principle called, that boy is nothing but trouble.
Well, rent is a lot less than midtown.
What can I say? How do I know when 'Do not push this button' means do not push this button?
You voted for him, I didn't.
I feel a draft. Do you feel a draft?
I say he's the president and we have to give him a chance.
Well if you knew what Aleppo was, you should have said so before we bought the tickets.
The bus is never this late.
Repeat after me; I will never host a family gathering near a national election again.
TripAdvisor did describe this tour as 'devastating.'
Okay, OKAY! No more nasty tweets about Trump.
This wasn't my idea of a nuclear family.
Trumpageddon.
I said I wanted a mind-blowing experience, not a mine blowing experience....
He's GREAT builder. The best.
It's all Obama's fault.
Nothing is ever good enough for you.
Okay--maybe I did leave the gas on.
Don't think this gets you off the hook for Valentine's Day, Kevin.
Thank you for joining up for our anger management group. Usually there's a long waiting list, but lucky for you, that changed recently.
...AND I'm missing the new season of Sherlock.
I told you to look on Tripadvisor.
My travel agent said this place is the bomb.
Well, if I knew that Judgement Day was coming today I would have worn a tie.
I'm just getting out of a relationship.
There are things I miss about the old swamp.
Wrong again! I'm the President and you're the First Lady!
I told you to make sure the toaster was unplugged!
Let's just forget about the past
Don't blame me, you're the one that voted for him
On the bright side, it appears splitting the house will be less complicated than I had anticipated.
Yes, I'm the last man on earth. Would you please just deal with it?
Now that we've agreed on the distrubution of our assets, let's contact our respective attorneys and call it a wrap.
Fine, we'll go see your parents.
Don't give me that look: I didn't even vote!
I'm glad we settled this argument calmly and quietly.
You can't blame me for everything.
Wanna have sex?
I guess our lawyers took scorched earth literally.
Hell yes, it could be worse. Hillary could've won.
I don't think people use pressure cookers, anymore.
Ok fine, but you have to admit he built a damn good wall.
We have to start meeting like this..
Of course not. No one is left to marry us.
You can keep the kids...
The Joneses' rubble heap is bigger than ours.
Well, that was a fun first date. What do you want to do tonight?
North Jersey. You?
Was that if or unless I was the last man on earth?
Do you still think Trump will get 4 more years?
So, you wanna get back together?
"Sorry, Honey".
Your mother had something to do with this, didn't she?
I'll agree to counseling if you agree to control your wrath.
"I told you so," is getting old, Florence.
I see your point.
Believe me, the deal he made with Putin was just terrific!
I suppose my chap stick was in your purse.
Don't look at me. It was your demographic that put him over 270.
I still stand by my vote.
I sense another blow-up coming.
Hey, I found the plans on the internet. I didn't think it would really work.
You're surprised?
See? I told you it was too much cayenne.
You said "If you was the last man on Earth"...
Was it really necessary to get rid of everything to make it great again?
Shall we go out for some pizza?
I swear, there was a Starbucks right here the last time I was in Mosul
Okay. They should have repealed AND replaced.
The ad did say this property needs some fixing up.
Let's not argue.
Now that I'm the last man on earth, can I have a kiss?
I knew we shouldn't have voted for Trump.
Don't give me that look! All I did was vote for the guy...
But he said he'd make America great again...
I told you Airbnb was a bad idea for Aleppo.
Come on Martha, Detroit is not that bad.
It's repealed. But will it be replaced?
Maybe restarting the nuclear arms race wasn't the best idea.
Interesting that we meet on match.com, though.
I may have crossed the red and green wires.
Still feel bloated?
You said I would regret it.
Did you remember to cancel our Netflix account?
There's no need to shout.
You're hired.
Well maybe hell hath no fury like you but this is extreme
Well Hellen I am the last man on earth.
Couldn't you just try to give him a chance?
Would you still vote for him?
No, I didn't read the reviews on Trip Advisor...
Hey, I didn't vote for him!
Your turn, Hil
Don't worry next one will be fantastic.
Don't tell me. You just had another hot flash.
What do you mean, you win?
President Donald J Trump. What could go wrong?
I think I'm ready to take that vacation you keep asking about.
So much for protest votes.
You wouldn't date me if I was the last man on earth so you may want to reconsider
Now are you ready to move?
It seems your withering commentary has finally gone too far.
Yes, I cut the wrong wire, but you need to sandwich that between two compliments.
I feel like Italian tonight. How about you?
Well, I never thought you would actually USE the nuclear option.
Well apparently you ARE the last person on earth
Now I am the last man on Earth. I am not going to ask the question again, but I do hope you will reconsider.
Yes, dear, we still have each other. Your point?
The wifi is out. I guess we'll have to...umm... talk.
Care to reconsider that last bit about how you "wouldn't marry me if I was the last man on earth"?
Yeah ok, but what about Benghazi?
It was listed as hot real estate.
We bought this house for the land, anyway.
...as I was saying before we were interrupted...
Like I said a year ago, 'Not even if we were the last man and woman on Earth.'
He huffed & he puffed.
Did you turn off the stove?
Don't give me that look. I voted for Bernie.
I guess it's time to make America great...again.
On the bright side, we won't need to keep up with the Jones'.
I asked you, most politely, not to dabble in witchcraft.
I bet my day was worse.
Worst. Match.com. Date. Ever.
Hi. I'm Adam
Just wait, in his second term he'll get things turned around.
Oh, so now I'm supposed to STOP talking about how I feel?
Guess we bombed on our first date?
actually, I said "how about a little 'nookie' ?
Still, a good war.
Yeah, but you said "Be a man, install the propane fireplace yourself"
Have it your way...it was an apocalypse, not a cataclysm
Donageddon.
Okay, you've made your point.
You look different than your profile picture
Just a guess but I'd say either ISIS or Kellyanne Conway.
Two weeks in and the Trump presidency isn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be.
At least I didn't play my violin.
I think I left the stove on.
So, where do you live?
I was hoping death would do us part.
Did we leave the oven on?
So, after you put the pork chops on the grill, you went back inside for how long?
Do you come here often?
Do you really think this is a good time to burn our bridges?
I tried to tell you, but noooo..., you wouldn't listen. You just went ahead and 'clicked' on it anyway.
Take what the president-elect says symbolically, not literally.
I was pleasantly surprised to meet a kindred spirit on Match: someone who also found post-apocalyptic settings to be romantic.
Do you believe in love at first sight?
Well, that was a heck of an election.
Does HGTV have post nuclear fixer-upper?
this... this is the worst that could've happened.
There goes our health care.
So, what else is new?
I know a determined developer when I see one.
Not to fear. This is just what Detroit needed.
See, I told you... I'm a woman scorned.
I believed him when he said he was going to end terrorism; I just thought there would be a few more left on earth.
This reminds me of a story...
Yes, but he DID build that wall.
Fine, the photos do do it justice.
Now are you sorry you voted for him?
The review said 'elegant austerity.' You try finding a better place to stay in Aleppo.
Then Trump got on his twitter account to respond to the accusation.
So, have you started dinner yet?
North Korea looked so nice in the propaganda.
Here's to Donald Trump 2017!
I know, I know but come on! Did you see her emails?
I think there's a bit more to it than me falling asleep with my pipe lit.
I see I've finally gotten your attention.
Wouldn't a mouse trap have been easier?
It was a huge success.
Insurance. How about you?
ok fine, your right, there's probably a better way to start the pilot light on the stove
What about now that I _am_ the last man on Earth?
You should have said something when you saw something.
We'll rebuild. Guatemala will pay.
See... didn't I tell you that life would still go on.
If not apocalypse NOW, when then, Janet, when?
A little fixer-upper to begin with.
So, where are you from?
How is it that these vacations only seem to qualify as disasters when I select the destination?
Well, he said he knew more than the CIA and the generals.
so... I guess this is what they meant by "great again"
At least it will be a memorable first date.
No. I STILL won't go out with you, even if you ARE the last man on earth!
Yes, as a matter of fact, I would still have voted for Trump.
I told you he would press the button.
We'll always have Glasnost.
You shouldn't have made those incendiary remarks
It's a chance for us to get to know each other again...
I still say I'm not going to your mother's.
Okay, maybe I shouldn't have voted for him.
Did you pay the President Liability Policy Premium?
So big business is running the goverment. It's not the end of the world.
Well, Mr. Goosestep, you got exactly what you wanted- a male president who knows how to shake things up.
I always knew getting that vasectomy was a bad idea.
I keep telling you -- I DIDN'T vote for him!
I guess you have to say YES now!
No, still not interested.
Something must have delayed Godot.
You said you wanted unobstructed views
Will you date me now?
The app says all busses are running on schedule
I misinterpreted the AIRBnB review.
Wow, that was close. Now where do we go for lunch?
Our first date was a blast.
All righty, then. Let's revisit Plan B.
Don't look at me like that. I voted for Obama.
I'd ask you out - but we already are.
Yeah, well Trump said they started it.
This is the worst shore excursion ever.
At this point I'd say that the lack of room service is a moot point.
So what was your position in the Trump administration?
That's the last time I buy a toaster oven on clearance.
I told you not to touch the remote.
Face it, Helen. We're just no good for each other.
Hon, sorry. We're between a rock and a hard place.
But at least he tells it like it is.
I wouldn't go out with you again if you were the last man on earth.
Why are you looking at me like that, you voted for him.
Thanks for meeting with me...
Now, where were we?
I have a nagging feeling I left the stove on.
Well, it was, "huuuge."
I'm tired of winning.
So much for a president who tells it like it is.
Well, who did YOU vote for?
But have you seen his ratings?
Honey I unclogged the sink.
At least we showed those cockroaches, didn't we?
Why aren't you making dinner?
On the bright side, these are preferable to that hideous sectional.
It's nice to see the EPA and HUD starting to work together.
Oh yeah, this is still Hillary's fault for not getting elected
Sadly, it's no longer a metaphor.
I think we threw away our vote.
So what if I WAS the last man on earth?
I never promised you a rose garden.
Martha, our relationship is in ruins.
So since we're the LAST two people on Earth now . . .
You're right, I should have voted for Hillary.
Your anger management therapy doesn’t seem to be working very well.
Too much chili?
Well, Jan, it's no longer hypothetical. I am the last man on earth and, for humanity's sake, you've got some pride to swallow.
This isn't as great as I remember.
So, what do you wanna do for lunch?
We sure are lucky.
You never take me anywhere.
To be fair, the brochure did not describe the ruins to be explored were ancient.
Man, 2017 is going to be my year.
Okay fine, I voted the wrong way. Are you happy now?
So much for your, 'They wouldn't dare drop the big one!'
At least we finally have that ocean view from our window.
Now, where was I?
Now, hopefully, our little spat is over.
You shouldn't have told him that his hands were small.
I told you it was not microwave safe!
Now you're fuming?
See I told you the country would survive Trump!
Did you make the insurance payment this month?
Are you going to go nuclear on me?
Now that I am the last man on earth, I hope you will reconsider your decision to not date me.
Is this what he meant by "making it great again?"
At least the wall is still standing
You said "If you was the last man on Earth"...
Where would you like to go for dinner?
Remind me again what 'emails' were.
I'm sorry. I only meant it as a protest vote.
The infrastructure upgrade bill might pass now.
We must have forgotten to turn the oven off.
I told you not to deep fry the turkey.
It looks like the last tweet did not make America great again.
Well this is a fine mess you've gotten us into this time.
Small hands don't matter. All you need is a small finger to push the button.
Ok Margaret, you win.
And you're the last man left? There must be a re-set button
Oh yeah, it’s always my fault, isn’t it, Martha?
I will never again question your intuition.
Didn't I tell you NOT to touch the thermostat?
I trust the make-up sex will be even more epic.
I still think we're better off with Trump.
Yes, I AM the last hope for the human species.
I told you Trump wouldn't completely destroy the country.
Well, I guess your mother was right.
I'm really going to miss my filing cabinet.
Fifteen minutes could save you 15% or more on your next insurance policy.
So where'd you put the remote?
So this is what rock bottom feels like.
I still say he deserves a second term.
I guess he really didn't care if North Korea got nuclear weapons.
Obviously I'm going to read the Airbnb reviews before booking next time.
Okay, now that you've made your point....
Fake bomb, fake bomb, so sad.
Marry me and all of this could have been yours!
This isn't a New Yorker cartoon, you know.
Let's never fight again.
First repeal, then replace.
So this is what they mean by a Tinder date?
At last, the last person on earth!
As you can see there's a lot here left to gentrify.
This is cool. What else is on your bucket list?
I hope I haven't destroyed our relationship in the process .
What were you saying about global warming?
So, what are you fixing for supper?
Okay. You were right.
But our last building was prewar.
'Nothing much. What's new with you?'
Well, we still have each other.
Yes honey, I'm positive this is the Hard Rock Cafe.
"I'm voting for Trump", she said. "He speaks his mind", she said.
I miss TV.
So much for our reverse mortgage.
Do you suppose we should have taken the tuna fish out of the can before microwaving it?
Fair enough, but on the other hand, she did have her email on a private server.
You're right, I shouldn't have voted to drain the swamp.
Your dad was right, it took about 30 years to see the results of his presidency.
So I'm pretty sure I left the stove on.
I still think you can never use too much lighter fluid.
This is the greatest America ever.
Honey, I was convinced I fixed it
Anyway, how was YOUR 2016?
I take back what I said about the "last woman on earth".
Well, you voted for him!
Ok, so the inauguration was more than I expected....
Really, I'm surprised it took this long
How was I to know five-year-olds could be so hard to control?
Thanks Obama!
This is why you can't go home again.
So what made you swipe right?
You just couldn't ask for directions.
And to think that an angry tweet led to all this.
I wasn't kidding when I said if You were the last guy on earth.
Don't say no to a fresh start.
For the last time, no, I didn't vote for him either!
There was this video, 'Re-light your gas heater's pilot." That's all I remember.
Let's give it a chance with an open mind...
Look on the bright side. It'll only take four or eight years to rebuild.
Sure, there have been a few bumps in the road, but you don't see any immigrants around, do you?
Ok, fine. You were right. A Trump presidency was one of the signs of the Apocalypse.
Armageddon hungry, how about you?
You said you turned of the gas.
How ironic, we both voted for Trump,
Your Mother seemed stressed.
should've swiped left
I guess we'll have to go out to eat.
I told you I smelled something burning
OK, OK maybe my Middle East bargain vacation idea was a mistake.
Any idea how this is playing on social media?
I'll call and see if we can get an earlier flight back home.
It's not the end of the world.
Maybe I should have let you roast the turkey inside in the oven.
We really had a blast last night.
Now, where were we?
It would have been worse with Hillary.
Couldn't you have just thrown a plate or two?
I suppose now we’ll have to move.
You just had to push the button, didn't you?
I told you those beans gave me indigestion.
Half? No way! My lawyer says I'm entitled to at least two-thirds of this rubble.
You don't respect facts and you never did.
Still say you didn't leave the oven on?
At least it's near the 4 train.
So I was wrong. I thought he would make America great again.
Now, can we check this off your Bucket List?
I had no idea that's how you felt.
Four years???? It only took him four days!
You've always wanted a fresh start!
I don't know. Where do YOU want to scavenge for food?
I think I left the iron on.
Thank you for your convincing demonstration of hot flashes
You know what they say: with great power comes #Tremendous destruction.
But all the polled meteorologists said it would miss us.
Now look what you've done....
I thought you said he was only repealing Obamacare
Peaceful, isn't it?
Well, did you have a better plan for urban renewal?
Well, there goes the first 100 days...
Do we have to talk about this now, dear?
There's no way he'll get re-elected
I may have overreacted.
Now what?
So, what 'were' your hobbies?
He got it wrong. It's with a bang, not a whimper.
We had a good run.
This is what you get when you mix Special-K and cough drops.
I think we're both going to be late.
I say we sit here and waite for his next tweet
You thought I was kidding when I said I would rather be in a real war zone than dinner with your mother!
I'm thinking of moving to the suburbs.
Read the instructions first?!
There should be an Electoral College they said. It will more fairly represent the entire country they said.
I'd like to add you to my network on LinkedIn
Now we know what happens when you divide by zero.
Boy that orange guy with the combover is touchy!
This is what happens when you vote for a President in Real Estate.
I tried to tell you you were blowing this out of proportion....
It took an apocalypse to finally downsize!
Okay, then. Turn it into lemonade.
I have a solemn duty to impregnate the most fertile of the remaining women.
At least we've still got each other.
Honey, I think we should start seeing other people.
Honey, I told you that getting a dog was a bad idea...
I think we should give him a chance.
This is a bit different from what Ayn Rand predicted.
I'm a demolition manager, you?
I think we are out of milk.
How many times have I asked you to look before you back out of the driveway?
Trust me honey, we can rebuild from here. Our foundation is strong.
I strongly disagree. We had the terrible waiter on the second trip to Paris.
I should try the insurance adjuster again. Her voice mailbox was full last time.
Now we can finally let go of that post-election anxiety
Was it something I said?
Lawrence, I've been thinking - I'd like a divorce.
So, if I was the last man in the world.................
So now what now that I am the last man on earth?
Well, at least I didn't vote for him!
I've told you before, 'Always give the Uber driver 5 stars.'
And I still say we got a great deal on the flight.
No wonder we got such a good deal on AirBnB.
Wasn't me.
OK, honey, we'll try it your way now.
God bless you.
Finally meeting you was a blast.
I’ve been lighting farts since I was twelve and consider today’s effort to be my greatest achievement.
I just told him, "Delete your twitter account."
Besides that, how was the play, Mrs. Lincoln?
But really, when is a good time for a blind date?
Fortunately, our mutual contempt remains intact.
And then I swiped left and boom.
Let's eat dinner out tonight.
You gotta admit it just doesn't get any greater than this!
"On the upside, no more vacuuming!
How did this place get a 5 star review for vacation
Do you think we should tweet about this?
"This is your fault".
I told you to just call an electrician.
I can't believe, Carrie, that you're still angry about a silly high school prom.
Yes, the New Yorker subscription is terminated.
Well, at least now we know what happens when you put Metallica in the microwave...
It looked like a nice place in the brochure.
I suppose you'll be wanting to go out for dinner …
Ok--Maybe the Trump years didn't quite live up to Obama Presidency after all.
Look on the bright side. You always wanted to redecorate.
Is your mother still coming for dinner?
I'll take the car... you can have the house.
You couldn't just agree to a simple divorce, could you...
It was the meeting to end all meetings.
Emily, I want a divorce.
where do you think you parked the car?
I told you you shouldn't ask me to help cook dinner.
You're the one who voted for him, I didn't.
Have you seen "La La Land" yet?
And THAT is why you don't feed aardvarks nitroglycerin.
What's your next idea Honey?
You're right, counseling might not be that bad an idea.
You say that about all my friends
Again now. The smoke alarm is not a cooking timer.
We need to talk
I am the last man on earth.
I told you not to vote for him.
no worry dear; they said they'd replace after the repeal,
I TOLD you our son was running with a bad crowd.
I still want the vacation house.
OK then, Next time we'll do it your way!
Wanna have sex?
"I'm confused - I thought he said he'd make America great again".
You don't looked pleased!
So this is Make America Great Again?
My bucket list? Paris and the Maldives.
Looks like a telework day.
I'll have a contractor look at it tomorrow.
Ow that we've downsized, what's next on the agenda?
You were saying?
Well, that's that. So what's for lunch?
Stay Out of the Kitchen!
You in the mood for some sushi?
I told you so.
I said I'm sorry.
First time in twenty years there's no honey do list.
Well ... one good thing is, your mother's visit is finally over.
I always wanted a fresh start!
I told you, we should have voted for Hillary!
I don't think they are going to have the Early Bird Special.
How about something Cajun?
Um...maybe launching a preemptive strike against Russia for leaking emails went a little too far..."
I think it was some guy in his house from New Jersey.
I always regretted promising to love you 'til the end of time but I'm glad it finally came.
Tell me again why you voted for Trump?
Do you have any plans this weekend?
"However unlikely." Your words, not mine.
I told you to vote.
Did you read his latest tweet?
Match.com will never know how exciting our first date was.
I guess it's not as funny as I thought it would be...
… And I understand that the zoning ordinances are very flexible in this neighborhood ….
Don't blame me I wanted Clinton
I swear there's nothing else...
I guess your mother finally has to move out.
You waiting for the nuclear bus as well?
I guess they didn't care for the deal.
Next time I pick the restaurant.
You could've pick up a little.
I guess we should cancel the cleaning service for this week.
The service here at Smithereens is just terrible.
Fine, you win...I'll ask for directions next time.
Did I say "the LAST woman on earth?"
Well, at least we've got each other.
we shouldn't have told the realtor we would consider a fixer upper
So, what brings you to apocalyptic fantasy camp?
C'mon, I said I was sorry.
I say we make a run for the Canadian border.
If only you’d have let me warn Meryl Streep to keep quiet.
So...Who did you vote for?
He won.
I've always heard that they're good for your heart...
Where do we send the rent?
When I said "we wouldn't date until the end of the world," I didn't mean it literally.
Okay, yes. Technically I did say if you were the last man on earth.
Well, on the bright side, now we really can "make America great again"!
Cabbage has never agreed with me.
Should I ask for a different table?
Good thing our flight was late
I never thought he might actually win!
Voting for him seemed a good idea at the time.
Can we just call it fake news?
Will you marry me.
No more candles.
I still think she would have been worse.
Yes, but I thought we'd still have football and mixed martial arts.
We'll start with a trendy coffee shop
Did you remember to bring any snacks?
Fine, next time you pick the restaurant.
I wonder what the kids are up to.
Honey, did you mail the insurance premium check I left on the mantel?
But you must concede that der Fuehrer very nearly made Deutschland Great Again!
it's still better than Hillary.
At least we have each other.
The Day After the Inaguration
Dystopian. D-Y-S-T-O-P-I-A-N.
OK, maybe I left the gas on.
Well, he certainly has taken Nixon's madman theory to the next level.
How was I supposed to know that would happen?
Well, did YOU read the fine print?
Now that that's settled, what's for dinner?
Okay- so I did vote for him.
I told you not to let me eat beans.
Should we go out for dinner?
Well, aren't you the most beautiful woman in the whole city.
So...you were right about giving Johnny that chemistry set.
Would you say it's safe to call ours a post-election relationship?
You just don't recognize greatness. Sad.
...and how many times have I told you to turn off the iron before you leave the house?
I'll bet you're a glass half empty person.
I guess going with War-Torn Tours wasn't such a good idea.
Ceasefires just aren't what they used to be.
Do you want to see a counselor before this blows up again?
They say it's just urban renewal starting.
I knew giving Billy that drone would be a problem
It's in a great school zone.
OK, so what's for dinner?
I don't know, the end of the world isn't all it's cracked up to be.
I would still have voted the same way!
You told me to expand my horizons
I suppose you want me to admit you told me so.
The new Samsung battery needs a tweak.
We should give him a chance.
Well, I guess we don't have anything else to divide; see ya around!
I would report this but it seems too much like a fake news story.
The 'replace' part may take a little time.
Okay, but on the bright side, we can now find out if we DO have what it takes.
Honest, mother. I didn't do anything.
North Korea's aim is getting better.
It's the closest we can get to Williamsburg in our price range.
Yes, I know I said 'not even if you were the last man on earth,' but I didn't mean it literally.
Well... now I am the last man on earth
Well, we've still got each other, I guess.
With that being said, Danielle, will you accept this rose?
So I drive too slow. It's not like there won't be another Rapture.
Well, we still have each other.
Cyber-attacks aren't that bad after all.
Do you think we have a future?
Who thought one little tweet could destroy the world?
Yes, now we can talk.
DIVORCE was the nuclear option!
So were you sent back here to repopulate as well?
So, how do you feel about voting for Trump now?!
For better or worse
Forgive my timing, but before our flesh starts to melt....
Let's order out
Tell me you did not forget to pay the casualty insurance.
Come on, give him another chance! Let's see how he does in his next 100 days.
Sorry I'm late. Couldn't get a cab.
Next time we should buy travel insurance.
You may call it a dystopian landscape. I call it the future .
I don't think the bus is coming.
Never again will we spend the holidays with your parents.
I would call this "great again"
I told you we'd be early.
Do you still say that nuclear holocaust is preferable to Donald Trump?
Okay, now comes the pivot.
Checking back now that I AM the last man on earth.
We're the only survivors left on earth.... I still want a divorce.
Should we order a pizza?
I still say he's bringing our jobs back.
At least the spare key didn't get damaged.
What is Aleppo?
I thought you had the picnic basket.
Backing up all the family photos to the Cloud wasn't such a terrific idea
I guess your argument for the lesser of two evils theory wasn't specious...
I just want to make it clear, as one of the last two people on earth, I still support Trump.
If it's any consolation, we won.
What's for dinner?
That's right. It looks like you have to cook tonight.
Was it something I said?
You're the one who wanted to move here.
I thought YOU were going to turn of the stove!
Yes, I would vote for Trump again.
Make America great again again
Ok, maybe it isn't so "Great".
Still think things are better under Trump?
So THAT'S the worst that can happen. Interesting.
... and to think we were on the waiting list for a reservation at this restaurant for over a month!
I really miss the PBS News Hour.
Still think Trump was the way to vote?
Looks like we're empty worldsters.
So... what was all that "last man on earth" talk?
Are we still doing casual Friday's?"
All right, but this isn't over.
So much for Russia's Order of Friendship.
Fiber, schmiber, no more beans for dinner.
This is the new normal for all non deplorable people!
According to this Tweet, it was Hollywood's fault.
When he asked, "What do you have to lose?" I didn't think he meant everything.
Ok, but I'm keeping the furniture.
And to think it all started with a tweet....
I apparently misunderstood your definition of 'nuclear option'.......
What's for supper?
It drives me crazy that you don't empty the dishwasher.
Curse the electoral college system!!
Not if you were the last person on earth!
Then the machines took offence to the president-elect's tweets.
It ain't over till it's over...
I guess your lawyer really did mean scorched earth.
OK, now I see my vote was a mistake.
Can you tell me please, who won?
I'm glad we decided to part as friends.
Yes, 'nuclear option' _is_ an overused metaphor.
It's may not be Eden but it's ours
I still say there was nothing wrong with his foreign policy.
They were serious about getting rid of all of Obamacare.
I knew a scorched earth divorce wasn't a solution
How about we just stay out tonight?
Eve?
Hey, don't look at me. I didn't vote for him!
You just had to send him that nasty tweet!
It looks like we've solved all of the world's problems in one fell swoop.
Monday's; am I right?
I'm not so sure these virtual vacations are all they're cracked up to be
I told you to check the stove before we left!
I don't suppose you kept the receipt for that pressure cooker, did you?
You're the one who voted for him.
So, you left the stove on?
I guess it's up to us, Eve.
You think Dr. Katz will still charge us for the full hour?
Well, I'm just glad to have voted for a change candidate that finally delivered.
So far, it ain't that great!
This will all turn around once he builds that wall.
This is why no one comes to Syria for vacation!
Now I don't even want to be in your will.
Would you prefer to be the last person on Earth, or shall I?
Well, at least I can pick my doctor
Trump accidentally pushed the red button while Putin's prick was up his ass!
Thank you for meeting me halfway
Are you finished?
What time was your flight?
I bet Bob's wife let him build a bunker.
I remember the old neighborhood differently.
Shall we NOT go to the coffee shop, or NOT go to the bar?
'Well, that was unconventional."
But he has almost completed the wall.
This might sound like a stupid question but did you bring my haemorrhoid cream?
Do you agree I was right about the results of the election?
Look! America is great again.
They said it was a "fixer.:
You know, I do think your parents being here for the holidays really did put a strain on things...
Life is like a box of chocolates......
I think we should continue to look for a place with more atmosphere.
That was a close one
And tomorrow night?
Did we leave the oven on?
He kept his promise. He drained the swamp...and more.
Really. I swear I turned off the gas.
So, what were you saying before we were so rudely interrupted?
Thanks for agreeing to meet me on your day off.
I have this great plan, so great, it will blow you away.
I've been thinking about trying the Paleo diet.
Well, that just happened.
I'm thinking we don't wait till we have the frequent flyer miles.
'Sorry Adam, I have an apocalyptic headache.'
Really June, the whole damn world is gone and you want a divorce? Really!
Love is a battlefield.
I'm not sure this time share in Syria was such a good investment...
It's your fault for not voting.
...and it's only been three days from the Inauguration!
My 401k has taken a real hit this year.
Yeah, but crooked Hillary had a private e-mail server!
Wait, you still want to move?
Thank God we've got total catastrophic insurance.
May I suggest that you don't bring that up again.
I wonder what the winning lottery numbers are?
It seems silly to say this now, but I really screwed up.
Don't look at me, I voted for Bernie.
I wouldn't sleep with you if you were the last man on earth.
We're safe now.
Take that.
OK, I'm the last man on earth. Now what?
So, where shall we go for dinner?
Still happy you voted for Trump?
So, are you for or against nuclear disarmament?
Well why have nukes if we can't use them?
I'm starting to have my doubts about him getting Mexico to pay for the wall
Isn't this romantic?
Let me tell you a story about a man who said he would "Make America Great Again."
My name is Adam; may I call you Eve?
We'll always have Paris...
So, what did you think of the election?
Could be worse... Could be raining!
I'll need at least three previous landlord references.
So, is your family coming back again next year?
What did you expect?
Well...when you're right, you're right...I probably should have voted for Hillary!
Are you SURE you turned off the gas?
It's not big on ambience, but the food is amazing.
Are you feeling the Bern now.
'Last woman on Earth' is just a phrase, Janet.
Don't blame me. I voted for Hillary.
What we lack in passion we make up for in staying power.
No, spilling red wine on the carpet is an "accident."
Well, I never said things would be perfect once he took office.
Celibacy is so yesterday.
I told you the mayor shouldn't have been so critical of the new president.
So, about that "last man on earth" comment!
Next time, let's do it without the electoral college.
I was told my tweet really got under the president-elect's skin.
Fine. You can have the house and I get the furniture.
I see it as an opportunity to make America great again.
I told you it was a bad idea to vote for Trump
Will your mother still be coming to visit?
Next time, I'll hold the match, thank you very much!
Yes, I do think this is great.
Did you say it could or it couldn't have been worse?
Do you know how to build a wall?
When does the "great again" part start?
It seemed romantic at the time to take us back to where we had our first date.
I'm up for procreation if you are.
I'm surprised WE are the ones who survived the apocalypse and not cockroaches and twinkies.
"So, to sum up, that's why I think we have to repopulate the human race".
So it would appear you did forget to turn the coffee maker off.
I think we should skip,till death us do part.
This is not what we had in mind when we pledged our support for the nuclear family.
This year, death and destruction for me. Next year, pestilence for you.
I don't think this is constructive.
I miss my phone.
We should start right away. It’s our patriotic duty to repopulate the world.
I heard the neighborhood is up-and-coming.
This redistricting business is truly getting out of hand!
I told you I couldn't cook
I'm still fond of you Agnes, but I never really liked civilization.
Okay, Abby graduated without a college loan. Now what?
Surely you can’t blame this on him! The President’s been out of the country building a new golf course.
I guess the Electoral College really does need to be revisited.
Now that that's out of the way, can we talk?
It's a shame this didn't happen on a Monday.
What did you expect? You voted for Trump
Of course I knew he was a narcissist with control issues...
You should have read the small print
Did the bombing keep you awake?
The last thing I remember saying was 'Don't press that button!'
Yes, Marge, the election is finally over.
I guess it wasn't such a good idea voting for him after all.
Well...so much for arbitration.
See, I told you-just sit tight and it will all blow over.
What's your sign?
Because there was a special deal on the "Syrian Getaway".
Our side won?
Maybe your were right.
"Where would you like to go for lunch" ?
You just had to leave the fork in the microwave, didn't you?
Perhaps and area rug would bring it all together.
I don't care if you won the popular vote!
The counselor warned you about what could happen if you bottled up your emotions.
So, have you been on Tinder for a while?
OK, your turn.
Sure, but she used a private email server.
Did I leave the stove on?
What did we ever do to North Korea?
I think we need a mediator.
Is safe to say that your place or mine is out of the question?
So, here we are again.
Martha, I get your point about your 'scorched earth' approach if we divorce!
I'd still vote for Trump
I'm thinking more along the lines of "Thank god he only had 140 characters to work with".
I'm thinking that this is not going to end well
I warned you; "call me crazy, I"ll show you crazy."
OK, now that we've settled that let's talk about who gets the house in the Hamptons.
Well, he said his inauguration would be "like nothing before in this country."
It doesn't matter if you're the last man on Earth! It's no!
Now remind me again about your moral principles as they apply to private email server accounts?
Ok, so it IS the end of the world.
So maybe *now* they will impeach him?
Ok, yes. I left the f-ing iron on. So, sue me.
So what's for lunch today?
Don't worry honey. Congress says they're going to replace everything very soon.
You know, this is where our bedroom used to be.
I TOLD YOU NOT TO LET YOUR MOTHER COOK.
Oh dear, I'm afraid those beans were stronger than usual today.
Who has the greener lawn now, Helen?
Shall we dance?
I guess the Russians DID hack our game consoles.
Much of it wasn't worth saving anyway.
I never imagined that I'd be one of the lucky ones.
It wasn't important.
So the rapture has come and gone. How about a latte?
I'm not fluent in smoke signals but I think it's bad news.
Was the - "Afternoon in ISIS Controlled Territory" - mentioned in the brochure?
Well you don't look a thing like your picture either!
Bigly!
I'm thinking of running for president.
I still say he made it great.
Four years was enough. No way I'm voting for a second term.
I would have preferred keeping the filibuster.
Yes I DID text the UBER driver our address.
Okay, IF your mother were still alive, I still wouldn't want to go to her place for Thanksgiving.
Now that I am the last man on earth what do you have to say for yourself.
With all earthly possessions out of the way, we can now discuss what's really important to us.
Did you really have to invoke the nuclear option on our marriage?
Yeah, but at least we won the war on Christmas.
Well, you told me you wanted to de-clutter.
Well, at least there's no room for your mother this year.
So, what you're saying is that an amicable split is probably not going to work.
I didn't say it would work.
OK, I admit I was wrong about Trump! Can we just move on!
Good thing we've got a piece of the rock.
So, you're saying I have anger management problems?
Well, considering there are no more fish in the sea, I'd say we make a good match.
Oh yeah? well ... sometimes... yer'farts don't smell like roses either, ya'know...
Anymore bright ideas?
My gas is back.
Let's party like it's 1949.
Well, that wasn't so bad was it.
So...what do you like to do for fun?
I TOLD you 2016 wasn't so bad....
The idea is repeal and replace...pretty much universal plan now.
Do you think they will still give us a free breakfast?
So, I said to myself, "I'll take a chance and vote for the anti-establishment guy"
Don't be ridiculous, this was not on my bucket list!
Company policy states we need someone to blame.
Why make them, if we weren't going to us them?
Do you have any plans for supper, Honey?
Is it too late to take back my yoga pants?
You think it's rent controlled?
It could be worse. Crooked Hilary could have won.
It doesnt look like much now, but with a bit of work and sweat equity, you could build the home of your dreams. Don't take too long to decide. I have some people coming by this afternoon.
Oh, you want to go scorched earth? Let's talk about you and your mother's many similarities.
I can't find my wallet.
Okay, next time you plan the vacation.
I'd rather stay in tonight.
They just couldn't leave the "little fingers" bit, alone, could they?
OK, I was wrong—we should have went back and checked the stove.
Frankly. I think Armageddon is over rated.
Don't worry dear, Trump is a builder too
Do you think I should run for a second term, Hillary?
What the hell did you do that for, Hillary?
I know, I know, you told me this would happen.
I'm starting to have second thoughts about love and war.
He did say that Putin respected him.
Not bad for my first term in office.
But it has great reviews on Yelp.
I knew I should have voted for Hillary
This does not excuse you from date night.
I don't think he meant it.
I don't think that mindfulness will help.
Usually mediation is the recommended way to go...
Does this mean my parents can't come for the holidays?
Isn't this great again?
The one I'm going to miss the most is the Trump Tower.
We should have let Trump buy us out.
It's unprecedented.
Not even if you were the last man on earth...
So, about that last man in the world thing..."
Whatever you salvage, I get half.
I looks like you and I have something in common with roaches.
It's colder than I expected.
How should we nurture Generation Gamma Ray?
Before you ask, yes - I am the last man on earth.
I do love the smell of the air after a storm.
No chance I'm getting my security deposit back, huh?
I hope you brought the Twinkies with you.
I've told you before! I wouldn't marry you if you were the last man on earth!
You're raze or mine?
I'm really sorry I voted for Trump.
Do you really think I would have called him 'Trumpelstiltskin, the gold-spinning imp' if I had known that he could already order a drone strike?
(singing) If you were the only girl in the world, and I was the only boy...
I didn't realize that Trump was a weapon of mass destruction!
But gee, didn't we dance a lot at the inaugural ball ?
Guess I really was a ticking time bomb.
In my defense, I did say you wouldn't like me when I'm angry.
Wanna fool around?
True it's not DEATH...but I say we still part!
Do you want the good news or the bad news first?
Reason number 873 I voted for her.
Some 'disaster', until he tweets it I guess this is Fake News.
Look, and he's only been in office a few days.
I knew I should have ordered the fish.
Honey, I think we need marriage counseling.
Shall we move to one of the Red States?
now do you believe me?
So can we agree to divorce now?
This is Trump's idea of "draining the swamp.
Next time I'll remember to turn off the gas.
At least we don't live next to any refugees.
Fine. Fine. Fine. You can have the house. Are you happy now?
Online dating seems a little pointless now.
I think it's almost over. Or maybe it's just begun? Too existential? Should I quote "Waiting for Godot?" It's my fault, isn't it? I'll just be quiet.
That's the third time this week.
The more things change, the more they stay the same.
Yes dear, this is what's left of DC after the Trump invasion.
Made you blink." "No you didn't.
Relax. They missed us, didn't they.
I'm glad we finally got to visit Aleppo.
Want to get brunch?
Do you always feel the need to grill me on the hot seat?

At least we know the nuclear arsenal is still operational...
For pity's sake Marjorie, never mention that phoenix again.
TripAdvisor said "open vistas."
This time we're not going to miss out on the next hot neighborhood
I wonder why the airline is late?
This is bound to effect property prices.
This doesn't surprise me, you know what happens when you eat too many beans.
Now it's great again.
Circumstances require us to be Adam and Eve!
I still say it's Obama's fault. He left President Trump no choice but to firmly deal with sanctuary cities.
We finally have smaller government and low taxes. You should be happy.
Call for a pizza
I have a feeling I left the oven on.
Shall we tackle spousal support next?
You're over-reacting dear.
I told you to go outside to smoke that cigarette.

I told you no one would notice if you wore the same outfit again this year.
So, let's talk more about your background!
Yes dear, I did say "let's move here, it's a safe neighborhood."
I think we are looking at another bubble.
Less is more.
It isn't so bad after all ... it's only one day after Trump's inauguration and we still have a place to sit!
The election's over. Now what?
How's your Mandarin?
I thought it was kind of a big sparkler.
there's one good thing about this: my therapist told me to simplify my life.

So, what kind of house are you looking for?
I TOLD you we'd be fine with Trump as president.
I felt like we needed a fresh start
Regrets? I've had a few. But then again, too few to mention.
O.K., O.K., you can have the remote control.
..and we are only a short cab ride away from some of the older, more traditional ruins.
Well, we can wait as long as you want ... but he never comes.
I thought that was the agreement - I pick the vacation and you book the hotel.

I know my place needs some sprucing up.
Maybe we shouldn't have used that extra strength bug bomb.
Yes. I still want to talk about emails.
It's not you, it's me and my post-apocalyptic, pre-inauguration phase.
At least we won't have to pay taxes anymore.
Let's just try living together for awhile to see if we're compatible.

Maybe we shouldn't have voted for Trump.
So I guess we shouldn't have said that on Twitter, huh...
I really shouldn't have eaten all those beans.
It's our policy not to use the term climate change.
This is not what you mean by starting over?
Who cares if the world has ended? You still owe me money.
Hillary did it.
That look on your face is devastating.
Wow! Suddenly you remind me of Burgess Meredith with his glasses off.
Someday son, this will all be yours.
Don't give me any "I told you so's."
DID YOU HEAR? TRUMP WON!
Fine, you were right, but we live in a blue state so my vote didn't count anyway.
I told you it was a bad idea to try to charge your phone in the microwave.
What are we having for dinner?
At least Match.com survived.

Looks like its the two of us, Marge.
I think you'll agree that since the Inaugural, speed dating has run its course.
What?
Next time I'll plan the vacation get away.
I thought the agent was joking when he suggested the Godzilla rider.
But we have a wall now
Guess Trump shouldn't have sent out that last Tweet...
The labeled clearly said not to mix the bleach with the ammonia.
Are you sure you checked the references on the guy remodeling the kitchen?
Maybe disbanding the HOA wasn't such a great idea.

Well I think *you're* a bit of a fixer-upper!
That is the last time we're inviting your brother over.
I thought the remote in the side drawer would open the drapes.

You don't expect me to fall for that "To Save Civilization" line, do you?
So *now* when's your mother coming to stay?

Yes, but imagine if it had been her, with those emails!
By far the cheesiest apocalypse I've attended.
As I did the cooking I think it's only fair that you load what's left of the dishwasher.

I said deposition, not demolition.
I told you he'd make it great again.
You've got to remember to turn off the toaster oven next time, Helen.
It was your private server.

This wouldn't have happened if you could have handled killing the spider yourself.
What has Trump done this time?
Burgess Meredith found the library. We could, too.
Okay, I will admit I'm sorry I voted for him.
I guess you can't make dinner tonight!
Tom and Fifi sure know how to throw one hell of a going away party.
I thought you said you liked the outdoors?
I hear Amazon is hiring.
Utilities aren't included.
Not what I was thinking when I said we'll have a blast.
I think you left the porch light on.
It's a Pre- and Post- War building. With large outdoor bathrooms, as many bedrooms as you'd like, and an excellent view of the Apocalypse.
You voted for him, didn't you?
I guess white privilege gives us an advantage after all.
I thought you had changed the batteries in the smoke alarm.
Finally, No Distractions!
To me the price was right for visiting Syria.
OK, where do you want to start first?
Getting me flowers won't cut it this time.

So this is why you don't vote for Donald Trump.
Have you noticed that the New Yorker cartoonists seem obsessed with rowboats, recently?
... and his re-election slogan is 'Make America Great Again. Again.
Do we have to go out tonight?
Try not to see it as the end of the world, but rather the start of the next chapter...
Yes, all your expired Bed, Bath & Beyond coupons are really expired now.
This is great again, right?
I keep telling myself 'It's a new world.'
He made America hate again.
All I'm saying is you have no idea what was in those emails.
Well ... we could always stay with your mother.
Tell me again how you managed to get a discount on this piece of property.
I told you not to deep fry the turkey.
Let’s go to Hawaii for our next vacation.
Look at the bright side....
What can I say? I believed him.
Ham on rye. You?
This reenactment group is a little too realistic for my taste.
Did too!
My lunch? Two burritos.
I told you not to have lunch at Taco Bell.
Would you be willing to relocate?
Well?! Are you finally willing to go to Mother's?
I blame the Russians.
I know what you said about "even if I was the last person on earth" but given the circumstances.....
High tide isn't for a while.
He won.
The bus isn't running today.
So. You said "VOTE Trump."
Irony?
You didn't say anything about "nuclear codes". All you said was that he does not treat women well and that his hair is ridiculous.
You were right. I shouldn't have voted for him.
We really need to talk.
So this is Trump's America?
Ready for some post-apocalyptic urban renewal my dear.
Well, at least we've got each other.
Seriously, where would we put your mother?
We made America great again!
That'll teach you to Twitter back.
You're hired.
You were right, I shouldn't have voted for Trump.
I told you we'd be fine, even with his finger on the button.
So there!
I didn't know Enola would take the gay comment so personally.
This is the second time something like this has happened, Mrs. O'Leary. I don't think they'll buy the cow thing again.
Excuse me.
OK, I will admit it, voting for Trump was a mistake. Are you happy now?
So, where do you want to go for dinner?
See, this is Trump's Russian real estate deal he doesn't want leaked.
Now THAT'S what l call urban renewal.
NOW, you decide to stop wearing your Trump baseball cap!
Too much?
I voted third party, you?
At least we got to keep our kids on our insurance.
If I take a selfie, who should I send it to?
I don't care what it looks like, I still believe he made American great again.
Maybe this "See Aleppo" vacation package was not such a great deal.
This is the last time I let you airbnb the house to a WWII reenactment group.
I'm telling you, the food here is worth it.
I told you we had chemistry.
Still support the nuclear option?
I TOLD YOU HE HAD NO FOREIGN POLICY EXPERIENCE!!!
"But the emails" you said.
I doubt that we'll find a better ground-floor opportunity in Detroit than this, Mildred.
I'm hungry. What's for dinner???
I asked you not to let your mother come for a visit.
"Should we plan on skipping lunch or first check Snopes?
Did I do that?
Tell me again how "open space is trendy."
Aren't you happy you voted for Trump now ?
This ain't fake news.
Emails emails emails.
Now if the giant ants could only be domesticated.
Well, at least we have our health.
You're so pretty by the twinkle of burning tires.
"Open space remodel," she said.
Be the change you wish to see in the world.
I told you so.
It's so lifelike.
Does it smells like something is burning to you?
This is the last time we sign up with Devastation Tours.
We've already been through hell and high water...
The answer is still "no"
Fast forward three weeks into Trump's presidency...
That is not in the terms of our prenuclear agreement.
On the bright side you always wanted this room to be light and airy.
So much for the great vacation package in Camden.
You're not a liberal are you?
If you think the last four years were great wait until you see what he plans for 2020.
Next time we'd better take a closer look at the brochure.
You called in a drone strike because they played Metallica after eleven?
Well, you and your nuclear family campaign have finally gotten your way.
You can keep the house; I'll take the cash.
And what did YOU say?
I told you we should have gone door to door in Iowa!
How was I supposed to know this really happens if you tweet his name three times?
Wish he had told us more how he was going to make it great again.
That's the last time we spend the holidays at your parent's.
My dear, we have the opportunity to refresh our promise of ¨In good times and in bad, in sickness and in health ¨!
We're the last two people on earth. Having second thoughts?
Alien invasions always looked more exciting on TV.
Just because you can doesn't mean you should.
Ok, round two, moral high ground.
Doesn't feel pyrrhic to me at all, I won.
No I still don't regret not voting.
How was I supposed to know what that button would do?
Are you still happy you voted for him now?
You don’t look like your online dating profile, but that’s no longer a deal breaker for me.
No, YOU blinked!
Darling, there's something I've been meaning to tell you.
So...do you have any hobbies?
Next time Julia, more Cherries, less Bomba
I heard Trump Tower survived.
I'm pretty sure this would have been a lot worse if Hillary had won.
So this is what America First looks like
I told you it was a bad neighborhood.
Is that all there is?
It's an up and coming neighborhood.
Sad!
So, have you given an;y thought to dinner?
Cutting cable didn't seem enough.
So what's new in your life?
You shouldn’t have sent that tweet.
How many times I have to tell you to be careful what you ask of Alexa.
Whoa! Look at the devastation! Yep, Trump just became POTUS.
Just turn around and take a peek Mrs. Lot.
Gentrify this?!
Does this mean I can't go bowling tonight?
You're right. Maybe this wasn't the year for a protest vote
Is it 'Really Great' yet?
Russia had nothing to do with Trump's election. Just you wait and see. Once the truth comes out, you'll really feel embarrassed.
I'm actually looking forward to the 2020 Presidential primaries.
You've really done it now, Ralph!
Do you think we can both learn to date outside our religions?
Remember when I said "If you were the only girl left in the world" ...?
Don't blame me, I voted for Jill Stein.
I still think he was a good President.
I know you told me you smelled a gas leak, but I still think I could have fixed it myself.
Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get. Except with Donald Trump.
On the bright side, no more housekeeping.
At least he kept his promise to get rid of the immigrants in our neighborhood
I TOLD you we should have voted for her.
I told you we should move into your mother's basement.
Maybe our order should have been for 'mild' chicken wings.
Now Trump's really done it
I regret my vote.
I told you to turn in that stupid cell phone!
I think Russia did it.
That'll show them!
You were the only person to answer my apocalypse dating ad.
No, I've not seen the remote.
I trust he shook things up enough for you?
Well, it could be worse.
Wanna dress up like zombies and go scare people?
At least we have somewhere to sit.
At least we won't have to choose the curtains now
I told you it wouldn't hit us
Did you remember to lock the door and turn the gas stove off?
Something tells me that your husband found out about us.
Who says climate change is a hoax?
Well, we don't have to worry about the termites anymore.
I guess we'll have to rethink our plans for Saturday night.
It's been a long four years.
No, I DID NOT vote for him.
How do you suppose one gets to Mars?
I don't want to fight with you anymore.
You would be the last man on earth.
Well, I don't think Kanye would have been a worse president.
Gee, it's good we missed the 5:42.
Dishonest media.
Eco-tourism under this administration certainly is different.....
So...Who did you vote for?
Don't ruin this for me.
No, it's the end of the world as you know it!
This argument sure has blown up.
No, the good news is not we can now redecorate again.
That Godot guy was really disappointing.
Since we are the only survivors, I guess this is our first date.
Don't look at me, I didn't vote for Trump.
It was the dog.
So you're sticking with your story that you turned off the stove this morning?
Are you *still* glad you voted for Trump?
It's your turn to let the cat out.
Microwave safe?
Wait two weeks and propose the golf and hotel complex.
Maybe Trump will build a golf course.
In my defense, the brochure said that Aleppo is beautiful this time of year.
I never promised you a rose garden.
I agree. This is not as great as we had hoped.
And you were worried about emails
I 'm going to quit smoking.
Are you sure you won't marry me?
No, it's your fault.
Fine, you're not in the minority. You're still wrong.
What are your plans now, Madam Secretary?
Good thing we pressured Trump not to make friends with Russia..."
Now that I finally have you to myself... there is something I've always wanted to tell you...
You keep coming up on my Tinder.
All right then! No more chili for me.
Whoops. I did it again.
I suggested a scorched earth approach as a joke.
I thought the app was tinder, not not twister.
Making America great again is harder that I realized.
I hope we're not in Kansas any more.
So. When did you first know you wanted to be an arsonist?
Yeah, but at least he's kind of funny on Twitter.
Oh, right. 'We ought to check out what's really going on in the Middle East!'
Not all my relationships look like this....
Did you remember to lay out my pajamas, feed the cat, and unplug the flux capacitor?
Now the neighbors are gone, we can cook what we like on the BBQ.
I still say fracking is perfectly safe if it's done right!
Okay, so I should have voted for Hillary.
Dinner got a little burnt. Shall we order in instead?
I think it's best if you never try to cook again!
We've got to give unpredictability a chance.
But then I wouldn't have met you, Rosie.
I suppose you're just going to try to ride out our marriage, too.
Hey beautiful, your bomb shelter or mine ?
And how does this make you feel?
I told you this would happen if you voted for Trump.
We should have held off on the redecorating.
Don't blame me. I didn't vote for him.
It's November 9th.
I hear the lines at Disney World are pretty short.
I'm still focusing on the good.
This might have been easier if we had a prenup.
What's for dinner?
Frankly, my tweet, I don't give a Trump.
I'm not the one who wouldn't sign the petition.
I think I prefer your 3-alarm chili
I'm sorry, it's over. We just have nothing to talk about anymore.
Does it really matter that I left dirty dishes in the sink?
So, shall we just agree to disagree?
Fine. The casserole wasn't that bad.
I said we'd put an end to human rights abuses in this region and I stand by that.
I'm telling you its not my fault.
Next year, you pick the vacation.
So, you left the stove on?
There went 25 years.
Back in the day, Fifth Avenue, Midtown, was a fancy neighborhood.
How is the considered great, again?
Have you heard back from the insurance company?
I'm sorry I don't date liberals.
And you insisted we vote for him!
Bombs don't kill people! Bad guys with bombs do!
We can pretend we are from the stone age.
Well, I guess he should have supported the Nuclear Agreement
We need an address for delivery.
You didn't think that was better than iMax?
Well at least he was born here.
I told you not to park on the street.
Do you think the insurance will cover it?
It's the scorched earth defense.
So, who did you say you voted for?
Now that I have your undivided attention...
Don't worry, dear, this is all small stuff.
This blind date ended with a bang.
You and your mystery tours!
And I thought my life was in ruins before.
Pull my finger.
Have you considered real estate?
Still not ready to move north?
Wasn't he supposed to to CLOSE his Twitter account?
...well, then how about Outback?
"Will you bury me"?
Alright, we'll call it a draw.
Okay. I'll take the garbage out. No need to go nuclear.
But Benghazi!
'What's the worst that can happen if he wins the election?' No need to speculate now.
XYZ Pest Control was very thorough.
Maybe you should run for president.
And then he said there'd be more jobs... And then he said everything would be great again...
No more inaugurations for me.
I thought we agreed to meet on neutral ground.
It beats renovating
He cut me off! What was I supposed to do?
I don't know how we got here either
Just my luck. Now all my discount coupons are wasted.
Glad your mother only visits once a year.
Maybe building the fireworks factory downtown wasn't such a good idea.
Want to sing "Side by Side"?
Remember the good old days before Trump, when the New Yorker Caption Contest used to be much better?
" I know it hurts to hear this, but there has to be somebody else besides you I can marry.
I can't decide. What do you want for dinner?
I never thought you and I would be the last two people left on earth!
Have you tried an antacid?
Did I not ask you to make sure the stove was turned off before you left?
Someday this will all be yours.
And who did you vote for?
Do you think our smartphones work?
Well, the bus isn't due for another five minutes
This time you've ruined everything!
See what you've done.
Well, at least you're out of 'I told you so's...'
Happy? Last man on Earth.
don't worry: we're in new jersey - the clean-up will only last a few more years.
finally, we have our privacy.
I'll tell you what it means, it means no more alternate side parking.
I'm sorry, but your home owners policy doesn't cover nuclear holocaust.
Think of it as a second honeymoon.
Shall we go for a stroll?
He promised a large infrastructure program.
O.k., if i'd known this would happen, I wouldn't have voted for him.
See, I told you after the kids flew the coop we'd still be a nuclear family.
I still won't marry you
We've got nothing in common.
You said declutter. Now I also have to do it your way?
Well it's not like we haven't been here before.
What about the emails?
The divorce lawyers won.
Woman: You, with your stupid scented candles!
Well, with Hillary it would have been even worse.
The inauguration was rather rough.
When my mother visits, you don't need to go nuclear
We have to find a pleasant place in the neighborhood.
Detroit is lovely this time of year.
I personally blame those third party voters.
Well, so much for an off season "all Inclusive"
My old therapist was never this accommodating.
I'm afraid our relationship is smoldering.
Really? An apple?
I told that voting for Trump would end badly!
This is not a metaphor.
I told you to not touch the thermostat, Brenda.
I'm not sure Donald Trump is even qualified to sit in an exit row on a plane.
And you were worried about getting the best seats.
What did our representative say that so upset Trump?
What a way to start off a first date?
I told you to turn off the stove
It all started with your reverse mortgage.
Well, you were right. He really did “shake things up”.
Why do I always have to pick where we eat?
After I told her I was leaving her for you, she blew up!
Nothing but blue skies from now on.
Make America great again, they said.
Adam is my name, hope you don't mind if I call you Eve.
Do you think McDonald's is still open?
Look on the bright side. Armageddon is finally over with.
We've been Trumped!
So what's next on the agenda?
I voted for him because he seemed like the lesser of two evils.
Well, he said he'd shake things up.
And being from different political parties, we won't be repopulating the earth.
It's done wonders for my economic anxiety.
Some full moon/Friday the Thirteenth combination, huh!
When I said that we should spend time enjoying the great outdoors, this is not what I had in mind.
Technically the brochure was right; the astounding views do rivet your attention.
You didn't have to blow up like that!
Well, at least we have a place to sit.
But, you weren't scorned!
So, is this how all of the deals in "The Art of the Deal" ended?
I told you our families wouldn't get along.
You scare me when you can't have your way.
On the upside, the Mulligans won't be round for charades anymore
Looks like you were right about Humpty Trumpty.
Well, at least we won't have heavy moving expenses.
You knew I had nuclear capability when you married me.
And you said voting for Trump was no big deal
Wonder why our Aleppo tour guide is a no-show?
Maybe we should just go out for dinner.
Now might not be a good time to tell you that I left the stove on.
Your life is in ruins
This is the last time I give in to one of your "bargain" vacations!
Awwwk-ward!
Will Uber be able to find us?
And there are 1361 days more of this?
Standards don't matter during the apocalypse.
Let's not fight over the remote tonight, OK?
Yes, but he's going to build that wall.
I told you not to make fun of Trump's hair.
The facts may be that the world is destroyed, but I'm entitled to my opinion that we're about to make America great again.
So, how has your day been?
Yelp says they have the best Baklava in Aleppo.
Your ruined hovel or mine?
This is terrible. How will we ever keep up with the Kardashians?
Lesser evil sure isn't what it used to be.
Phew...I thought the kids would NEVER go back to school!
Maybe this global warming theory has legs.
So, maybe we should start with coffee?
And how does this make you feel?
Honey, you really are the last person on earth I'd want to be with.
I missed the episode right before the bombs went off. What happened?
It will be a small wedding.
First dates are a blast.
So now, will you go out with me?
Eve. have you still got that apple, we could try it again.
Know any place that is open for lunch?
There's a silver lining: At least you've got your health!
I guess I should have voted.
I had the courage to change the things I can.
And why would you say that I'm mansplaining this?
I keep telling you, I didn't do it.
Excuse me.
And you said, "he would never use nuclear weapons ...blah, blah,blah...
People are saying we made a huge mistake. Tremendous mistake. Idiots!
Now that we finally have some privacy...
All I said was that he had some good points on immigration.
That reminds me, did you turn off the kettle?
No, I don't think you have to remind me I voted for the wrong candidate!
Sylvia, those beef burritos were the bomb!
Now look what you did with your vote and we don't have health insurance anymore
It's not all bad. The White House says rebuilding society will be a tremendous investment opportunity.
Don & Vlad are no longer an item.
I know,I know,but the tickets were nonrefundable.
Next time, wear your glasses before setting the timer on the microwave.
Don't say you told me this would happen if the Donald became President
I wish you hadn't voted for Trump.
So how is your day going?
I still say Hillary would've been worse.
You voted for who again ?
You wanted open and airy; you got it.
Want a foot massage?
Well at least we don't have to worry about our high deductibles anymore.
You knew that Kansas was always on my bucket list. We can go to Hawaii next year.
After the last election post truth just evolved to post apocalypse
Wow! I'd say your 5-Alarm Chili was way too hot! You should change the name to Chili Con Carnage!
Well, I guess I should have voted for your candidate.
So, I suppose this is related to that 'sixth extinction' thing you're always talking about.
Be thankful--at least we have our rocks.
Till death do us part.
I guess we'll be eating out now.
Gladys, did I not specifically warn you what would happen if you went with the 'nuclear' option?
Who ever expects their neighborhood to blow up like this?
Great
See, I told you.
No, you said nuclear was just an option.
Did you really think we were in Rome?
And this is what is experienced when the virtual reality user selects the 'Nuclear Option.'
Well, he still has 99 days to come up with replace.
But your profile said you were into post-apocalyptic cosplay.
"You wouldn't dare." you said.
Now do you believe me when I said touching that red button was a bad idea?
Was this the housing boom you predicted?
I thought you'd be excited about the free 3-night stay.
How 'bout now?
You lost your keys?
Look, I told you I have an explosive personality.
Thanks Obama!
Well okay, the agent did happen to mention it was a 'pretty distressed' property.
January 20, 2018
NOW you tell me your mother canceled her visit.
Well... I've never been one for small talk
So, what's for lunch?
I thought the Trumpocalypse was just a metaphor.
I told you not mix the Clorox with ammonia
Okay, Linda, you win. I'll take the kids.
Well, Gladys, things sure get a lot more exciting around here when the grand kids visit.
You don't have to agree with me.
That scorched-earth attitude of yours does not engender calm communication.
It won't happen! Sad!
I guess you could say I'm a survivor too.
You were saying you'd like half?
You just had to bring up the election during dinner, didn't you?
But this IS what Hell freezing over looks like.
Yes, I read about the advancing hurricane...but I assumed it was fake news.
I've always been an advocate of open space.
I've still got my debit card.
Do you think it'should too late to kiss and make up?
So much for your "Dynamite Muffins."
So, where should we begin?
And then I thought, "I know, I'll cast a protest vote!"
You had to tweet at Kim Jong-in, "I double dog dare you!"
... and I thought we were becoming friends with Russia.
I'm standing firm in my "Not if you were the last women on Earth" position.
And so it goes? That's all you've got?
Who says online dating isn't a blast?
Is this virtual reality, a bad dream, or the election jresults?
Let’s take it slow. There are some things I am not sure about.
I'm just guessing but I don't think the bus makes a stop here anymore.
At least we're lucky to have dressed for work.
So what if he didn't make America great again? His tweets were great.
Your candidate didn't exactly set the world on fire.
Er ... yeah. Thanks. Happy new year to you, too.
Looks like it's just you and me against what's left of the world!
I disagree, Trump succeeded in making America great again.
Our house, in ruins? Don't believe what you read in the news – they're all fake
Coffee?
My mother said this just a taste of what she will do if I actually MARRY you.
Well, next time don't say "I don't care" when I ask you where you want to go on vacation!
Well, we won't have to pay for online dating service anymore.
I told you not to press that button.
Same time next year?
I can't believe it's been only two months after inauguration.
Ok...NOW it's your turn.
This isn't good . . . I lost my cell.
You think surge pricing has come down by now?
I told you we left the oven on.
They warned us this would happen after January 20!
Well at least my vote helped to shake things up.
So, how are the kids?
I told you those bridge lessons were a waste of time and money.
We need a new travel agent.
What do you say we rebuild a future together?
You said it was fake news!
I told you the buses weren't running.
Well apparently some people play the fiddle and some people brood.
But SHE used a private email server!
You know, somehow I'm just not feeling that great again.
Well I hope now that you are REALLY happy that you voted for him.
Is this where you take all of your VR dates?
Hiroshima, mon amour.
He IS MakingAmericaGreatAgain. Starting with a new foundation!
Now what?
Ok, have it your way.
I told you voting for Trump was a bad idea.
This place gives your skin a radiant glow.
Well at least the stone seats we just bought didn't burn...
I had a terrific, amazing first day on the job today!
Don't blame me; I voted my conscious.
Let me tell you the story of how it all began. The year was 2016...
...and that's the plot of the fourth Planet of the Apes.
Hey, it was a wild ride.
I guess more wasn't a good deterrent.
Do you still say that you wouldn't marry me if I was the last guy on earth?
Raise the roof! You had to tell Alexa…
Yes, yes, you told me not to vote for him.
Well, at least we don't have to worry about Social Security anymore.
I guess that was stupid of me to describe what I'd be wearing, even if it's a blind date.
Gail's misuse of "literally" when she meant "figuratively" ruined her 20th anniversary.
Well, it was your idea to tour the Middle East after the inauguration.
Yes. If I was to do it all over again, I would still vote for Trump.
Is this trash pickup day?
Honey, trust me on this one. This area's up-and-coming!
I TOLD you not to schedule a party for after the apocalypse.
'Well, you were the one to suggest we do veganuary'
Do you really still think that his worst part is his Twitter account?
Nuclear codes, schmuclear codes. You had to send that Tweet!
You were right about Trump.
Look on the bright side, at least he brought us jobs...
So, this is what Trump meant by, "Make America Great Again".
Jane, I found your comments earlier very explosive.
You said, "ALEPPO stood for A Leisurely Excursion- Picturesque Panoramas Overseas".
Hey, I wasn't the only one who voted for Trump!
Did you remember your iPhone?
You voted for him, not me.
I accepted their ultimatum.
For better or for worse? This is worse.
But what about those e-mails?
Next time I will just ask for directions.
No, I don't have 99 red balloons.
I said Trump would make a change.
No, I did not leave the gas on.
"Vote for Trump," you said... "Everything will be fine," you said...
This is lousy, not great at all.
Let's take the Acropolis off the bucket list, shall we?
Well, this is "Great" in its own way.
Should I cancel the order for the bay windows?
Do you want to reconsider not having sex with me even if I was the last man on earth?
I didn't think he was going to start from scratch
I'm not the one who gave the puppy a chemistry set for Christmas.
I still say, lock her up!
"...it was just toast".
Will you be my apocalyptic wife?
Well honey, you always wanted a "clean slate"
I thought it was your turn to watch the kids.
Now we know there's life in outer space and they've been watching our TV news.
Don't worry, our government will save us
You never want to give anyone the benefit of the doubt.
You were right and was wrong. Okay? Get over it.
Okay, so you were right about the Galaxy 9
Don't look at me. You made the chili.
How many days until the next presidential election?
Sushi?
You're the one.. who wanted to live next to your mother!
We'll never save humanity with that attitude, Judith.
Don't look at me... It wasn't my tweet.
...so what do YOU think our divorce looks like?
I know, but who else is there?
The swamp is empty. Now what?
"So what's new with you"?
You said, "He'll kill us all!" WRONG!
But enough about that. How has YOUR 21st of January been?
No more Groupons for vacations!
I thought this mediation session went well, how about you?
I thought his tweet was a tad harsh.
When is this fucking acid going to wear off?
It doesn't feel 'great'.
I still think that our insurance policy had window coverage.
I told you not to tweet him!
See if the PR department can come up with a kinder, gentler name to describe our scorched earth policy.
I know what they're going to say. They're going to say we showed too much anger.
Me? I'm waiting for the midterms
To be honest, I think the old microwave was sufficient.
By the way, did you remember to close the windows?
Homes explode sometime, it's got nothing to with your mother coming to visit.
Looks like you need to reconsider.
You can't blame the Russians for this one!
At least we have our love to keep us warm
Whose idea was this anyhow?
This might be the time to work on our minimalist goals.
No, I don't need directions.
I am just really sad about the chicken I put in the oven for you.
My parents gave us these blocks.
So, I arranged to test your theory. Still sticking to that, 'Not if you were the last man on Earth" position?
Well I thought it was going to be a good investment!
No I'm not familiar with the 'broken window fallacy'
Buy you a drink?
Our insurer says campaign expenses are not covered.
Alexa, send me Apocalypse, Now.
Next time I'll remember that to close the gas valve, it's righty - tighty
Things that occur in the fog of marriage can defy explanation.
So Frank, do you still believe only he can fix it?
Service here has really gone downhill since Trump built the wall.
Next year we're going to Niagara Falls.
We could just spend one night.
I told you not to turn up the thermostat.
I still think we should take a wait-and-see approach here.
Just how long are we going to wait for your mother?
I told you not to vote for him.
I'm getting hungry.
Finally peace is secured!
I voted for Trump too.
That's it, honey - we're over.
I hope they don't delay our check-in time.
Told you it was risky, Meryl
Trump. Forrest Trump.
At least your economic anxiety is gone.
So, it's been a week and I still have ringing in my ears. You?
I thought "scorched earth" was to be taken figuratively; not literally.
Forget the FAKE NEWS. America is great again.
Why are you looking at me? I didn't vote for him
No Louise, I am still not sorry I voted for Trump.
Hard Rock Cafe's decor has really gone downhill.
I concede that Hillary was the lesser of two evils.
But the realtor called it a smoking deal.
Well, so much for 4% growth this year.
You've proved your point. What now?
I don't care what anybody says, I'm still glad I voted the way I did.
These theme restaurants are getting tiresome, Paul.
Did you leave the stove on again?
As much as I sympathize with what they are going through, I cannot give them a positive Yelp review...
This property is just brimming with possibilities!
OK. Next time we just won't vote.
When you said you entered us to participate in a cartoon with an edge I wasn't expecting this!
At least my dignity is still standing strong.
Earth isn't scorched--just feels like it after the election.
I expected that traveling to a war zone would give you a better perspective on life.
So Mrs. O'Leary, can you explain once again how your cow caused all this?
I thought he was the better candidate.
Yes, it's an all inclusive resort.
We can't meet here again.
Well I did it. So now, how are we able to get married seeing we are the last two people on earth?
Well, I can't wait to see his next tweet.
In retrospect, you were right, but at the time the e-mail server scandal swayed me.
Just because I voted for the guy, doesn't mean that it's all my fault!
What did you expect?Well we did vote for Trump!
So much for not settling.
So will you go out with me NOW?
Emma, would you be offended if I said, "DAMN!"
So, have you ever been on a blind date before?
What do you have to lose, he asks.

Me? I was hoping to make America great again.
Now, where were we before we voted?
Honey, I told you we should have said NOPE to the pipeline.
Urban renewal has to start somewhere!
You said this would be a peaceful inauguration.
any plans tonight?
You don't just grab the first empty table you see. That's anarchy.
So, how about now?
Did you call Barry "You are in Good Hands" guy to see if we are covered?
Don't worry, we're in good hands with Allstate.
I hate to say I told you so -- actually, I really don't mind.
January 20th can't come soon enough.
How do you feel about sex now?
at least we don't need to be politically correct anymore
Wanna dance?
I told you that Trump would bomb in New York !
Not what I pictured when I think of a 'start-up'.
You may want to rebalance your retirement portfolio.
For the record, I was not fiddling.
Actually I do feel fine how about you?
I thought our marriage was crumbling but I see now it's in complete ruins.
That is the last time we invite you in-laws.
On the plus side, it's very roomy and we don't have to worry about the neighbors.
We have each other.
And who did you vote for?
See what happens when you leave the toilet seat up!
So what? He's still got 3 years and 11 months to make America great again.
I told you our marriage is going down in flames.
I swiped right.
The divorce agreement entitles you to half the house!
I guess we should have read the small print on our reverse mortgage.
Isn't it great to be on the winning side
For 2020, we're thinking "Make America Gravel Again"
Is it just me or are you not happy here?
And that's when I said, "Shiva? Prove it!"
Did you turn out the light?
Yeah, and if she didn't have anything to hide, why did she need her own email server?
I can't remember what our homeowner's policy says about something like this.
Sitting petty.
Well, at least we didn't have another Clinton presidency.
Well, now we know for sure. You don't microwave a cat.
Dorothy and Toto should be along soon.
The Inauguration after party was a real blast.
I Thougt I Turned The Stove Off.
Imagine, if you can, a 24-hour concierge, pool and private roof garden.
Is your dad a terrorist 'cause you da bomb?! Too soon?
Did you hear something?
I don't HAVE an inside voice!
Three's a crowd.
Did you forget to check the pilot light on the furnace again?
Let's have sex.
At least Hillary isn't using a private email server.
What's your beef? I voted my way. You voted yours. My way won.
We should rebuild that wall.
De-cluttering maybe wasn't the best idea after all
They must have hit the wrong reset button...
I TOLD you not to vote for that nut-case!
At least it didn't knock over the recycling can.
You sent in the "HOMEOWNERS CHECK" this month,didn't you!
So I misunderstood the mortgage 'nuclear option'.
This is still nicer than being around your parent's.
What do you mean "at least now we won't have to eat my mother's cooking?"
How do you like me now?
Now, are you satisfied?
How's that wall working for you?
You're STILL the Coy Mistress!?
Hindsight in 2020?
Okay, you won't go out with a married man. Now what?
Of course you'll still get to use that Anthropology degree.
See I told you to vote. Now look at us.
How many times do I have to say it? Hillary was the better candidate.
That was no 'mild' fart
I told you I thought I smelled gas.
Don't worry, this is good for our Bitcoin portfolio.
Okay maybe I should've voted for her
So, how far do you think the "wall" is from here?
Really? Then let's eat out tonight.
I'm a builder.
I spy with my little eye.
Yes, but Hillary...
What a dump!
On the good side, I won't need to repaint the house.
You blinked! I win.
Well, it turns out you would go out with me if I was the last man on earth, didn't it?
Imagine if you really got mad.
Well, I heard from some very reliable sources that a brand new affordable medical plan will be offered in only two more days.
Eve of destruction my arse. It's 8 am
Mother was right about you.
Okay, so I promise to vote from here on out.
I miss the Kardashians.
We should have budgeted more for the reno.
We missed our deadline.
That just goes to show that you should never say that things can't get worse.
So tell me, why as a woman, did you vote for Trump?
This is me having an Aleppo moment.
Next time, I'm upgrading to business class.
In four days it will all be great again!
Well, ...now that I AM THE LAST MSN ON EARTH, will you go out with me?
Everything will be fine, as long as we have coffee.
I'm sorry. I've looked everywhere but I still can't find the remote.
I told you Putin had a short fuse.
It wasn't perfect so I blew it up. I've got vouchers if you need a doctor.
This is the first phase of President Trump's plan to "Make America Great Again".
Well, I think Vice President is quite an accomplishment.
I know it's not much now, but the real estate agent said in twenty years we could be living in the next Tribeca.
Would putting in a park bench or two be the end of the world?
Don't worry Joan; the TV remote is in my pocket.
Maybe you're just one of those women whose joy can't be sparked.
You just HAD to send him that tweet, didn't you?!
I guess that it can't be secret anymore.
Well, what do you think of Allepo?
Wait, how many more days is it until November 3rd, 2020?
They should have never criticized the Taco Salad. Sad.
Can't we just get along?
Well, I was worried about the e-mail server.
Scorched earth policy Ms. Conway!
I thought you said "the best house on the worst block"!
Well, after the election, things started to go downhill.
Maybe we should move to La La Land.
So much for open political discussions at Thanksgiving dinner.
ChernobylSingles.com
I know this is just a dream, but could you just this once please give me the benefit of the doubt
What's for dinner tonight?
Well, he didn't lie. That was tremendous.
Frankly, none of it sparked joy.
I thought we only were doing a bathroom remodel.
Sorry, just sat through Trump's press conference and I'm not in the mood to be funny this week.
My Fault?! You're the one that wanted a dog!
Raising pigs is a lot harder than you'd think, Melanie.
yooooouuu bitch !
I know you said "not until hell freezes over," but won't you reconsider?
"Will you bury me"?
Your point? It's not like he deleted any emails.
I gather that the jury has reached a verdict.
You said "anything from Pandora" . . .
Well, I wouldn't exactly call it urban renewal.
If Bernie Sanders had been the nominee this never would have happened.
See? Trump put us on top of the heap again.
He said that he would create jobs, bigly.
The Real Estate developers are getting pretty aggressive
We will make America great again.
Maybe now you'll finally shut up about global warming.
we should not have voted for him
We do have a lot in common said Freddie Mac to Fannie Mae.
Now what were we saying, before that rude interruption?
This neighborhood is blowing up
She didn't get into Harvard?
You're the one who insisted on a quiet suburb.
OK. I guess you were right. I shouldn't have voted that way.
Is now a good time to talk about divorce?
I told you voting for Trump was not a good idea...
Ma'am, this is the perfect time for me to demonstrate how our newest vacuum model blows away the competition at picking up dirt and debris.
...but on the plus side, the "comb-over" as a hairstyle is also done.
I'm pretty sure that I warned the kids not to burn the house down
Wait, I thought we both voted for him.
You're boring me
Looks like you're the last man on Earth.
Where do you want to go for dinner tonight?
The upside is we won't need a lawyer for the divorce.
So you voted for Donald?
Home wrecker? Me? What makes you think that?
Yes, now I regret that I voted for him.
Don't worry, he's going to make it great again. You can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs.
What side of the bed do you sleep on?
I told you that God would get us for voting for Trump.
On second thought, let's just order in some sushi.
Didn't I tell you a vote for a third party was a vote for the end of the world?
Don't blame me- I voted third Party!
I don't know about you, but I think our retirement plans are kaput!
I guess I didn't take "scorched earth" seriously when it was just a hashtag on twitter.
So, how does it feel to be Donald Trump's daughter now?
It's nothing fancy, but I call it home.
So how bad could Trump be, huh?
I told you we shouldn't let your mother move in with us.
And you said, 'Don't judge him on his Twitter feed.'
Remember "for better or for worse"? I think this is the worst.
There wasn't anything good on TV tonight anyway.
But tweets are not policy
Don't look at me. At least I voted for Gary Johnson so my conscience would be clear if this happened.
Making America "great again" is like making an omelet; you're gonna have to crack a couple eggs.
I told you he would make America great again
Well, we did say we no longer wanted status quo.
Lets procreate.
My favorite movie was, uncannily, "Apocalypse Now."
Should I leave and come back in?
Well, that was a kick in the head!
I'm American, what do I know? The travel agent suggested Aleppo.
Damn you, Nate Silver.
We'll always have Paris in '44.
I can't find my Kindle.
Yes, we're back in Kansas again.
I still say nuclear proliferation was his best idea.
Next year we are NOT booking holidays in advance.
Did you hear something?
No. I didn't forget to take out the trash.
Don't make me come over there.
I'm still worried about those emails.
Hell of a honeymoon, Doris!
I miss the old house too, but here, there is no state taxes.
How was I to know; all the travel pamphlets recommended it.
But those emails though...
Sooo... How are you liking me NOW?
The hotel listing said the view was panoramic
What's the best number to reach you?
But we ate there last night
CRUEL FATE: All the time in the world, now…and we get stuck with each other.
Hi, Winnie. My name's Estragon.
It had 4 stars in the travel guide!
I guess the Greyhound will be a little late.
I told you that after this election, their wouldn't be anything left.
I admit "lease to own" was a bad idea.
When they make the biopic, I want Alec Baldwin to play me
You said it would be cheap to live here and you were right.
Then there was this bang and the TV went black
Well, I didn't vote for him. ("I" in italics.)
Did you forget to open the window?
Once the bitcoin starts raining down, you'll thank me!
Wanna go to a movie or somethin'?
Again, you're right! Let's move to the suburbs!
Looks like it's going to be another boring Saturday night.
Looks like we're the new world Adam & Eve.
No, Kevin, I am NOT ready to forgive you for getting me a vacuum for Christmas.
I can tell you exactly what Aleppo is if you'll just listen to me.
They did say they were going to blow it up after the election .
It's just us now, and I can't remember if we're Democrats or Republicans.
I told you not to touch the remote.
You should have seen this coming when you tweeted that Trump had thin skin.
Well, everyone knows men can't read directions.
I blame the Russians.
Hell hath no fury like...
And you said there wouldn't even be anything left to sit on.
And where do you see yourself in five years?
I hope you're satisfied; you voted for him.
Lets give up.
Oh yes sir, mister. I saw you looking at that blonde right before the meteor hit.
Ok, all of your "even if you were the last man on Earth" posturing just became true. Now what?
You never want to go out any more.
We’re done here. Let’s go home.
I'd still vote for Jill Stein.
Armageddon is a perfectly good reason not to seek marriage counseling.
Did I leave the stove on?
The Giants lost.
I am prepared for this. I have ordered a daily meal kit.
I asked you if you left the stove on when we left
Are you trying to sabotage our relationship, again?
At the time, I thought it was cute when Trump liked nukes and knew more than generals.
No, I am the cornerstone of this community!
I'm tired of fighting, so let's call a truce.
Mutually Assured Seduction
Ever heard of a Golden Shower, Mildred?
Don't give me that look, it was YOU who wanted to downsize
Knocking down a few walls has done wonders for this place.
The attorney called it a "traditional" divorce.
They're not sending us their best people.
Something got you down?
Sorry, I forgot to take my Prozac.
I heard the new HUD plan will be good for jobs and the economy.
I used to come here before the war.
I'm beginning to think that somebody has an issue with us.
Okay...okay...you were right! We should have had the calamari in Monterey instead of the sushi in Fukushima.
I like your place.
Well, at least he's building a wall.
Ok, next time you wash and I'll dry.
That email server seemed so important during the election.
So do you want to try the mannequin challenge?
What do you want to do for lunch?
I voted for Jill Stein.
So, this looks like a nice spot for a garden.
He said something about having a bad hair day
I told you Trump was trouble.
Man, you've gotten fat.
Do you think it's too late to kiss and make up?
Who do you like for the Supreme Court?
'Best of all, it has easy access to downtown'
Will you be my Facebook friend now?
I guess I should have clarified what I meant by 'Fixer Upper' ...
So, did you finish your bucket list?
Oh NOW you want to get dinner...
At least we still have eachother
Who did you vote for again?
HE JUST WANTED SOMEONE OUTSIDE OF HIS COUNTRY TO SAY "WE LOVE YOUR HAIRCUT".
Is this good karma or bad karma?
Yes, Dorothy...I'd say it's a Toto loss.
We should have worked harder at compromise
It's not quite how I thought it would look .
Did you get the cigarettes out of the house?
I told you not to use a scorched earth campaign.
Maybe you and I got off on the wrong foot.
A brand new plan? Together this time?
Also, two or three weeks ago all the garden catalogues started arriving in the mail.
You're right. This place is da bomb.
See, hunny, I told you it was useless organizing that attic...
Does this job include room and board?
I have nothing to complain about.
I'm STILL not going to your mother's birthday party.
If we are the new Adam and Eve, aren't we a bit on the old side to be able to procreate and repopulate the earth?
I'm sure the waiter will arrive any moment.
I know, I know. It's a bit of a fixer upper, but what do you think?
I THINK WE WON!
Now that I'm the last man on Earth, perhaps you'd like to reconsider.
Well, I KNOW it wasn't me!
Where exactly was that red line again?
None of this would've happened if you just got over Hillary Clinton's emails!
I told you we shouldn't visit Iraq for vacation
No-one ever told me there'd be days like this.
I told you it was a fixer-upper.
Evidently your Samsung blew.
So, about that date....
What do you mean the apocalypse isn't a valid excuse for canceling dinner with your parents?
Dorothy, I am leaving you.
I knew he planned to drain it, but this seems like overkill.
Eat in, or take out?
Now you're just being a jerk.
Nice to meet you Eve, my name is Adam.
Is your apartment rent stabilized?
I asked you to turn off the death ray.
Don't you think our relationship is affecting other people?
The first 100 days have certainly gone well.
Consider this the reset to "Make America Great Again".
Home isn't quite like I remember it.
So I said if you really are Thor prove it.
I told you we were late.
You're right, dear. I shouldn't have kept saying, "don't worry, 2017 will be way better."
Hey, I liked that he was a straight-talker.
Did you bring the Dystopian-Bismol?
If you're expecting me to help repopulate, you're going to have to work on your role-playing.
Beans for lunch.
After all these years... Alone with each other...
How's life been treating you?
Well, at least now he can build his wall.
When I said "this means war" I meant it!
No more Tweets from the Tower!
That vacuum salesman seemed a bit odd.
I told you nothing would happen.
I knew we never should have given him the nuclear code
So, does the #3 usually run late this time of day?
I told you they didn't like us.
"Now that we've done the conflict-zone tour, I think I'm going to REALLY love it when the bus comes back; or any bus - to anywhere. How about you?"...
What are you cooking for tonight...
So, who are you going to vote for this year?
I still feel "he told it like it was".
Armageddon? No, never heard of it.
This area is really blowing up right now.
You happy? I'm no longer obsessed with Facebook.
Yes, the smoke bothers my eyes as well.
When you asked where I wanted to go for my birthday I said, " to see Rio", not "to Syria."
That was your "little" secret?
'' you were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off''
Do you think these pants go with the Apocalypse?
Checkmate!
Now are you sorry you took a bite out of my grilled cheese?
Don't blame me. I voted for Her
Do you think we can still call our Representative and complain?
Are you sure waiting here for a taxi is a good idea?
Your frustration notwithstanding, Bert, they clearly said they'd call our names when it was our turn.
So did you hear that Nick is The Bachelor?
It's 2am at the bar all over again.
Your love is intoxicating, or that could be the asbestos.
And so it goes.
Some idiot named Joe Dator is asking people to say something funny about our desolation.
He thought they were fake numbers created by a 400 lb guy sitting in his bedroom.
Don't worry--once the Republicans see your picture, they will allow you to enter the country as a refugee.
Don't blame me, I voted for Jill Stein.
Aleppo tried to warn us of those damn Russian real-estate agents....
WOW! The party was a blast!
Everything you touch turns to smolder.
Obviously, our options are severely limited.
You didn't have to start WWIII just because I forgot to pick up the dry cleaning.
This is the start to Make America Great Again.
So, you were saying...
Look, was that a definite "even if you were the last man " or a " I'll think about it?"
I think I love our little grandkids as much as anybody, but, I admit, when their parents come to pick them up I am not all that sad,
The realtor said there's been talk of bringing the train line through here. I say we hear her out.
Now doesn't that feel liberating
That was very impressive, but maybe a little extreme for a first date.
So if it's really the end of the world then why are you still here smarty-pants?
But, the Trump Tower still stands.
We're no longer in the fetal position. That's a step.
Hey, this is way better than having classified emails on a private server.
We can sit here as long as you want, but I still won't agree with you.
Remember when whoopie cushions were all the rage?
Is this the midlife crisis they warned us about?
So... how serious were you about that "not if you were the last man on earth" stuff?
So, I'll play Adam and you, Eve...
Do you believe in destiny?
I drove for Uber before all this crap happened. How about you?
You were right, I should have unplugged the coffee pot.
Hey, I didn't vote for him either.
I told you the apocalypse would come before our kids did.
This virtual-reality trend has gone too far.
I told you voting for him would be a YUGE mistake.
I'm gonna beat the hell out of you if you blame the Republicians one more time Henry!
Thanks a lot, Obamacare.
She who smel't it, dealt it.
Look on the bright side. Now we've got that open-floor plan you've always wanted.
I told you a vacation in Mosul would lead to this.
The issue is, we still have each other.
You from around here?
But just think if Hillary had won.
Time to consider Plan B?
Putin was serious.
Baby you're a firework.
Really, Sarah? Must you lay waste to the countryside every time I'm little late?
Happen to see my dry cleaning ticket ?
Dammit Richard
Okay. Now, let's talk.
Welcome to the Aleppo Visitor's Center. How can I help you?
Do you think you can make me some coffee?
Our neighborhood just isn't what it used to be.
I've had just about enough of you!
Well, here we are - the last two people on earth.
It you are thinking, we still have each other, forget it!
Don't you believe we're on the eve of destruction?
Still better than using private email!
I was thinking of the ruins of Palmyra, not Aleppo.
You must admit, DIY has been very good to us.
I knew we were in the wrong line at the airport.
A Clinton administration would have been worse.
Your sex strike ends now.
I guess the only thing we can do now is try to re-populate.
This neighborhood's really going downhill.
Well, as my profile says, I am not a zombie, so… what do you say?
``We can now eliminate the city condo. That leaves the duplex in the gated community or the suburban colonial. Any strong preference?''
You agreed, "Low cost, adventure vacation, off the beaten path" sounded interesting
So, are you an only child, as of today, or before all of this happened?
I guess someone didn't like his hair.
I don't care. I'd still vote for Jill Stein.
Any chance you meant to type minimalism?
Your brother is never on time.
I think it's a complete re-build
well; I guess the Russia relationship WAS wrong!
So as you can see, we are in a period of rebuilding.
I guess we won't be using that microwave anymore!
Trump said he's going to bring the factories back.
I told you Tommy's chemistry set was a bad idea.
So, this is what our real estate agent meant by contra-gentrification.
No, it's your turn to take out the trash.
Why can't you hear what's in my heart?
Indeed, Mad Max looked a tad more glamourous
Well, you voted for Trump...
Do you think George R. R. Martin survived?
Ok, ok. You were right. But you can bet there will be no Mexicans coming across the border!
Who knew dystopia would mean we'd be sitting atop our tombstones?
Frankly my dear I don't give a damn
I ask because your posture suggests you may be preoccupied by something.
Looks like its just you and me. Too bad you're a Republican.
Well, at least kids had to "Well, at least the kids have to move out.
I guess the blowout we had last week over increasing our 401k savings seems somewhat mild now.
I'm officially the last person on Earth, so get yourself ready for a visit from the love docta.
I think I'll stick to cooking Ramen Noodles.
I knew he was a brash sex-fiend ding-a-ling, I just thought he would be more interesting....
So the stove was on... Pizza?
No, you're the immigrant.
I was expecting problems with Trump, but not so soon.
But he promised to make America great again.
I thought you said you knew how to make coffee.
Disruptive innovation under Trump lacks nuance or even irony.
Have you taken out the dog?
I'm sure we'll get seated for dinner any minute now
But the travel website said this was a 'smoking hot' destination.
At least we are on the street where you live!
... and we can visit the grandchildren in June.
I always meant to take notes on how civilization progressed as far as yesterday.
This was one option. Moving was another.
OK, I promise. No fireworks at the next family reunion.
Can I call you later?
All right , who decided, the path less taken?
I think Mike Pence's Refugee Conversion Therapy will work. I already feel like only god can save me here.
I've got an extra ticket to the Keith Richards concert if you're interested.
Am I good enough for you now, Luverne?
This doesn't look half as bad as the South Bronx did.
I didn't vote for Trump..Did you?
But you said you were tired of neighbors
It said it was organic on the label.
What is Aleppo?
Aleppo isn't what it used to be.
I guess that puts a damper on our restaurant plans.
That is the last time we eat your "20 alarm " chili
Well, you're the one who always wanted to see Chicago.
I don't want to settle for "just someone".
Well, anyway.
Your turn to do the dishes tonight
So, what else is new?
This is all part of 'Making America Great Again.'
'cause that's what lawyers do.
I think this is what they call 'dystopian'
Look around you. It's not like you can be picky.
Go figure. Designated Survivor? That's what they told me!
Give him another chance.
That didn't spark as much joy as I thought
You must do something about your flatulence.
I told you this would happen.
Sure, we can make it great again!
I warned you I'd use the nuclear option.
Did you turn down the thermostat?
Yes, he had small hands, but all it took was one teeny finger to push the button.
I'd call our budget cuts a ponderous success.
You suppose we should report a power outage?
Road trip?
Too much chili powder and too many beans.
No, it's your San Andreas Fault.
At least he was good for trade.
No. I still refuse to apologize for my vote!
Let's get married.
I'm still glad that I voted for Trump.
And you're still dressed like it's 1949.
Well, I still think you're being a bit melodramatic.
I guess we arent in Kansas anymore, Dorothy!
And your garden could go here...!?
What cruel irony--my glasses are fine.
I love the smell of napalm in the morning ...
After you set the self-cleaning oven you left to avoid the fumes?
Let's not argue, it's chilly enough with the nuclear winter.
It was dirt cheap. The property was advertised as being in a slum renewal area
I can't believe these seats have no backs -- much less cushions.
They're implementing a new "work from home" policy.
What if we're really just living within a Trump tweet?
Well, it made America great again, so I'm all for it.
You've been wanting a new kitchen.
Well, I guess it's up to us.
Hot pockets!
So now, will you go out with me?
Is this what they call "meeting cute"?
Now look what you've done, Ollie.
I told you no one was going to show up to another one of your parent's anniversary dinners.
We still have Carrier, Martha!
I told you I had some trapped gas, I didn't know you did too!
We saved you a corner office.
I thought the inauguration was to be a celebration.
Well look dear, on the bright side, downsizing will be a snap.
Now that I am the last man on Earth ... I think I will test your reluctance to date nonetheless ...
do you suppose we will still have rent control
Two words: Donald Trump.
You're making mountains out of molehills!
Of course, maybe I DIDN'T turn the stove off before we left...

At least we don't have to write the neighbors again about their tree blocking our view.
I told you your temper would blow up som,eday.
Okay! I finally see your point. Our marriage is on the rocks.
This is not Trump's fault. It's the lingering effects of ObamaCare...
Trump asked, "If we have nuclear capability, why don't we use it?"
