They're willing to work nights.
Yes, I found my laptop. But, now I can't find my mouse.
They are demanding equal prey
I only needed one, but Costco makes you buy a whole case.
No, I have no idea why your computer doesn't have a mouse anymore.
Not whom, Miss Ferguson, who.
Mrs. Jenkins, you may have misunderstood me when I said. "Reserve Hooters for the office party."
HR says you're not allowed to refer to them as hooters.
Best damn owl salesman I've ever met.
Go ahead, ask what our first baseman's name is.
Knock. Knock.
I think the more appropriate question is "why".
Please tell me you see them, too.
I said, "Get me a table at Hooters, not a table of Hooters."
I'm sorry but they're all the same. No one's the wiser.
Knock. Knock.
Irritable Owl Syndrome. I've had it for years...
It's called irritable owl syndrome, but I have it under control.
You know how it is, you get one for Christmas and suddenly you're the "Owl" guy.
They've been turning heads all day.
Gladys, get me a BLT and nine mice.
They're going to keep asking until you introduce yourself to them.
They all know the difference between who and whom.
Corporate says we have a mole.
Yes, It's a veritable who's who around here.
Hire the one that said 'Whom'.
I appreciate the effort, but I'm pretty sure I said towels.
The early birds went home. This is the night shift.
One coffee and nine dead mice.
Next time don't use the speech recognition app to order towels!
Someone at Hogwart's must have hit "reply all"
Pick any... In my opinion, they're all wise choices.
This used to be their tree.
We had to close the branch.
I accidentally hit 'reply owl'.
No, they do not Tweet.
Well, because ten owls would be complete lunacy. That's why.
I've noticed you can't seem to take your eyes off my hooters.
Never get in a twitter fight with J. K. Rowling.
You can still turn heads, Miss Kranston.
HOOTUS - the real wisdoms behind the Bench.
Just the usual, please. Tuna salad, coffee, box of mice.
They'll work night shift.
We are the Who's Who of Who's Whos.
On the other hand, you'll notice our pigeon problem has disappeared.
You haven't mentioned my new glasses.
Calm down, Miss Frobisher. That remark was directed at my hooters, not yours.
Tell that Potter kid he's got to start using email like everyone else.
I used to give a hoot. Now I outsource.
Send one out to every branch.
Does displaying my hooters make you uncomfortable?
Says Who?
Top talon'd. They hoot in harmony.
Be a dear Helen and get us a cup of coffee and nine mice, would you?
I am still none the wiser
Beats us. He just showed up this morning, sat down behind the desk, and said he works here.
Believe me, Ms. Henderson, you'll know when I give a hoot.
Because I'm sick and tired of wasting time searching all over the office every time I want an owl.
They're here for the branch manager position.
Ok, so that's nine field mice and a double decaf espresso?
They all say they're on first.
I've named the new one Gorsuch.
A coffee and nine voles, Miss Fenway.
My ex has them on the weekends.
What did you think we meant by organic pest control?
The will was very explicit.
Honestly, I can't tell who's who.
If I can't comment on your hooters you can't comment on mine
I said the office was out of TOWELS.
You think I give a hoot?
We voted. It's mice for lunch again.
When they asked if I needed an owl, Frau Schultz, I said, "Nein."
Say "knock-knock.'
Night workers.
You can relax, Mr. Purdue. We caught the mouse.
Miss Nelson, I asked for a table at Hooters, not a table of hooters.
Meet the new night shift.
Well obviously Susan, I do give a hoot.
I just can't tell who is who.
The mouse problem has been solved.
Yes, but my next one's free!
Apparently, they heard this is a sanctuary city.
We're what's left of the EPA.
I have irritable owl syndrome.
I think you'll agree that I've successfully addressed our mouse problem.
Are you looking at my hooters?
Don't mention my hooters and I won't mention yours.
We did ask for "high-flying, wise visionaries who aren't afraid to eat the other guy for lunch."
Yes. Unless they're referring to the object of a verb. Then they say "whom".
Go ahead. Ask me a knock-knock joke.
I'm not saying "Knock, Knock," again.
I bet you can't guess their favorite band.
Ask them about the first baseman.
It's my defense against the rat race
Who's the wiser now Miss Jenkins?
Paper jam in the 3D printer again?
Get a picture and email it to my wife. I'm going to have to explain several charges to Hooters.
Because I don't give a hoot.
Ducks, Melvin. You need to get your ducks in a row.
I smell a rat, Doris. And so do my friends.
This is how many hoots I don't give, Ms. Patterson.
To you, it's a desk. To me, it's a tax-deductible endangered species refuge.
Soy Latte, two pumps, a hint of vanilla and no foam, plus a dozen mice.
You're to give these a 'comb-over' for Spicer's press briefing on the Supreme Court.
I asked my last assistant for towelettes and didn't have the heart to correct her.
I don't understand why Hogwarts can't just e-mail their tax forms like everybody else.
Frankly, Ms. O'Hara, I don't give a hoot.
"I believe the expression is "ducks in a row".
Don't ask us--he was here when we flew in this morning.
They're not as smart as they look.
They're not so much wise as sarcastic.
Ducks, owls, whatever -- let's just get them in a row, okay Ms. Selkirk?
Say "knock-knock.'
Escort them out. I'm sick of answering the same question.
I said the bathroom needed towels.
The night shift has arrived.
I'll have a ham sandwich, sweet tea, and 9 mice.
From what I can gather, the desk was made from their favorite tree.
Actually, I asked for nine towels.
Now that Gorsuch is in place and the nuclear option is history, tell the President we have the next Supreme Court nominees lined up...plus an extra for the cabinet.
If you saw the size of the rat in your office, you wouldn't ask.
Turns out I'm a wizard.
It's 'ducks in a row', sir - and it's a figure of speech.
Let me guess: all the dead mice in the fridge are yours?
I'd introduce you but I don't know who's who.
I need another mouse for my desktop.
They only want to work the night shift.
I asked for "towels" Linda!
I can't find my mouse.
I'm gathering my wits about me.
Is your mouse missing too?
Strange. Nine computer mice are missing.
For the last time, please tell Hogwart's to take us off their mailing list.
Never order bowls online.
For the last time, Meredith, my eyes are up here.
Well someone has to give a hoot around here!
I changed the new one's name from 'Garland' to 'Gorsuch'.
I said tax attorney, not TAXIDERMY!
Please have the deli deliver a ham and cheddar on rye and nine field mice.
Is that a new tie?
They're terrible with names.
Is that really wise, sir?
We are investing more in survelliance
Yes there are 9 now… The last ones name is Gorsuch.
I'd like to introduce you to our night staff.
There was a typo in our football article, so here are the entrants for the superb owl contest.
It's Hogwarts' spam
Symbols of wisdom or ruthless predators: either way, we can pay them as consultants.
Chicken salad on rye, coffee, and nine mice, please.
It's ok, they're service owls.
Yes, Horton. I hear it too.
Miss Miller, do you know anything about omens?
It's actually "whom."
Really, Ms. Scarlett, I don't give a hoot.
Miss Wilkins, you will begin with 'Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.'
It's a Model Supreme Court: nine old birds who don't give a hoot.
Eunice, when you leave the office at night, please close the window.
Towels, Miss Dinglebranch. Towels.
This is night owls. Early birds are two doors down.
They heard we were a predatory lender.
So this is all that's left of the EPA?
How dare you call me the crazy cat lady.
A tuna sandwich on rye and nine mice.
Oh, Miss Helpler, I'm way beyond having my ducks in a row!
The acceptance letters to the seniors at Hogwarts are ready to be sent.
Yeah, hi...the keyboard works fine but my mouse is missing again
It’s a ‘parliament,’ Ms. Simpson, not a ‘flock.’
No, sir, I'm almost certain the promotion department suggested giving a TOWEL to new customers when they open an account.
May I introduce the new Supreme Court?
We'll be paying them on an owly basis.
The new edition of Who's Who just arrived
Bill, I'm having some trouble with my m-o-u-s-e.
Is this wise, sir?
Alexa, I asked for a towel.
I'm not kidding, Trump plans to replace the entire Supreme Court!
Mother always told me: choose your friends wisely or choose wise friends.
Have you met our new branch managers?
We're being spammed by Hogwarts.
I like hooters. There, I said it.
Put name tags on them. I have no clue who's who.
What,Where,When & Why are in the lobby.
I wanted to soar with the eagles, but I'm middle-management.
We hired them to work the night shift.
You work nights, you make friends.
This isn't the kind of 'collective wisdom' I had in mind.
It appears you had another successful trip to Costco, Sir.
It's our new motto: 'The Company That Gives a Hoot!'
Oh. So you can see them as well?
Nadine, I have a somewhat unusual project I'd like you to take on.
Could you please bring us nine dead mice and a decaf latte?
Careful. They have Irritable Owl Syndrome.
Thanks, Gladys. I'll have the usual for lunch. Pastrami on rye, chips, a Diet Coke, and nine mice.
Yes, as a matter of fact, we ARE a 'fly-by-night' outfit. Your point?
What, when, why, where, but the greatest of all is WHO?
Please let maintenance know the mouse problem is taken care of.
No. I said I need more HOURS to get the job done.
As your new President, after great contemplation, these are my nominees to fill the entire Supreme Court!
Ms. Jones, I've gotten a distressingly high number of complaints regarding your parrot's abusive language.
Yes, I'm the night manager.
I guess word has gotten out about our mouse problem.
Can't you see I'm in a meeting?
Your 3 a.m. is here.
No, I'm asking you - who's my first appointment?
I'm here for the Hooters interview.
One of our owls is missing.
It's whom.
The new guys from corporate want us to focus less on "the how" and more on "the who"
I believe the correct word is 'whom'.
This desk was made from the tree they lived in
Around here, we don't ask "why".
Do it, do it, do it: Say 'Knock, knock.'
It's Monday. Of course I'm in a fowl mood.
My wife swears she sent me out for towels.
Nine mice and a vodka martini, Ms. Phipps.
When we are at work, it's Dr. Who.
I've come up with the solution for the appointment of Supreme Court Justices that should please both partys.
We're looking for someone who can come in during the day.
Once you tell someone you collect owls it quickly gets out of hand.
If I buy one more, I earn a free barn.
The takeaway? Don't order awls from a hardware store in Boston.
Surrounding yourself with an endangered species won't protect you from getting fired, Bob.
I said towels.
Costco.
Oh my gosh! When did you shave your head?!
They're ok with working nights.
Yes. And again sir, who is here and I don't know what is waiting outside.
I promoted THEM, because they're the only ones who give a hoot.
Crazy, you say? Well, maybe, but do you see any squirrels around here?
I accidentally clicked 'Reply Owl.'
Will you be needing any more owls before I go, sir?
We've just welcomed Mr. Gorsuch to the bench.
I'm working nine owls a day.
This week. Tiny Desk Concert. The Who.
It's spam from Hogwarts.
As a matter of fact, I do give a hoot.
Do these glasses make me look smart?
Guess which one of us is the supreme court nominee.
They were brought in as consultants on this year's edition of "Who's Who."
I think a better question is, "Why?"
And I suppose you thought my affinity for hooters meant something else?
Tell IT support I need another mouse. And please close the window.
I'm taking a break from the Internet.
I hardly think this is an HR matter. I only asked to see her hooters.
The EPA just cut all their branches.
Our pigeon problem is solved.
Ask them who's on first.
Laugh, but I haven't seen a pigeon in weeks.
Go ahead -- ask me anything.
We'll all have mice Margaret, thank you
Clever bunch. They'll find our mole.
You did ask me to order you Hooters for lunch.
They were all out of penguins.
What makes you think we are a " fly by night" company?
Why don't you just buy mousetraps, like everyone else?
I see the new secure mail server system has been installed.
Which one is Chief Justice?
Our department is moving to night shift only
Who who who who who who should I say is calling?
They were all asking, "Who?" and I thought, "Well, why not me?"
No, Mrs. Johnson, I don't give a hoot.
Bunch, flock, parliament, whatever. Just get the damn things off my desk.
Yes, they ARE very cute, Mrs. Gunderson, but I think mouse traps would have worked just as well.
Apparently I've been accepted to Hogwarts.
You are looking for whom?
Miss Johnson, could you settle an argument? Is it "who" or "whom"?
I don't know where they came from, but at least the pigeons have left.
This isn't the Hooters happy hour I had in mind.
Fire the cat.
Looks like spam from Hogwarts
Please tell Harry Potter to start using e-mails if he wants to contact me again.
Don't tell the pigeons. It's a surprise.
I got tired of employees asking ‘How?’ or ‘Why?’
They’re wiser and cheaper than the previous board and we no longer have a rodent problem.
I'm writing a whoodunit.
My mouse is missing again
I can't find my mouse.
Please don't say who again.
At this magazine, what, when, where, why, and how are secondary.
Something tells me, Miss Hadley, that this may be a fly-by-night operation we're dealing with.
Carl, would you know what might have happened to my computer's mouse?
Good news Stella. You're off the night shift.
We're in a tight spot, Margaret. They're asking me to name names.
They're having trouble with "whom."
Of course we'll need you to work nights.
Spam from Hogwarts.
Despite what you may have heard, Miss Jones, HR does not give a hoot.
I'm sorry ... the Supreme Court vacancy has been filled.
Miss Brooks, I ordered towels.
Personally my dear, I don't give a hoot.
Which one of you left a half-eaten mouse in the breakroom?
To whom are you speaking?
Why yes, I was raised in a barn.
For the last time, I didn't call you in here, Mrs. Hoo.
I call them my little Supreme Court.
I'm beefing up overnight security.
Pay no attention to the man behind the owls.
Ms. Hendricks, have IT send me up a new mouse.
Please stop staring at my hooters.
I'm old school when it comes to tweeting.
I left my barn door open.
Relax, Sharon. These are service owls.
Needed a hobby for my Match.com profile.
Sir,there's a pussycat waiting outside who wants to go to sea with one of you.
We just need the who, what, where and why. We have the "who" covered.
Admit it Frank. Working the night shift for 30 years has changed you.
Our email is down.
No, they don't make you look smarter.
Go ahead, pick an owl, any owl.
I'd like to return these owls, they keep saying "whom".
I keep losing my mouse.
You are looking for whom?
It may require working nights.
I want you to get rid of the suggestion box immediately.
Just answer yes or no—have you ever seen a mouse in my office?
Let's start again. I don't need a table for 9 hooters. I need a table for 9 at Hooters.
And what do you collect?
Marcy, I don't know either if it's to who they belong, or to whom they belong.
I understand that "where" and "when" are pressing concerns, but I'm focusing on "who."
Have you seen the mouse for my computer?
That's right, I run Who's Who.
No, Mrs. Hoo, I didn't call for you this time either.
In recognition of your 40 years of service, I'd like you to have one of these.
My wife suggested I take up bird watching.
They refuse to go to sea untill we rehire all the Pussycats.
I'm as perplexed as you Susan, but the doctor's orders were to keep a close eye on my owl movements.
'They offered free shipping'
Let's try this again, Ms. Beasley. Please order 9 towels.
Quit staring at my hooters.
I can't right now, i've irritable owl syndrome.
I see you guys have been at it all night.
Mrs. Skolnik, we've heard things.
My doctor says it's important to have regular owl movements.
Let us prey.
Yes, sir. The glasses do make you look smarter.
Ironically, Mort, this makes you look stupid!
We also need to know What, When, and Where.
Do you know where my mouse is?
Actually, it's "whom".
They're all trained killers with built in GPS and no empathy.
Not to be a stickler, but I think you meant 'whom'.
For the last time, it's "whom"!
I think we may have a diversity problem, Susan.
Yes, Linda. I hit "Reply all."
Wise guys.
Welcome to Who's Who
They're very good at the Who, but not so good at the What, Where, When or Why.
I've got a lot on my desk but I'll try to squeeze him in.
For the third time, my name is Janet and I work in sales.
Bring me the Hitchcock file.
In retrospect, I think the anxiety labradoodle would have been a better choice.
I've assembled a real whoos hooooooo to assist you.
Get me nine pussy cats and nine beautiful pea-green boats, ASAP!
On the plus side, I haven't found a pigeon on my desk in weeks.
Turns out they're more afraid of the mice than we are.
A cup of coffee, cream, no sugar, and nine voles.
If this doesn't protect my job here at the Department of Interior, then I don't know what will.
With the right marketing we can get these guys to replace the Supreme Court.
The new mousepad you got me seems to have attracted quite a bit of attention.
One more and I'll have a minyan!
I see you still haven't sent the Dumbledore letter.
I think you mean "whom"
The A.M.A. says that only with a 10th owl is it officially termed an 'obsession.'
Next year's "Bring your pet to work day" will have some restrictions.
Pick an owl, any owl.
It's bring your owls to work day.
These are all incredibly stupid. Bring me another.
They ask the questions, not you.
Regretfully, sir, I can't work for a messenger service that's fly-by-night.
H.R. said we can't call them hooters.
I just need one more and then I can get the set of steak knives.
To whom are you speaking?
Come on, Meredith, it's for my kid's school. Buy at least one. Jeez!
They can't all be on first, sir.
We're anticipating a resurgence in predatory lending
A box of field mice and a lot of newspaper, pronto.
Cream, no sugar, and nine mice
Frankly, I don't give a hoot if we have to work the night shift.
You don't have to say your name each time. It's a rhetorical question.
I think I've assembled absolutely the wisest cabinet ever assembled.
Only one therapy animal allowed, Stu.
Miss Pursley, please tell the exaltation of larks I'll see them now.
The ad said eco-friendly drones.
I'm not a people person.
Sir, you did say you wanted a team of blood thirsty carnivores that would work all night.
It's one too many owls, isn't it?
Who needs security cameras. They can swivel their heads 270 degrees.
Remember when I told you that my desk drawer squeaked?
Have you seen the mouse for my computer?
It's from WHOM did I get them, not from WHO.
It's high time we do something about the lack of vision around here.
'What?', Alice, is a REFRESHING question.
They're looking for my mouse.
Yes Ms. Jenkins--although it's a real hoot to work in this office, there is always a lot of crap to deal with.
We'll have five chipmunks, four field mice and a tuna salad on rye.
They really don't make you look any wiser
Apparently, more people give a hoot than anticipated.
Good news. The mice are gone.
Let's see. there's happy, dopey, doc, snoopy, lucy, kermit, curley, moe, and I forget the one on the right.
If you're not a varmint, Marjory, then you have nothing to worry about.
Have you seen my mouse?
I'm surrounding myself with wisdom.
Coffee, black, and a dozen mice for the owls.
You may send in the pussycats now, Mrs. Gundersen.
One ham and swiss on wheat, a diet Coke, and 45 field mice
What happened to the Penguin paperbacks?
Who's the wise guy now?
Owls are the new ficus.
It's what the Supreme Court is supposed to look like.
Bring me the Jones file and a bucket of mice.
Want one?
You said that you wanted to see my hooters. Did you not?
I said I wanted to be a night owl, not I wanted nine owls.
Is this the Hogwarts mail room?
Are you able to identify which one stared at you?
It's a start, but it still doesn't explain the hollering.
They're here to protest EPA funding cuts...and for the air conditioning.
Can any of them play first base?
Well, your taxes are done. They had to pull an all-dayer to finish them though.
Goddammit Howard, I said nine towels!
I got you Hooters like you asked.
Please get me a cup of coffee and nine mice.
There are precisely nine, Ms. Jones, so they will never become deadlocked on what to do with the gerbils.
Towels! I asked for a gift set of towels!
For the late shift, I said I needed a night owl - not nine owls.
I wanted a table for 9 at Hooters, not a table of 9 hooters!!
Unhackable.
Madam, this is the "who" department. The "what" department is down the hall.
Nine mice and a Caesar Salad, please.
Apparently, people have been abusing the "Reply Owl" button again.
This is a fly-by -night operation.
If it's a "WHO" question we can help
We use email here, Mr. Weasley.
Yes, they WOULD make a nice Supreme Court, but . . .
Their collective wisdom could easily replace the Supreme Court's.
I see nine wise old owls and one bird brain.
The word you are looking for is Parliament'. It's a 'Congress' of loons,
No, I said the washroom needed more towels.
Herbert, have you seen my mouse?
They don't give a hoot and neither do I.
Can't you see that I already have enough on my desk?
We're going to be working late tonight.
So who's working the day shift?
I can't resist a sale.
Not so foolish as your standing between them and their mother.
Yes Mary, for the last time, a fucking parliament.
On the bright side, we've solved our pigeon problem.
Not exactly what I meant when I asked you to book The Who.
I'm helping my kid raise money for his school. Want to buy an owl?
The pigeon situation seemed completely controlled and they asked for more responsibility
And why do you want to work at Hooters.
Oh, and J.K. Rowling called nine times.
The real question is, why?
You hooted, sir?
It's a veritable who's who.
Wait until you see what's in the filing cabinet.
No, I said I wanted nine outlets.
Can you prove my committee is responsible for the droppings on your desk?
Lots of Hogwarts mail today.
I would like to introduce you to our newly confirmed Supreme Court Justices.
Your 3 a.m. is here.
We believe these messengers can't be hacked.
I was told a nine owl day was the norm around here...
Meet the company softball team. Hoo's on first.
Housekeeping called in sick. Again.
Fixed the rodent problem.
Say goodbye to the office rodent problem.
Excuse me sir, but your taxidermist is on line one.
It seems I've been accepted at Hogwart's.
Tell the student assembly that I'm not any closer to choosing a mascot.
I know who. I just don't know why.
Can I give you a word to the wise?
I'm afraid of mice.
Ms Blake - By any chance, did I miss a Hogwarts tuition payment for Ida?
No one has a fax machine anymore.
It's a veritable who's who around here.
It's me, Janice, you're secretary. Why do you keep asking who I am?
They’ve agreed to help us find the mole.
They're benchwarmers for each of the Supreme Court justices.
What I need from you are the 'what,' 'where,' and 'why.'
I thought I'd add some hooting to all of my hollering.
I got the idea from Trump, Miss Crenshaw. Always surround yourself with the best and wisest council.
Did Mr Potter leave a forwarding address?
I told you, George, a full desk doesn't mean you're busy.
"Meet our new interns. They're a hoot".
Ask me if I give a hoot.
Nancy, would you mind printing a return label for these owls? I ordered the wrong size.
Can you pick up a few dozen field mice at lunch?
They heard we've been working on a better mousetrap
Overkill, Lois? Well, you don't see any more mice, frogs or field snakes, do you?
Nice set, sir, but I'm still not showing you mine.
OK, you do look wiser.
You have messages from Roger Daltrey, Alfred Hitchcock, and Temple University.
Get me What, Where, When and Why.
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a hoot!
Yes, the glasses make you look smarter. The owls -- not so much.
Ten, or no deal.
I figure my job is now protected by the Endangered Species Act.
The mousetrap doesn't have to be organic next time.
They are wise and they are predators. Don't you forget that, Mrs. Jennings.
"Clean up on 'owl 9.'" It was a joke Ms. Smithers.
"I don't care how what your advisors say, it's 'whom'.
I thought we could use more hooting and less hollering around here.
We tried the mousetraps, Mrs. Kravitz, and we tried the cat- but now we are going to try it my way.
I'm replacing the annual year-end bonus with my new 'give a hoot' program.
They mulled it rigorously. It's 'whom'."
Despite my colleagues opinion, the correct word is "whom".
I'm afraid of mice.
But, unlike drones, they require no FAA approval.
I said I needed a Night Owl for the project. Not Nine Owls!
Actually, it's whom, not who.
Your obsession with hooters is making me feel uncomfortable.
Take a letter, Miss Bronson. And an owl.
This used to be the Night Desk.
You can cross 'rodent infestation" off the list of grievances.
For the last time, it's "whom"!
Nine dead mice and a macchiato please.
Welcome to Whoo's Whoo in America.
I don't care how many of these owls you make to give POTUS, they still won't make him wise.
Stop staring at my Hooters
If that's all, Miss Felson, I'd like to get back to regurgitating into their mouths.
Actually, I really don't give a hoot Ms Guthrie.
Show in Mr. Pigeon.
They're willing to work the night shift.
Please stop staring at my hooters.
I told them I don't know, but they all keep asking me the same question.
Unusual yes, but try and find a single vole in this office!
They came with the tree.
There's something different, are those new glasses?
Choose the best one for yourself and then send the others in for their bonuses.
Frankly, I don't give a hoot what the rest of the office thinks.
For the last time, it's who not whom in this case.
Alice, you're going to have to stop shopping at Costco.
You realize sir, there's an app for that.
This is not what I meant by improving our corporate vision!
Stop staring at my Hooters
Another letter campaign from Hogwarts, Mr. Senator?
At least the snakes don't bother me anymore.
Wisest decision I ever made!
They may be wise, but they still can't reach a concensus.
This isn't what I meant when I said I'll have Hooters for lunch.
Choose wisely
I asked you to book 9 holes.
I used to have coffee mugs, but people kept taking them.
Meet my Cabinet.
A word to the wise Ms. Fitch.
Not 'who.' Whom.
It's a trade off--more hooey, less fake news.
I like to say that I have the biggest hooters in the company.
Email is down again.
Helen, this guy's in our chair again.
I thought you said you wanted hooters for lunch, Sir.
Because pigeons would be nonsensical.
Apparently, Hogwarts won't take 'No' as an answer.
More airmail from Hogwarts?
Frankly, I don't really give a hoot. And neither do they.
They were the only ones who would work the night shift.
...because at Hoot, Beak, and Clawamouse we have traditions, Alice.
Sorry, whom.
