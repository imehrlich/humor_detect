I see myself in so much of his work.
I was young and needed the money.
It's a forgery. The original is only a half-mile from where I live.
It's a little pedestrian, don't you think?
You can almost hear the car coming.
This one is good, but I literally couldn't stop looking at the headlights exhibit.
"Male leaping one lane of the Interstate" was powerful, but "Mother and Child contemplating I95" is beautiful.
Frankly, I'd rather see signs warning us of cars.
I didn't get it at first either, then it hits you.
I'm telling you: it's a sign.
I'd brake for her.
Whoever DOT is, I really like her work.
I don't get it.
So simple, yet they really jump out at you.
We use to walk on four legs?
Oh, please, every work of art reminds you of your mother.
Imagine the impact it will have.
These are from back when cars had drivers.
He was edgier before he got a grant from the Highways Department.
Who lets their kid walk in front?
It's thought-provoking, yet instills me with a sense of caution.
His work is displayed all over the country.
His "yellow series" perfectly captures the essential conflict facing a deer in modern society.
This one doesn't leap out at me the way the others do.
It's a little too middle-of-the-road for my taste.
Sadly, too many thought it meant 'Cross Here.'
The maternal doe, the bounding stag...even their caution signs were sexist.
Don't look up or we'll be here all night.
These overhead lights are quite ironic.
The message is clear - "Black deer matter"
I think it's a sign.
Sadly, too many of us thought it meant 'Cross Here.'
This one is entitled, "The Buck Stops Here."
They were run over by a Tesla, never heard it coming.
It's so nice to see his work not riddled with bullet holes.
It's no Picasso, but it's better than "Watch For Falling Rock
Yep. Mom and me. No permission asked. Not a penny in royalties.
I guess not all artists can make a decent buck.
I've never cared for street art.
Nobody could model like her. She stopped traffic.
At first I didn't understand the art, but then it hit me
Now that you mention it, I have seen his work everywhere.
I hear after the exhibit closes here, they're taking it on the road.
That's my first wife. She got custody.
The art is subtle, but then it hits you.
I think his work stands as a warning to us all.
I could've bought that in Vermont for ten dollars a few years go.
I know I am supposed to be looking at the art, but I can't help staring at the lights.
I find it fawning and pedestrian.
Why don't they ever show dads with kids?
Unfortunately, the buck didn't stop there.
The portraits are inspiring, but I prefer his falling rocks.
This one's on loan from the Taconic State Parkway
They already have guns and now they're telling them where we are!
Wish they'd turn the spot lights off so we could leave.
Personally -- I prefer the artist's "Slow Children" period.
'The headlights on the ceiling really capture the moment.'
Her work has become more reflective.
I'm still partial to his "Caution: Falling Rocks" phase.
Maybe it's the lighting, but I can't look away
For a moment, I thought it was the ladies' room.
Stereotyping us again. This is why they think we all look alike.
Fine, Ill admit it. I posed when I was younger. I needed the money to get me through art school.
Stop staring at her ass...
They're only here for another week, then they go on the road.
These aren't originals. I've definitely seen them somewhere before.
I can't believe I'm finally seeing the original, I passed hundreds of reproductions on the road here.
I hear this show is going on the road.
I don't care what the critics say. This is much better than the "Slow Children Playing" exhibit over at the Whitney.
He's done similar work elsewhere but it's been very pedestrian.
Ah, 'Mother and Child' by Doe Vinci.
Turns out these didn't mean safe to cross.
Nice to view street art without someone honking at us.
We came all the way into the city to look at this?
I feel the artist is trying to warn us about something.
This transcendent piece is more than mere art. It's a sign.
Frankly, I find it rather pedestrian.
This one's by "DOT", who's DOT?
I think it's a sign.
I remember when Myrna posed for this. Ironic how she died.
I'd say this was his cautionary period.
I see it as a cautionary tale
I love DOT's madonna-and-child paintings most of all, don't you?
This is stuff we've seen a thousand times, am I right?
Well, it's certainly reflective.
I see the series as a cautionary tale.
Too pedestrian for my taste.
I still prefer his earlier No Hunting work.
You’ll love the headlight exhibit in the next room, it’s mesmerizing.
Good. They still don't know we can stand.
I just don't get street art.
Ironic. The artist died of Lyme disease.
This one always stops me in my tracks.
This one doesn't jump at you as much as the others.
I like it, but where would we hang it?
Don't look up, or we'll be standing here all day.
I think this one was used for family restrooms.
The value of this artist's work has risen dramatically since...well you know.
The way the light hits - it just stops me in my tracks
This one always stops me dead in my tracks.
He's missing an antler. This must be a VanDoe.
I wanted my art to engage with the automobile. Then it struck me...
This one makes me cross.
Intellectually it’s great execution, emotionally it’s still “deer in the headlights”.
I don't know, it just seems like the 'Madonna and Child' thing has been done to death.
No wonder people hit us, we don't look anything like that.
I thought this was the sign for the family restroom.
These are photoshopped - nobody has a figure that perfect.
It used to seem original, but now he's just repeating himself.
I've run into his work before.
What do you think she's trying to get across?
It's so lifelike I can almost hear the car coming.
This is weird; I think I went out with her.
I can't believe they bought all this art for three bucks!
UNNUMBERED ARTIST PRINTS ?? HA !! Try inmate overruns.
The artist captures a certain sense of peril. Don't you agree?
Makes you stop and think, doesn't it?
I wish they'd turn off these lights so that we could move on to the next sign.
I like the artist's earlier work...this period was so cautious.
Sublime! You can FEEL the headlights on them.
It would work beautifully in that space we have between the forest edge and the highway
Is anyone else startled by the headlights coming from above?
Don't feel bad, signs add about ten pounds.
Typical Jane Doe feminism. Note the minimalist antlers.
It's a bit pedestrian.
I especially appreciate the way that the color scheme and the diagonal format heightens the sense of existential angst.
I couldn't get anywhere with her, and now she's a nude model.
That was back in the day when we walked on all fours.
It kind of ruins the element of surprise, don't you think?
I gotta be honest, I don't get it.
Kind of makes you stop in your tracks.
These pictures remind me of my days on the road.
It captures both the stark isolation of the single parent and the inevitability of life's progression...
Nice art work, but it only tells guys with guns where we like to cross the street.
It's from his black and yellow period.
Way back then deer ran on four legs.
I just feel like contemporary art has gotten too safe.
The artist is a deer friend.
This one makes you really slow down and think.
I see it more of a cautionary tale.
That was taken right before they crossed over.
I'm compelled to cross the room every time I see it and I don't know why..
I find them a bit pedestrian.
The paintings are much more calming than the taxidermy exhibit.
A true genius, and he made our world a safer place.
The artist was never able to shake those early years in Public Works.
I see the price has gone up since the artist was run over.
These pieces date back to the Xing dynasty.
Do you think it's a sign?
Hey, isn't that your ex ?
A clever appropriation of the Lascaux cave paintings, don't you think?
Do your folks know you're now modeling in the nude?
Ah, so this is where the buck stops.
This is from his Headlights Period.
I find them pedestrian
This is a substantial improvement over her "yield" period.
She wants big bucks for it.
I love his yellow period
Late Human work. They became extinct after an orange man pressed a red button.
This one stopped me in my tracks.
It says the artist painted these during his reflective period.
This is why I don’t care for his later work. It’s so commercial. I literally see cheap copies of these everywhere I go.
Just don't look up at the lights, Andrew. Andrew? Andrew?
I understand the artist will be taking this collection out on the road?
I don't know Mel, I thinking using car headlights for the lighting is a little too conceptual.
No wonder they keep hitting us - their signs are all in museums.
Sure, his work is everywhere, but I still don't get it
Not bad for street art.
Do you ever feel that you're not the audience?
It used to be a deer crossing before Trump built The Wall
In my day, crossing was more of an adventure.
Try to see it from the driver’s perspective.
I saw his installation on I-95. It stopped me dead in my tracks.
Oh for heavens sake dear, I meant nice rack, as in antlers.
Dan hit a human last week.
You may very well call it art, but I call it signage.
She finally left me to get the big bucks.
Her "Headlights" exhibition was breathtaking.
It's a little pedestrian.
Much less pedestrian than his earlier works.
Like all good art, suddenly it hits you.
And in those days, everyone used all four feet.
The civilization that created such art must have had great respect for our species.
We've got to get over our victim mentality.
I could see how you could get struck by this.
I knew her before she became a model.
It's a van Doe
Someday we'll be able to cross wherever we damn well please.
Are you sure it's an original? It looks very similar to one I saw southeast of Denver on Highway 40.
I don't know, they look harmless enough to me. Shouldn't the warning be a silhouette of a car?
After the accident one senses a certain vulnerability ...in his works...
Simplistic - yes. Still I can't help but feel a sense of impending peril.
... in the days before we started shooting back.
I'd hit that.
No, it’s Romanticism. Realism would have bullet holes.
I knew him when he was still painting stop signs.
I thought this was a stag show.
Fox News was right, we were being targeted.
frankly i have seen better art in a cave.
As if we needed permission.
Aren't they lovely? The artist is a deer friend of mine...
Static and maternal, yet haunted by a certain "caught in the headlights" sense of impending doom.
D.O.T.'s masterpiece. Unfortunately, we know so little about him.
It's a matter of depth perception; is this a mother with child, or is it 2 deer . . .one near and the other far?
I know a cave where you can see this sort of stuff for free.
The lighting really brings you to a standstill
These humans haven't come very far since the days of their crude cave paintings.
I don't know what it means but I like it.
This is really very pedestrian.
Street art just looks wrong in a gallery
Do you feel objectified?
"This is a departure for him. He's been in such a rut lately".
I still prefer his Moose Period.
Where have I seen this before?
This is Gary's Yellow Period.
Why are they walking on all fours?
The plural of deer is deer?
I'm not sure why, but each work seems to express the fleeting nature of existence.
This one is called "Madonna and Blitzen."
Innocence, but with a sense of foreboding.
My kid could paint that.
He's brilliant with profiles, but nothing brings out a subject's eyes like headlights.
This is hopelessly derivative. But I like that there are no bullet holes.
This would go great in our driveway.
You've seen one Madonna and Child, you've seen them all.
I like it, but where would we put it?
I actually prefer his Leaping Period.
This is still considered pornography to some conservative groups.
Is the one on the left smaller, or just further away?
Let's not walk home.
What do I see? The artist seems to be addressing it only from the car's perspective.
This one's only a buck.
She took Bambi and walked out on me. All she left was a deer John note.
I heard he started on I-87.
I'm feeling a sense of.... caution, alertness.
It makes me cross when they’re unsigned.
It was from his "Crossings" Period.
I waited by one these signs for weeks and never saw a damn doe.
The lack of bullet holes indicates an outstanding example of the genre.
They draw even worse than they drive.
It's well worth two bucks, but is it art, my deer?
They're all a bit pedestrian, don't you think?
Well, it's no 'Falling Rock.'
It would be more effective if it were a picture of a speeding car.
I see a lot of myself in his work
They're just road signs. Next thing you know, soup cans will be considered real art.
Maybe it's something about these two beams of light, but I just can't look away.
We can't be certain, but we're fairly confident it's an original Jane Doe.
I don't know; it seems a little pedestrian to me.
I wanted to be a model, but I'm not comfortable with people staring at my rack.
See how the child is leading the mother? Remarkable insight.
I wish they'd leave children out of it.
At last, an art exhibit I can understand.
My grandfather still talks about walking on all fours.
His Madonna and Fawn is a feminist credo with overtones of existential angst while Stag at Dawn is a show of masculine domination. On the other hand, his Rampant Stag is so derivative and deserves no better fate than to be hung by the side of a road.
I see myself in the entire exhibition.
It strikes me as cautionary.
Another clever social statement, Mortimer. The bucks run free while the doe is left to shepherd the fawn across the road.
I find his new work rather pedestrian.
I've just never found Nudes to be interesting.
I probably won't get it until its too late.
It just doesn't say "WATCH OUT!" to me.
Pedestrian
I'm not usually a fan of Asian Art, but this Deer Xing speaks to me.
Was he ever that young? Were you ever that thin?
Still never any acknowledgment of stay-at-home dads.
Zero-emissions, they never heard it coming...
I just find his work so pedestrian.
It's a wonder our ancestors survived at all, really.
What kind of artist entitles this "Deer in the Headlights"?
Way too cautious for my taste.
Ironically, the artist jumped in front of car last month. They're worth millions now.
Call me old fashioned, but I'm not a big fan of nudes.
Why do they always make us cross in the middle of the highway?
It looks like everyone came stag to the opening.
Bambi and his mom, just before... well, you know
It seems that we must have been worshiped by the extinct homo sapiens
Now this one's definitely "middle-of-the-road."
We could have saved 20 dollars and seen it on Route 109.
Highway-life imitating Art.
Works for me, but will humans pay attention?
The antlers seem to follow you no matter where you stand
I prefer the angst of the artist's later Headlights Period.
Yep, that's my wife Margaret and our son, Allan. That picture is famous all over the world now, and they didn't get a dime posing for it.
I don't know, I'm finding the new works a bit pedestrian.
It speaks to me of the fragility of our lives in the face of unyielding technology.
It speaks to me, because, in a way, we're all crossing.
No bullet holes. Probably a fake.
It was a dangerous time for our people.
A Madonna and Child—it must be from his early period.
If I recall, this one is "Madonna and child" by Elk Greco.
Does looking at these make you cross?
This one doesn't jump off the canvas like his others.
I liked it better when he just did big soup cans.
And here the artist bucks the classsical school with a radical feminist perspective, challenging motorists' misconceptions with respect to windshield replacement theory.
I'd pay a buck for it.
So, if I don't have a fawn or a large rack, which restroom should I use?
I understand it was their last picture together.
I understand the artist also does Stop signs.
A bit pedestrian, in my opinion.
It's how the humans viewed us before the uprising.
This is his first indoor showing.
She was always so beautiful in the headlights
I posed nude for that one.
The artist really captured that "caught in the headlights" look.
Acknowledging single mothers, I like it!
There's absolutely no context. I don't get it.
They didn't pay attention until we started carrying the Lyme ticks.
I think it says something about the fragility of life.
They distracted motorists so the DOT replaced them with crosswalks.
The use of headlights is stunning.
I have no idea what the artist is trying to say.
'I can almost hear the cars'
I remember when that was taken.
It doesn't really stop you in your tracks, does it?
These things are wasted on the highway.
Wildlife art. Really, it's just one step up from oil on velvet.
I've always found the works of the New Hampshire Department of Transportation to be a tad pretentious.
It's OK, if you like still life.
she looks like my first wife
He's made great strides as a crossover artist.
This truly captures the plight of the single mother.
And this one, son, cautions the consequences of unprotected rutting.
A little pedestrian for my tastes.
I dated her
20,000 years later and still can't hold a candle to the ones at Lascaux.
One has to wonder, are they ever going to cross?
Who painted this one?" "Van Doe.
I still miss Mom.
This is all very nice, but you notice that they don't show you any with the guys in the orange vests holding rifles.
Don't get me wrong, it's a great piece. I just can't keep my eyes off the recessed lighting.
Tell me again how mom died.
You know, I don't miss humans but they sure could draw!
I could do that.
This is her most pedestrian effort yet.
Another one from his yellow period.
It says the artist never lived to see his success.
The warning signs were all there, but so often we just ignored them. That's the real tragedy.
Clearly, they idolized us.
It's how the humans viewed us before the revolution.
... and while I don’t do impressions, I was impressed with the impressionistic impress.
Humans had a very limited vocabulary as you can see by these hieroglyphics
Alas, the winning entry is wrong. The cartoon image is not of stocks, but of a pillory. Stocks were the seats at which you thrust your legs through two holes.. The apparatus where you put head and arms through holes is called the pillory.
Too bad they're all unsigned.
I've always felt something is lost when street art is commodified.
I just remember her as a dirty double-crosser
I don't really understand what the artist is trying to say.
I’ve got a year-old fawn who can draw better than this.
The show goes on for the next two miles.
So why the hell don't they put up the signs where we can cross??
My fawn could paint that.
Beautiful, but honestly, I could do without the "doe a deer...." soundtrack!
It's believed that primitive man once used these signs as warnings of our take-over.
Other openings have refreshments. I's appreciate this more if i had some pinot noir and a salt lick.
His work is getting a little cautious, don't you think?
Racial profiling is everywhere...
They say his art is dangerous, but away from the highway, it just seems derivative.
This piece represents the post-Antler period.
Can you believe our grandparents had to deal with humans driving their own cars?
These are ancient drawings made by humans before we took over...
I feel like I've seen this work before.
I'm glad they took these signs down for the exhibit, even if it did cost a few bucks.
I don't really get it.
I'm glad we saw this before the collection goes on the road.
By not including the bullet holes he begs us to ponder. A world without hunters or a world where hunters are too drunk to hit the sign?
He never really did come out of his Yellow Period.
I remember. I met her at a stag party.
I can't focus without headlights.
I believe the silhouettes represent the duality of nature
I never much cared for the stuff from his Yellow Period.
This is a nice tribute and all, but they did replace these signs, right?
Really makes you slow down and look, doesn't it?
Too much negative space.
All I can say is, I hope nobody thinks we really look like this.
Personally, I don't approve of nudes.
So that's how you were spending your Thursday afternoons; posing in the nude for some hack artist.
These are nice but I'd avoid the headlight exhibit, I was stuck there for hours.
It’s well executed, but I’m not wild about street art.
I still think having a car on the sign would be a more effective warning.
You can just feel the headlights
Perhaps it's a sign.
I'm just not sure people will see where he's coming from.
It’s too cautious.
I see it as a cautionary tale reduced to it's basic forms.
I don't know...something about it makes me cross.
His work really reflects us.
I'd never noticed, but you're right. They do always depict the woman looking after the little one and the man bounding off alone.
I'm sorry, Phil. This artwork does not inspire me. It's the kind stuff you would see on the side of the road!
I mean, I get it...but I don't really GET it.
This one is rather pedestrian, no?
I remember when we used to walk on four legs
It's so pedestrian.
His early work could really stop traffic.
I could never get into street art.
Where's Gary Larson when I need him?
I think it's called "Madonna with Fawn."
Call me old fashioned, but I still think we look better in the headlights
I'd have loved to see what Charles Addams would have done with this.
I call this one "Drive like your kids live here."
I never really understood the perspective of the "Express Way" artists, but then it hit me.
Why do they always make it look like we walk around on our hands?
I find it rather deerivative.
It's from his Hazard Yellow Period.
It really stops you in your tracks.
Sadly derivative.
It's definitely stronger than the duck crossing exhibit
I love how the artist has captured the nuanced oppression
It says "On loan from the Wisconsin Department of Transportation."
It doesn't capture the `staring into the headlights` moment.
Reminds you of your own mortality, doesn't it?
So this is what the Buick sees.
At least it's not a soup can.
These signs were supposedly produced by the human species before they became extinct from our deer tick.
It is the lack of bullet holes that makes this such a rare and exquisite collection.
"It's called, "Headlights"! "I could stand here all day and just stare"!
You wouldn't know the artist was in a rut before painting this.
Seriously, using headlights to illuminate the images is in poor taste.
This one is from just before Bambi's dark phase.
I TOLD you we should have gotten the audio guide.
The artist is clearly at a crossroads.
My theme was absent fathers.
It lacks the urgency of his other work.
And this is supposed to stop traffic?
My fawn could draw that.
I'm telling you, the one on Route 429 is the original.
I do love the classics.
It's a bit too pedestrian.
Where is this glorious yellow land? I find it quite calming.
We're feeling out the art market before sending them to the Department of Transportation.
It's shocking that the government pays artists to paint nudes.
It's peaceful but with an aura of danger around it.
Genius the way he always uses the yellow and black.
Here we are, standing at the intersection of life and art.
I posed for that picture with your grandma way back in 2014.
Son, now you see what I saw in your mom.
Why do I have an overwhelming urge to cross the road?
Something about the lighting in this gallery... it's like I can't move
He really captures the essence of crossing.
If they only crossed where this sign was,they'd still be here.
After a while, they all start to look alike.
His "In The Headlights" paintings were much more realistic.
Don’t you think it would be more effective if the headlights were positioned behind us?
These signs used to tell humans to look out for us, before we took over.
I used to date the model, you know.
Some view his work was a warning to all of us.
His work has finally gone from street art to high art.
The artist makes us appear so one dimensional
Two-dimensional art is profiling, and three-dimensional is taxidermy.
It's from his venison period.
Representational,with a tonality of the abstract.
Let's stay here until hunting season is over.
I could do without the headlights.
These are all just such tired clichés.
I call it Bambi Gestalt.
What do you think it means?" "Well, Deer, I think it's a sign.
I didn’t know she had a baby
Look, this one is signed Jane Doe!
She always has to play the Bambi card.
This, of course, is an idealization of the parent-child relationship.
The bucks stop here.
It’s quite abstract, but I imagine this piece is intended to represent love, family and death.
I guess it's true, art really does imitate life.
And I've got just the perfect spot...the crest of that big hill on Hwy. 32.
It's from his "yellow" period.
They're charging a buck and a half for it.
The buck didn't stop there.
Just because they're nudes doesn't mean they're art.
And yet for every life his roadside art saved, two were lost by informing hunters of our whereabouts.
It's all art 'til someone sticks a red nose on it.
It's too derivative
But then came the rebellion.
I'm guessing cave paintings of some sort.
And with this one, don't worry if it's doe or buck — it's a family restroom.
I've always been fond of his Yellow Period.
About time they put in a family bathroom.
And yet underneath the idyllic facade I sense the threat of sudden violence.
He was one of our finest crossover artists.
I don't like the way it's always a doe and a fawn. It makes it seem we bucks can't be good parents, too.
So, do you think this is really where the buck stops?
I've never much cared for symbolism.
I pay for four years of art school and this is what he does?
You really think we all look alike?
Frankly, I find the artists depiction of deer continually crossing roads, both clichéd and degrading.
I'm starting to think we shouldn't be here.
Does this sign make me look fat?
It lacks depth.
The headlights shining down sort of bring it to life.
I really like it when the aesthetic meets the practical.
I actually like his earlier work...STOP......CURVES AHEAD....and 50 MPH.
Would it be wrong to call it impactful?
Just looks like another Jane Doe to me.
The artist displays a startling lack of perspective.
These models set an impossible standard.
I think his work is too safe.
I think the artist is trying to tell us something important.
It's a shame his work has gotten so political.
This painting caught Walt's eye, and the next thing I knew, I was Bambi. Hate that name, but it still pays the bills.
Yes, my Son, that's your Grandma and I
Yes, of all his allegories, this one best serves as a caution to us all.
This entire exhibit is a diversion. We need tunnels, overpasses, and lower speed limits.
The signs were there, yet no one saw it coming.
These NRA-sponsored shows drive me crazy.... Why I still come I just don't know.
His early work with the DOT was very fruitful.
You’d think we never learned how to cross a road.
The headlights in the ceiling really tie it all together.
Realism? It's like he thinks we only ever go the left.
It's creepy how the eyes follow you.
Well, to me it speaks to the fragility of life in an uncaring universe
I'm not a big fan of his yellow period
Too soon.
Pastoral? Sure ...but layered with impending doom.
I find it rather pedestrian.
We paid a buck to see this?????
Just another cautionary tale.
I’m just curious – why always yellow?
The artist asks us, why DO deer cross the road?
This worked better as an art installation on I-80.
I've seen the original on Interstate 90
For some reason, this is the one that leapt out at me.
I'd hit that.
I'm beginning to sense a theme in this artisr's work.
I find it rather deerivative.
It says these were road signs from the Industrial era; when we walked on all fours.
Which restroom? I never know anymore!
There's something about it that stops me in my tracks.
Ugh - not another Madonna and Child!
This one is two bucks.
It's not that I question the artist's skill, but without the bullet holes, there's no passion.
I really do miss my mother.
My five year old could do these.
The artist seems to be in a rut.
It's very pedestrian.
You see...a long time ago, we needed protection...
I hate it when the artist plays it safe!
Yes, this was before we could drive and own humans as slaves.
Sure I've seen the copies. But the originals take my breath away.
Frankly, I've seen better on the side of the road.
Pietà on Rte. 17.
I had no idea they were warned.
Those headlights really capture our silhouettes perfectly.
There's something pessimistic about it...
He's more famous as a street artist
I know this is sexist, but I'd give my left antler for an ungulate like that.
It does kind of make you want to slow down, doesn't it?
Black really does take off ten pounds.
The headlights were bearing down on me, but I just stood there, like a... I don't know what.
So, back then, they had to use 4 legs to walk, eh.
I just can't get into street art.
That's funny. What do females know about routes?
Just another unrealistic body expectation.
Someone's going to pay big bucks for that one.
Definitely a pro-life statement disguised as a traffic hazard sign.
I was the model for this one.
It's the subtext that appeals to me. What are they crossing to?
It's okay but it needs a few bullet holes.
This baby on board thing has just gone too far.
I love the way it reflects the light.
Nice rump.
With self-driving cars, this artist has become obsolete.
And this one put you and your brother through college.
Finally! Two subjects, no antlers, and no prancing.
Maybe I'm a deer in the headlights, but I just don't see this as art.
I could have painted that.
I find his later work to be a bit cautious.
No, I clearly see them as a warning to modern society.
Before we took over, these were highway signs.
“You can almost see the light as it moves towards them. Bright and brilliant and... what was I saying?
I find this series rather pedestrian.
I feel like the artist has reached a crossroads.
That is definitely from his "Bambi" period.
Derivative.
You just can't top the classics.
Can you believe we share 98.8 percent of our DNA with them?
I was young and naive. I needed the money. You wouldn't understand.
Why are all the does shown in typically domestic roles?
It's a shame humans don't have these kinda warning signs for politicians.
Nudes yet again. Tasteless, if you ask me.
When I said, 'Show me a sign, dear,' this wasn't exactly what I had in mind.
His work still has impact.
I'm captivated by his use of headlights.
I see it's on loan from Highway 74.
Why are they using their arms to walk!
I preferred his moose series. They had more impact.
This masterpiece beautifully illustrates motherhood with a hint of impending danger.
It begs the question: “where are they going?”
Wholesome, innocent... a departure from his usual stag fare.
Yes, it's an offensive stereotype, but as a commentary on gender roles, it succeeds.
My theory is that the humans worshiped us as gods.
it doesn't capture the anxiety of the hedlights
I like it, but I prefer his "slippery when wet" period.
My five-month old fawn could have painted that.
I think the minimalism expresses a sense of imminent doom
I love his work in headlights.
Mommy Deerest.
Crossover art at its finest.
In Montana they shoot the signs too
I'd slow down for girls like that
Turns out he didn't really paint them,he just found them along the roadway.
Unlike Dad and Gramps, Mom really was a car stopper.
Remember when we used to think these signs meant they were onto us?
There's something about his work that just jumps out at you.
She never told me she was pregnant.
I love the symbolism
The artist's name is John Doe.
Now the Lascaux cave in France -- that's a museum!
The lighting in here is all wrong. The two lights, yes... but it seems like they should be coming from behind us.
I just don't see any sense of urgency here.
Yeah, Stan saw the symbolism – right before he saw the 18-wheeler.
The fact that these are on loan from the highway department is disturbing.
I never realized how photogenic we are.
It's just so...literal.
Ah. Verdeer's Madonna and Child.
This one definitely shows my best side.
I could have done without the headlights.
Is this really what humans think we do all day?
This is a shadow of his former work.
"Mother and child", his best work so far.
I'm still earning royalties for this one.
Pedestrian at best.
Rather pedestrian, I'd say.
He does silhouettes because it's so hard to hold the brush in his hoof.
I feel like it's a sign.
oh dear
What are we? Animals?!
These date back before we got the guns.
‘Mother with fawn.’ It’s an Interstate Highway System original.
What are your thoughts on gun control?
That two-legged hack can call it art all he wants. I call it cultural appropriation.
Wow, can you believe we used to live like this?
Not bad, but hardly worth a thousand bucks.
No, I get it. But is it art?
It's an image that truly encapsulates the existential angst of our times
Oscar Wilde may have coined the phrase "Life Imitates Art " But I bet he never had to dodge a 40 Ton Semi...
Human art is just so....generic.
For the last time: it doesn’t make you look fat.
I often wonder what it would be like if I had chosen the road less traveled.
Why do the women and kids get to walk on all fours?
If the art weren't bad enough, the headlights in the ceiling are downright offensive.
The artist claims that you need to be travelling at about 60 MPH to really get the gist.
Why, my dear, would you want to cross the road?
Son, These are just signs on the road to hell.
How about a sign that says, " Don't shoot us in the head while we're drinking water from a stream. "
I don't know...I just don't think street art has the same impact in the gallery.
I just don’t get it
Very nuanced, just a hint of oncoming headlight.
This one's so good I can see the ticks.
I guess the buck stops here.
I can't believe our ancestors used to walk on four legs. These primitive art drawings are a real window into our distant past.
There's no need to fawn over this one my deer.
Did our ancestors really used to walk on all fours like that?
Ralph might still be with us if these were hung outside.
If humans were so advanced, why were their drawings so primitive?
It’s the latest from Vincent van Doe
It's nice, but not as captivating as the headlight exhibit.
Black deers matter
You left out my antlers
Mind if we sit down? These hooves are killing me.
The picture itself doesn't really speak to me, but in these lights I just can't stop staring at it.
Ironically, this was the last one he painted before being hit by a truck.
I've seen his work all my life but I never considered it fine art.
Can you believe they used to let the humans drive?
This is far better than his duck series.
They're in Boca now, living off the residuals.
His yellow / diamond period was so attention grabbing
Every time you look closely at a classic, you find something new.
I think this would look really nice on our street.
Yes this one; it supports family values.
Amazing how progressive they were to depict a single-parent family
Couldn’t be mine..I don’t recognize the mom. What about you?
Notice the absence of bullet holes, forcing us to confront our complacency between predatory events.
It's great to see black actors in such multidimensional roles.
You know, we DO walk left to right occasionally.
This ancient art -- I just don't get. Did humans think all we did was cross roads?
I hate still life.
It's a meadowfor.
Here we see some of Rudolph's early modeling work, before the nose job.
If we pass this defensive walking course, our life insurance premiums will go down 10% for the next three years.
Profound use of silhouette by the artist.
It's one thing to read about, but to actually see them on all fours...that's really something.
Yes dear, that does look like Fawn when she was a baby.
The artist recently received a National Endowment for the Arts grant, and his work appears on highways nationally now.
Bambi Warhol
Your nudes are really coming along.
typical Typical the father is always left out of the picture
This is a step up from his Falling Rocks series.
That was painted after he cut off his tail.
Pre-children, Parenthood, Empty Nester!
Because fathers aren't considered important, that's why.
And yet we still don’t know why the deer crossed the road!
Are we supposed to imagine the absentee father just out gallivanting around?
Interesting fact, dear: In 2020, as the NRA expanded its sphere of influence, these signs were removed from roadways because they were considered to interfere with the inalienable right of driving a car.
To me, it's subversive: the flattened picture plane, the absence of landscape suggests a subtle, yet distinct, note of malice, of danger, in what is otherwise an ordinary scene of domestic tranquility. What do you think?
Although the artist is famous for his self-portraits, this rare work of his wife and young son is my favorite.
His work was a warning to us all
I prefer his earlier work.
Now, the dramatic rendering of this Madonna and Child is quite evocative.
Why are they crawling on all fours?
It's called portrait of the artist as a young buck
Evocative. I almost see headlights.
See, it is believed that our ancestors were four legged creatures.
Yes, Dear... those were taken of your Uncle Ned's family just before I-295 was completed.
Why do they paint us always in a yellow field? -where is the greenery ? Or the sky ?
The works are so popular. You see them almost everywhere.
It's so humbling to realize they thought of us as gods.
These works are pretty pedestrian.
The values skyrocket during hunting season.
Restored restroom signs from the pre-gender-neutral era.
It's quite a shift from the earlier 'Children at Play' era!
I've heard his work kills upstate.
This is art? Even my kid could do this—if she hadn't been hit by a car, that is.
His minimalist style sublimely emphasizes the grace and majesty his subjects had in life, which provides perfect counter-balance to the underlying theme of our own mortality. It is quite esoteric, really.
Sigh. Now the feminists have ruined another male tradition.
It's either the art or those lights, but I just can't look away.
It’s signage from when humans drove.
From his Headlights period.
No offence Buck, but this is the most boring stag party I've ever been to!
I'm sorry, but, I still think it's insulting to charge two bucks admission.
The fawn can stay for now because she was born here, but we're worried about the mother. She's Canadian.
Nice, but a little sentimental for my taste.
Well that's surprising... they call this exhibit "Deer in Headlights."
Life was simpler as a quadruped.
The use of offspring feels manipulative in this piece.
And here we have Madonna with Child.
At least this one isn't riddled with bullet holes...
If you say 'the buck stops here' one more time, I'm leaving.
Huh. You're right. He does look like me.
Whatever you do, don't look up.
If I may quote Homer....'Doe!'
I just don't buy that they're really in the headlights.
Shhhhh.... I’m reflecting.
Since you ask, Marvin, I find it rather shallow and pedantic.
This is the sign of our times: single doe with fawn and no buck in the picture.
But is it art though?
It's always single moms.
Things were so different before we learned to drive
We were at his opening on Route 8.
It says this one's on loan from the Taconic State Parkway.
This is crossing the line.
As if we're the problem...
A thousand bucks?
Your attention please. The Far Side museum will be closing in 15 minutes.
It lacks the gravitas of his earlier work.
I came here expecting a stag show - what are they thinking?
Apparently this one was just before the divorce.
“Actually I much prefer his earlier work with the bullet holes.
Mother and child, classic nude.
These unrealistic standards of beauty undermine healthy body image and self esteem.
As a painter, he hasn’t grown since his last show, “CATTLE XING”.
I took that one at Yellowstone last summer.
I posed for that right before I signed to do that Disney feature.
Look at this Harry, the gals and kids get a protected road crossing and we have to run for our lives.
I think this stuff belongs out on the street.
At least you can tell what this artist is driving at.
It's Warhol meets Lascaux.
It's so rare to find one without bullet holes.
Well this buck stops here.
Why is it ALWAYS the guys who get to leap?
Amazing, no bullet holes through any of these.
It's certainly more straightforward than his work with the chicken.
Share the road am I right?
It is nice to see that deer lives matter.
'Didn't Jane tell you she would be posing nude?'
I just can't look away.
At the height of their evolution, those extinct humans did really care about us.
Well, he's obviously not in it for the bucks.
These are all works by Vincent van Doe.
...and yet the color palette suggests looming danger.
I can't look away.
Ironically, the car had a baby on board sign.
Post-modernist irony, my antlers!
I don't care how provocative it is. I wouldn't want it in my living room!
I hear his works have quadrupled in value since he was run over crossing the highway.
It's clichéd, but it speaks to me.
It speaks to the impermanence of life.
A truck almost hit me while I was taking this picture.
Can someone dim the headlights?
The artist has exhaustively explored the Madonna-Child paradigm.
This one really jumps out at me.
Frankly, his yellow period is overrated.
These must be from Salvadeer Doeli's less famous I-95 period.
Outsider art at its worst.
Cute, but it lacks impact.
It isn't signed.
Yes, these early examples at communication among our ancient ancestors have been found in patterns across various landscapes, were they for navigation, or warning, we just do not know.
Inspiring- we should post caution signs with hunter silhouettes in our forest.
I know they're just spotlights, but I'm still stunned.
Yes but what does it MEAN....
This was part of a campaign to warn of unwanted pregnancies.
To be honest, this isn't the type of stag party I was expecting.
This is an old one of me and grandma back on highway 41.
I just don't get modern art.
The Madonna and Child don't appear often in his œvre.
The antlers in this one follow me no matter where I go.
Oh Bert, honestly! You think they're all one of yours.
I find it rather pedestrian.
These are on loan from the artist's Rural Route 2 collection.
Trite.
It's what they used to warn them about us before they and their cars became extinct.
It may seem like a crude illustration, son, but without works like these, most of us would just be roadkill.
Apparently it’s an implicit critique of the codification of a traditional family structure.
It's a nice departure from the Headlight series.
I still find them offensive
Just between us, I miss those days of chewing fresh grass on all fours.
This works for me on a purely sentimental level.
And to think they thought they'd outlast us.
We need car-crossing signs.
It's a little too "deer in the headlights" for my taste.
I wonder why non-deers always depict us in a yellow background.
Yes dear, you're much better looking.
I take umbrage with this one. Junior would never be in the lead.
I just don’t appreciate the Doedoe movement.
I wonder how Jackson Pollock would have painted us.
Apparently they date from some primitive civilization and had something to do with going places. No-one has yet figured it out.
I wouldn't pay two bucks for this.
The artist is a roads scholar.
So, why is modern art always hung crooked?
My inspiration? Matisse, Picasso, Chevrolet...
First road signs I have ever seen without red noses painted on us.
I see he's starting to deal with his parenting issues.
His previous work was less cautious.
The subtext is a negation of human necessity and dominance. I like it.
I’m just tired of everything being so political.
How do they know we are still illiterate?
See Bob, you were not the only child raised by a single mother. Get over it.
Your grandma and I were the first models.
Don't you love Madonna and Child?
This one seems rather pedestrian.
A single mother coping with the stark realities of a post-industrial world, that's what I see.
I prefer stag pictures.
Damn things don’t work.
Dude. Bambi's mom is such a M.I.L.F.
The artist was a dear deer friend
I think it would better for all of us if they put these back where they found them.
Ah yes, another work by Jane Doe.
What a sell-out! Next thing you know, he'll be doing Christmas sweaters.
'We need better car control laws- not more signs!"
Dang. This one has bullet holes too.
This makes me cross.
I see deer, cars and artist in rut.
Confidentially, in private that’s how I walk.
An unsettling ominous feeling characterizes his art, won't you say?
It lacks impact.
The technique is fine, but I just find the whole concept a bit deerivative.
Listen, I appreciate it. But does it work?
This one jumps out at me.
I don't know if it's art, but I know what I like
And to think, we never received any usage royalties for any of these images!
I wouldn't have let MY daughter pose for that.
I much preferred the earlier works from the "Deer Xing" Period.
So predictable. He's in a rut
Yes, parenthood definitely slows you down!
Buck, here is one of you and mom.
His art is so... pedestrian.
This piece would look fabulous along Route 97
It's all so patriarchal, stereotypical and derivative of the great " Deer X..ing " !
Doesn't Look like Rudolph's work.
Now, I don't claim to be an art expert, but to me it just seems to lack depth.
It's taking every ounce of my willpower to focus on this tripe instead of just staring at those headlights in the ceiling.
This one goes for less then a buck.
Humans protect us against cars but then… they shoot us. Go figure.
I realize now that we are the art.
His imagery is too repetitive, but I love the tipped square format.
If only art could solve problems instead of just increasing awareness.
Too pastoral. I like the street buck with bullet holes.
Her Abstract Alarmist stuff is a bit too realist for me.
Sign or Symbol?
Objectified, as usual.
Wait, they actually made signs for us?
Few who have seen these in the wild lived to tell about it.
It's a middle-of-the-road exhibit.
Surprisingly, the works lack urgency.
It does seem to capture a certain je ne sais quoi.
Personally, I'm a fan of his earlier crossings.
This was the last image she posed for before the accident.
Another sad example of cultural appropriation
I think this one's a warning about unprotected sex.
I think painting Bambi and his mother is a bit tasteless, given what happened....
It's called "Madonna and Child."
I like the way it evokes family values.
The headlights on the ceiling is a crude joke.
I was outbid by 2 bucks
She finally got out of the rut.
Ugh, it's completely deerivative.
The black against yellow contrast creates an interesting figure-ground reversal but I wouldn't stop for it.
One picture is worth a thousand bucks.
Good roadside stuff, but not even close to Cave Art!
This one's only a buck.
Lichtenstein's early period.
Maybe it's me, but I just don't see what this artist is driving at.
The mother with child theme is so passé.
There are two things I stand for: art and gun control.
You know what it says to me? It says, 'Deer!'
Not bad, but where are the headlights?
"Oh deer, the four legged silhouette on yellow grows tiresome".
I know her, and she is not what I call wildlife.
The nudity seems gratuitous.
Joe, I know they always have twins, but it’s artistic license.
I can't believe how primitive we used to be.
Quadrupedalism? Man, that must've sucked.
So how long do you think Tillerson's gonna last?
Kinda sexist to always show the MOM with the fawn
Makes me wonder if I should have started a family instead of going stag.
I hate to sound like a philistine, but my fawn could've painted this.
Pretentious, but somehow compelling
Hence the phrase "life imitates art"
For you, it's art. For me, it's a warning.
It's from the Van Doe Collection.
This just doesn't have the same impact.
This is from his early Bambi period.
I've bought one to hang by the edge of the woods; it'll get the neighbor's attention.
They call this art? I've seen better road signs!
She started posing for nudes when I fell behind on child support.
I bet this one is worth a buck or two.
Hooves are always so hard to paint.
I just love these Rural Primitives, so evocative of an earlier time.
Ah, the Doe-na Lisa.
I certainly hope these are not originals.
Well, it certainly makes you pause and think.
Indeed, a collision of cubism and post-modern simplicity.
"The artists overhead head-light effect is mesmerizing"!
His work immortalizes the tragedies suffered by our ancestors.
Just love these cave paintings.
I always preferred the road less traveled.
Let me guess, we used to stand on 4 legs AND shit in the woods.
This is gonna bring in the big bucks.
Thematically, it breaks the glass ceiling. Soft lines. Nurturing composition. A generational leap in art. I hate it.
Just once, I would like to feel welcoming rather than warning.
This really makes me pause.
Quintessential Elk Greco.
I dunno Hubie, I'm not a big fan of street art.
This one doesn't leap out at me.
His work is displayed throughout the country, but the artist remains surprisingly anonymous.
This guy is great. Soon this stuff will be on every street corner.
I'm not sure I get what such primitive folk art is trying to say.
Fawning.
Really?! It's 2017. I take the kids to school, too, you know.
Like anyone pays attention to signs.
Quit fawning, you know she's not real.
It's abstract, you wouldn't get it
Grandpa loved this one. Too bad he couldn't look away.
Bold...yet cautionary...
How pedestrian!
I remember them posing for it just before they were run over.
I don't know, it's just so pedestrian.
I'll never understand why everyone fawns over modern art.
A bit pedestrian.
Shouldn't they be running?
I mean, come on, where are the bullet holes?
It says the artist died soon after this was taken."
I don't know, it seems a little derivative to me.
Man, that reminds me..next week is rutting season!
. . . sort of ironic that the artist's works are unfinished due to that hit-and-run.
I hear DOT bought the whole series.
She seems almost caught between worlds -- half looking back to the yellow warmth and safety of Mom, and half looking forward the great unknown beyond known boundaries. Genius.
I imagine that with automated braking systems, these will become obsolete
They don't grab me like her headlight series.
Well, frankly I'm not sure what the artist is trying to tell us here.
So, none of these photographers are NRA members. right?
A bit pedestrian if you ask me.
When the light hits it they seem so still.
I prefer his earlier work with Disney.
The flattened forms and monochromatic color structure help to bring out the artist's themes of foreboding.
Why do critics fawn over this? My little kid could do better.
Yes, look at that detail, they appear to almost jump off the canvas...
It's sentimental, and yet somehow I still like it.
It's quite typical of pre-2050 highway art
Did I tell you I was a traffic sign model once?
I miss them so much...
And here, his later semi-domesticated period.
Our plan succeeded, they yielded & the rest is history...
Classic example of mid-century Protectionist self-perpetuating gender stereotyping.
"Very one dimensional----disappointingly stereotypical".
Very evocative of Disney's "Bambi: The Early Years".
I can't decide if it's appropriate or ironic that the exhibit is sponsored by Cabela's.
So *that’s* what we used to look like in the headlights.
I never understood asphalt expressionism.
The composition is good, but I can't say I care for his color choices.
The artist is a deer friend.
Yeah, it could be all that highbrow, poser fine arts degree crap you just made up, or it could just be two deer.
Found art? More like stolen from mile marker 37 on the Taconic.
Didn't make a damn bit of difference, did it?
We should have paid extra for the audio tour.
Sorry......I can’t read sign language.
I think it's a hackneyed take-off of the 'Baby On Board' fad!
Maybe it's the lighting, but I just can't look away.
This was right after his Blue Period.
Yes, I remember this one from the contraception campaign.
But what does it all mean?
I just don't understand how they get the colors so wrong.
Hmmmm. A silhouette of mother and child in a limited black and yellow palette. Art, or road sign?
Notice how her eye follows you wherever you stand.
Despite the minimalistic style I find the sense of impending doom is prodigiously palpable.
A fine example of the New Jersey school.
I still prefer her early work with ducks
What do you think the artist is trying to say?
"Well I don't care how famous the artist is. I don't like nude paintings.
It's so pedestrian.
Doh! It's a deer. A female deer. My bad.
If you have to read the caption then you don't get it.
I find it pedestrian.
Why not just put them on a milk carton?
I find his work to be rather pedestrian.
At least they're not wearing bells and holly and pulling a sleigh.
I find it too pedestrian.
"All deer are equal, but some are more--" hey wait a second, is that Janice!?
I have to say, I just don't get it.
Look at these cave-deer, still on all-fours. We've come a long way.
...think these warning signs might have worked a little too well?
The "Madonna and Fawn" has always been my favorite!
I find his work too cautious.
Hey Ken, that's a great shot of Joanne and the kid!
Post-modernism has killed the art of portraiture.
I thought he was gay.
These are from his road crossing period.
I agree, it's pretty impenetrable work, but maybe it's a warning about being too complacent, that death is a real possibility, and ultimately we are all deer just caught in the headlights?
I've seen reproductions just down the road.
She looks a lot like my ex.
Just adore his "Bambi Period".
This says it's on loan from the Poughkeepsie road commission.
I'd say it was a haunting and iconic piece, but that's so clichè!
My yearling could do that.
The good old days, when crossing the street was our only form of stress.
This is just what I need for my den.
The images are compelling, but ultimately the composition fails; they both ended up in the grill of Ford F150.
Supposedly these were 'warning signs' for the now extinct 'human race'. Wouldn't be the first ones they ignored!
He's stuck in his yellow period.
Impressive talent, the signs were there.
I remember those wild stag days...but then we had Rudolph.
Striking, but nothing to fawn over.
This looks nothing like us. No wonder they keep hitting us with their cars.
The allusions to cinematic stereotypes make his work so dark.
You say it's art imitating wildlife. I say it's wildlife imitating art.
It has a definite "deer in the headlights" feel to it
Really? I only see headlights.
He was much more creative before he started working for the Department of Highways,
I love the juxtaposition between doe and fawn.
I find the piece to be a bit pedestrian.
Humans really love this art. They usually slow their cars when they see one.
They won't cross with all the heteronormative nuclear family construction.
I told her that's not my good side.
What the hell is this supposed to be?
It plays a little too much to the emotions.
Seems derivative.
What tasteful nudes.
how do we cross in the other direction?
I love Thomas Kincade's early work.
Here we have ancient human artifacts depicting a time they worshipped our quadruped ancestors.
This one set off a second-wave feminist critique of the male gaze.
All the warning signs were there, but I got involved with her anyway.
All the critics are fawning over this young buck, but I'm pretty sure he's just in it for the doe.
Am I just too stupid to get it?
Are these used for target practice by the gun lobby?
It's like I'm transported there, you know?
We need signs with pictures of cars on them.
I could never understand modern art.
Her "Madonna and Child" series is a nod to neo-naturalism.
George, does this drawing make my butt look big?
They were used on many roads before the self-driving car era.
Yes...but what does it MEAN????
She never mentions being a model when we talk.
It's good, but would I cross the road just to look at it?
Female artist, of course.
All I can remember were the headlights.
They always use our bad side.
This is from her Pre-Feminist period.
It's a cautionary tale.
I don't get it.
I never knew that they came like this without bullet-holes in them.
They're more likely to stop with this one.
Ever wonder who the models were and where they are now?
I can't keep my eyes off of it. It's brilliant, like car headlights.
I think it captures her vulnerability perfectly, don't you?
I don't know, darling, the way he's used the light makes it hard to look away.
Turns out we're part of the deer diaspora.
And here we have the revered 'Mother and Child'. Acrylic on aluminium plate, pre-1983 style. Modern versions have a non-gender specific adult and child, so this is quite a treat, Fred.
Don't you just get tired of seeing pictures of people's kids?
Tell me the truth, do I look fat?
Listen, I get that we look more sophisticated now, but ever since we started standing like this my back has been killing me
Ceci nes't pas un cerf.
I wish they'd put these back on the road.
Beautifully captures the pathos of single motherhood. Damn hunters.
It looks nothing like her.
It's not as captivating as his headlight paintings.
Snap out of it Venny. You've got that 'deer in the headlights' look again.
Ah yes, and here we have the artist's renowned Yellow Period.
Critics acclaim this piece to be Bambi's best work during his introspection period.
For some reason I'm entranced by this Minimalist expression of life's fragility.
I preferred his Bambi Phase.
Deers Under Headlights.
Frankly, I think his color range is a bit limited.
You ever wonder if maybe the NRA put these signs up?
Enough with the reminiscing. I still think bipedalism rules!
They crossed to get to the other side
How do we know they're not copies?
Now here's a feminine perspective.
"When they did worse than cavemen, that's when we knew it was over".
I call this one, "Deer in the headlights"
Fat lot of good that did mom and sis.
Yeah, I'd hit that.
Seems to be entirely without context, I prefer the roadside installations.
I find the disjunctive use of yellow space in this one reductive and vaguely appalling.
His work is pedestrian.
It's titled "Before The Buick".
Everything is derivative, Margaret.
And that's how I met your mother.
There's no WAY she lost her baby weight that fast!
So where am I supposed to cross?
Doe .... a deer, a fe..male deer. Ray.... I had too much to drink.
But what if I want to cross the street from left to right?
Madonna and Child is my favorite
Dad was a selfish bastard who wanted to be on his own sign
The picture does not make you look fat.
Can you believe the artist is just some Jane Doe?
Only humans push their children into the street first.
I'm just tired of the 'stag out leaping while doe watches fawn' cliché
The yellow and black palette, the off-kilter orientation, suggest such a sense of cautious watchfulness. You literally want to slow down and just look.
He found artistic inspiration during a roadblock in his life.
Representational, yes. But what does it mean?
She got custody, but I didn't expect her to flaunt it on social media.
I'll take door number 3.
Is it just me, or does this picture make you really horny?
I liked his jumping period.
The art of the deer.
It's a shame that Bambi's mother couldn't be here to see his art.
This only hints at the impact of his work.
Till now, I haven't seen any without bullet holes in it.
Our fawn-sitter cancelled at the last minute and Bambi Jr. Kept wandering into the shot so the artist just went with it.
I have this one on my mud flaps.
The artist's Yellow Period has its roots in his personal trauma after being caught in the headlights.
So is this one of those "art imitates life" kinda things, or more a Warholian Campbell's Soup sorta deal?
The natural environment always seemed to elude this artist.
...but joint custody just seemed so damned obvious..
You look fine.. They say street signs add 10 pounds..
Abstract, yes. And yet, so real.
Why do they always make us cross the road at the busiest intersections?
The artist seems to be in a rut.
I miss Bambi. God bless her soul.
Pristine. Not a single bullet hole.
So lifelike.
It's a van Doe
All his best work is plein air.
I don't know. It seems to suggest walking across the highway when we really should be jumping.
But what if I don't identify as a buck OR doe?
I hear the artist cut off one of his antlers.
Her new work feels very cautionary.
It is creative, but is it art?
Why do they always paint us black?
This is not a deer.
Even from this angle, it looks like a trap.
If they had one signifying "dead deer dragged to the side of the road," I would find the whole exhibit to be culturally more authentic.
The buck is classic art, obviously, but feminists pressured this museum for a representation of a doe and fawn.
I like the simplicity of his yellow period.
I prefer her blue period
I mean, it's nice that they're honouring our kind, but did they have to call it the Road Kill Exhibit?
Sorry I'm late. It was hard to find a safe place to cross the street.
It's all so deerivative.
It's incredible that this artist is anonymous.
My fawn could paint better than that.
Well, he's no Van Doe.
The child support is killing me.
It's found art.
They say this is the last thing you see before you die.
This yellow symbolizes bright, captivating lights.
The artist is a master in the use of headlights.
The fact the artist is a deer doesn't make it inoffensive.
I think he caught the essence of our vulnerability, don't you?
Doe: A Deer.
Lighting is so important.
I've always liked the Primitives.
Banal, yes, but I see it as commentary on our visceral, nay primal, impulses.
Sentimentality. A serious flaw. Wyeth has it too.
Mom regrets that shoot.
But what is the artist saying about gender roles?
Superb use of reflection.
His work is always so traffic-stopping.
Personally, I find it exploitive.
Is that really how I look from the side?
I love how the antlers seem to follow you around the room.
The artist discovered that patrons finally spent sufficient time appreciating her work when she switched the overhead lighting to high beams.
I actually preferred his feminist period.
I love the theatricality of retroreflecting.
These are from my 'At a Crossroads' series.
Art imitating deer.
I see the resemblance.
Such rudimentary depictions, no wonder humans became extinct.
I don't know...I think this one lacks energy.
They call this series, "Deer in the Headlights."
While I agree with you that the mother/child relationship as artistic subject has become woefully trivialized, I find this particular rendering a moving example nonetheless.
I just don’t think it says enough.
I get that it's just a sign of a sign of our time..I still want to know if they made it or not.
Donald Trump is a jackass.
I really see myself in this one. Me too, it's like it's a sign or something.
Although I appreciate the focus on motherhood here, I still believe his masterpiece caution-sign is The Buck Stops Here.
Is this what women want?
Kinda brings new meaning to the phrase ‘the buck stops here’, eh?
It might be OK for driverless cars.
I look fat.
This is from his "public service" series.
This one hits a little too close to home...
We should have seen the warning signs earlier.
I'm delighted that the curator brought back his Yellow Period.
It was a dark and stormy night.
I prefer his earlier 'Headlights' series.
"Criticize it all you want, but the Highway Department Collection does depict the existential crisis facing us all.
Man, I would be waiting at the other side of that crossing if I knew where it was.
She left me for the artist shortly after posing for this.
The element of caution in the work somehow comforts me.
It seems more a cautionary tale than a masterpiece.
Rather pedestrian, don’t you think?
This one looks like a Roadin.
I agree it's breathtaking but frankly I just don't get it.
I really like these primitives. And, yes, I found a good parking spot.
I heard the artist died in the making of this piece.
I used to be married to his model.
She should never have posed nude.
It's a sign!
None of them speak to me.
And then in November, in a vertiginous about face, they remember killing us is really a fun pastime.
Are we always reduced to stereotypes?
This artist's ability to capture us so vividly in abstract two-color form is reminiscent of Warhol.
...and then she ran off with the artist.
It's so educational, yet existential.
Heyyyy, I think I know that guy.
Must be rutting season. This artist is in one.
They're not sure if this was an early form of currency, or perhaps light erotica.
I've always loved Vincent van Doe
Have you found the recurring theme?
All the signs showed that it was only a matter of time before we learned to walk upright.
My two year-old fawn could have painted that.
So compelling...yet, so yielding.
This one really speaks to me.
It lacks the energy of the other signs, although it plays to the heartstrings!
What I see, is really just a cautionary tale.
When humans reigned, they saw us as obstacles.
No, these came after his Moose Period.
It's from his crossover period.
I can safely say we've seen it all before
It is not street art, it is road art
THEY SHOULDN'T BRING FAMILY PHOTOS IN HERE...
Sorry.... I prefer artists who are a little more abstract.
They say it speaks to the harsh intersection of man and nature, but all I see is a bunch of black splotches.
So, they let them walk, and we have to leap?
Gender stereotypes know no bounds.
"So this is how they see us.....".
These Ancestry exhibits are as boring as hell.
So what is the take-home message?
This one really put us on the map.
Sadly, if they don't learn to run and jump I see jerky and gloves in their future.
I didn't come here to get preached to.
How odd, it's so pedestrian, and yet it has a distinct aura of danger.
Next time, I'll take a selfie.
Hmph! Minimalism meets paleo-art.
Pornography or Art?
This is from his "In a Rut" period.
This one is from his roadkill period.
Personally, I prefer non-representational art
These are from his "Headlight Period".
The Lascaux series really captured us better.
It has the feel of a "Far Side" cartoon
Frankly, John, none of them speak to me.
I find the artist's use of stop signs to be more effective.
The painting is only good because the artist cut his own antler off.
I hate these signs telling us where we can cross a road.
The doe-and-fawn theme combined with the graphically intended aesthetic screams Cassatt.
Before internet porn...this was all we had.
It's part of his 'Buck Lives Matter' series.
I've seen these somewhere before.
But why in the world would anyone be afraid of us? That's just crazy!
Frankly, I resent the gender stereotyping.
It's too industrial chic for my taste.
Too abstract -- I'm not seeing it.
I'm afraid you and I are going to butt heads over this one.
Notice how the eyes follow you...
Again with the nudes.
His art is so... pedestrian.
Mother and child...probably the most touching image in the entire DOT series.
I don't know. It needs context.
His work is good, except he perpetuates gender-role stereotypes.
I don't know much about art, but I know what I like.
The artist's use of headlight is exquisite.
The form says "threat." The content is one-dimensional and repetitious. The Bambi reference is tacky.
School Crossing
VERY NICE, NOW WE NEED TO WORK ON GUN CONTROL
This would look nice in the den but it costs too much doe.
He was quite innovative; usually the Madonna is holding the Child.
Still amazed they haven't figured out that we're attracted by these signs.
I told you we should have rented the audio guide.
And I paid a buck for this.
Do you really think he looks like me?
I'd give my right antler for her!
For this painting, I've used the high beam headlights.
Yes, that is my wife Jane Doe and my new fawn Bambi.
Let me guess: Bambi and her mom?
Ironically, he died by Chevy Malibu.
It's so pastoral and yet devil may care.
I remember when they took that picture ...They used a flash and we were like us in the headlights.
Such an amazing use of color.
This was his Bambi period.
This reminds me that I'm a month behind in calf support.
They’re all fakes. Real signs have bullet holes.
These are quaint. I remember when deer walked on all fours and humans thought they ruled the earth.
I'm not sure if the artist is trying to put forth the angst of his youth or if he is just caught in the headlights of the inner turmoil that comes with preparing to make that leap across the highway of life
He’s right—no matter what we put up, they still won’t slow down.
Really makes you think...where is the exit sign?
I miss the days before selfies.
It lacks movement, as if headlights have frozen them in place.
The antlers command the big bucks. We could buy this one and save some real dough.
I named this one "Omage to Mom".
Finally after being dead for 40,000 years Grog's Cave Art is appreciated.
Sentimental, perhaps, yet revealing a universal truth of the eternal bond.
The ceiling headlamps are a nice touch.
I don't understand the yellow.
This is so pedestrian.
This lighting in this exhibit is so good, I can't look away
She's been unbearable ever since she posed for this.
I think parenthood suits her. . .the last time I saw her she was dancing on a pole and the bucks were all over her!
It's very "Antler Warhol".
Fat? Well, uh, you did just have a baby.
It seems a bit derivative to me.
Nice museum, but why must they place the restrooms in the woods?
Crude, yet quite expressive!
And yet another unrealistic standard...
I'd say he was either colorblind or in his "yellow/black phase".
To be perfectly honest, I liked his blue period better.
kinder...gentler...signage...
Oh dear. Isn't that your sister
Why don't they acknowledge our childcare efforts ? You think all we do is leap about ?
I understand the artist died early due to a '98 Camaro.
Although I am not a painter, I think that the mechanical mark-making of the biomorphic forms verges on codifying the substructure of critical thinking.
I assume that these pictures have a purpose.
I prefer 'The Buck Stop's Here.'
Fine.......I concede that the artist is both cautious and unimaginative!
If she were walking a human baby we could get people to slow down and also say 'what the hell?'
His work is not well known in the city.
I just don't get it-is this telling me to run across the highway, or just keep grazing?
That's what I call Street Art!
Charlie, the buck stops here.
Its a bit derivative if you ask me.
Why do they always stereotype us!
It looks like something my fawn could do.
I saw this composition on my cross country road trip
I have antlers. Where are the antlers?
Ah, it's a bit deerivative really, don't you think?
The catalog said: 'unknown artist from the automobile era'.
Can self-driving cars...oh never mind.
The fossil record must be right. We did walk on four legs at one point.
I hear he made a killing in commercial art.
Few touch traumatic subjects as elegantly.
They call this art?
Well, if human beings had art, they would probably represent themselves, too.
My tastes run more to the Impressionists
Frivolous, boorish, fawning.
I was young and they offered a few bucks.
You can almost visualize the head lights.
Exquisite draftsmanship. I don't suppose we'll ever be able to understand how they were intended to be used.
Patriarchy or third-wave feminism?
This one is a crowd pleaser at the National Parks.
I've always liked his Yellow Period best.
I said I'd never let my wife pose for a nude, and here we are.
Son of a buck, I don't get it.
Simple and seemingly unambiguous, yes. But I also sense something premonitory, even potentially transgressive.
This one really captures the essence of slowing down.
These really make you stop and look...
Looking at these, I need one for the road.
Nice likeness of junior. You, not so much.
I agree. The cave paintings in Lascaux are more 'hauntingly beautiful.'
Overtly feminist if you ask me!
This strikes me as feminism, doe.
Why don't they ever show us crossing on two legs?
Boy, that's a real DILF!
Art eventually always cycles back to what really matters.
It's called pre-impressionism
This was a rare find, not one bullet hole.
I liked his Blue Period better.
This gallery is in a rut.
His Madonna and Child is among his finest work.
I never bring my kids here, due to the nudity.
It's a little two dimensional.
Damn! I forgot to mail the alimony check.
So, I guess there's no worries about hitting males with their cars cuz they can always just shoot us.
They're rather one-dimensional.
Did I tell you I was his muse?
Just another stereotype!
I think it's reductive.
The artist's overdependence on silhouettes makes me want to cross a busy highway.
is this how savage we were that they had to have signs to warn the animals about us?
It's really hard to imagine such an uncivilized time period.
The work has a certain urgency to it.
The gratuitous nudity is a bit much.
And this was your great-great grandmother with your great uncle, who both, unfortunately, did not survive the Great Deer Crossing of ‘32.
hey that is my brother
I prefer his earlier, white period--more reflective.
I can't take my eyes of off this. It's like I'm stuck in these flood lamps.
His use of color is cautionary.
Extraordinary use of the female form. It invokes the Circle of Life theme in a pre-roadkill context.
That ones worth a lot of doe!
Maybe we need better "headlight crossing" signs.
Mother with child.
I've heard the café here does a great carrot cake...
Amazing how he catches the essence of family...
As much as my work vilifies him, in some ways Henry Ford is my muse.
Doe,a deer,a female deer.
I'm no art critic, but give me a Leaping Stag any day
His art is a bit too safe for my taste.
This piece makes me feel cross.
Too sentimental.
"I prefer these "early crossings" to the "late crossings" period.
swipe left
I resent being objectified.
It’s a very good likeness.
It symbolizes that objects in mirror are closer than they appear
How could anyone title this cute pair "Danger"?
I just don't get feminist art.
Sometimes I wish we’d had kids
This deer in the limelight gallery is a little derivative
Too busy.
Doe,a deer,a female deer.
How long have you been figure modeling?
As Grammy would've said, if they're not flyin', they're dyin'.
I still think it makes me look fat.
Before she was a model I used to go out with her.
"Very safe... I prefer 'edgy'
Eyes must be hard to draw
How did my Christmas card get here?
When life was simple...
Bambi: A Retrospective.
This is a bad sign!
He really captures something essential about the highway-crossing experience.
What's the point?
The artist died in a car crash
It looks EXACTLY like the one outside my thicket
The exhibit is called "The Buck Stops Here" but I think it is just deer in headlights.
What a difference viewing these in OVERhead lights.
I never know what to make of these.
It may be a sign of the times, but I’m not going to fawn over it.
Madoena with child
This truly encapsulates our deepest nightmares.
It is truly remarkable how he captured the en plein air scene in situ.
No, I think she's just standing closer to the artist.
I don't know...this one just doesn't leap out at me.
It must be hard being a single mother with the whole world watching your every move
"Deer in headlights" -- now, with self-driving cars, the only place these signs belong is in a museum.
Well Horace- I think it’s a sign we should approach this work with caution
Antler neutral art is pointless.
I NEVER COULD FIGURE OUT HIS BACKGROUND COLOR AND CANVAS SHAPE .
Humans may be murderous hunters, but you gotta admire their stencil work.
I know it's been done before, but Madonna and Child is timeless.
I preferred his Blue period.
It's part of our gender outreach project.
Ah . . . when our greatest worries were a few cars . . . those were the days!
Of course I love the subject matter but the work is so derivative.
I've seen it...
Does this one make you feel horny?
Well nobody ever complained to Van Gogh that he used too much yellow.
It certainly captures the pathos of the homeless mother and child living on the fringes of society.
It speaks with a certain sense of dread, true ... but is it art?
To me, they lack the urgency and emotional heft of her moose and tractor pieces.
All's I'm saying is that, yes, it's good. But it's not stop-you-in-your-tracks good.
I've always thought he was derivative.
Van Doe’s early work was so derivative.
Blatantly sexist, if you ask me.
These are all on loan from the NRA
Sorry, I just could not resist the temptation to say "it's endearing"
I don't know...to me, Yield is Yield, but the kid has a good walk.
I think I've decided: life imitates art.
I like this more recent work. She's really crossed over.
For some reason, I’m filled with the urge to stand completely still.
The artist really captured that 'deer in the headlights' expression.
Perhaps this is alarmist, but I still like the use of color.
She looks very much like my ex-wife.
I think your premium goes down if you have one of these in your neighborhood.
I can't help fawning over this one.
He's finally ready to take the show on the road.
You know Fred, if we had THIS sign on Stone Road, Bettie would still be with us.
They never seem to get the screams right.
He's caught the essence but it so lacks nuance or depth.
Nice mix of Warhol and Lascaux.
How come they never show us standing up?
I've seen Lascaux's work and believe me, this is no Lascaux!
Did you know humans were color-blind?
Subscribers to Deerwinism believe we used to walk on all four.
Endearing, aren't they?
His career is at a crossing point.
this campaign was very successful until drivers figured out we don't really follow these signs
I love the use of foreshadowing.
I understand the artist has a preference for rural roadside displays.
Frankly, I've always found his yellow period overly cautious.
Grotesque…Token Gesture…Antlerless…Crass reparation for Bambi Syndrome…I think I like it.
I preferred the previous exhibit "STOP" and its related works.
It's titled "The Buck Stops Here."
I don't know anything about road signs, but I know what I like.
This was the pinnacle of his DoT period.
We didn't just cross the road
They're serving chardonnay and a salt lick at the reception.
This tells me something about myself.
It sure doesn't look like me.
Miss Route 66 is so hot!
No, actually, the artist isn't anonymous -- "Jane Doe" is the title.
My mother pushed me into modelling at an early age.
If you ask me, he's only interested in making a fast buck.
But still, why we are crossing?
Im frozen to this spot....it may be the over headlights
I met the model.
"I know what I like, but whenever I see these on the road I run like hell"!
The artist is telling us to ask ourselves, why did we cross the road?
Of course nudes represent the highest form of art.
Does this one make you feel a little horny?
I call this "Doe and Fawn in the Headlights"
Before self-driving cars, these were very important.
They lack depth!
This is an example of the Yellowstone Pluralistic Period.
Oh deer god.
the signs are everywhere
They died so that we may cross the road.
We can see this stuff at home.
It's too derivative. I prefer the Rothkos.
Pedestrian
I usually can't stand such overt appeals to the sentimental but...wow.
overall, an unsatisfactory interpretation of our culture.
I'm starting to sense a theme
Men are always just a target. Why can't we be shown with our children?
My cousin saw this piece during its outdoor gallery tour through Maine. May he rest in peace...
I'm not sure but, I think the buck behind me is gay, not that there's anything wrong with that.
As a stay-at-home stag I find it sexist.
So that's the way our ancestors looked when they used all fours.
I see headlights.
This one isn't hitting me like the other two.
It's about doom.
Beautiful example of Late Informational .
Airport art is so mundane.
I think it marginalizes the role of the doe in society.
I would bet two bucks to one this one brings the doe.
We saw this last summer at the Venison Biennale.
And the ceiling lamps symbolize headlights...
Good efforts, but what's really needed is real headlight legislation.
I would have liked a trigger warning.
To me this screams gender limiting in the role of child rearing...she is fine though.
I still say this Bambsi guy is a fraud.
Are the bullet holes authentic, or ironic?
I love stag pictures.
I think the artist is in a rut.
I don't recall signing a release form.
These are boring, let’s check out the horses.
This one resulted in the end of her visionary Deer in the Headlights period.
He's really played it safe since the incident.
Humans were bad artists.
Clearly, art imitating life . . .
Back then, it was impossible to find 4 shoes that fit.
Prices for these skyrocketed after his death
Amazing! We've come a long way; it must be hard to roam on 4 legs.
I like this one with the mother and child with their gaze frozen in the headlights.
...but eventually we decided it was either us or the cars
Symbols of male identity are eroding in this country.
It's clearly a commentary on gender stereotypes.
Too sentimental.
Hey, what's your sign?
So simple. Doesn't even need a caption.
They could've at least gotten me from my good side.
I don't really care for the juxtaposition of diagonal and horizontal.
This collection must predate our bipedal evolution. I wonder if they were talking yet.
Of course this before the Lyme disease pandemic.
It's always Madonna and child! What about us stags?
How much do you think they were paid to pose like that?
My friend Fred was looking at that masterpiece on the side of the road, but now I haven't seen him since
it says here, that he got his inspiration while driving
Im tired of the "single doe & fawn" depiction and we're always the ones leaping away.
It's Surrealism, alright. Why cross the street when you can get it delivered next day for free?
While I admire the sentiment, I find it derivative
Ah, a masterwork of the Xing dynasty.
This DOT guy was really good.
The lighting is what make this mesmerizing.
See? I told you what can happen!
SENIOR BUCK: "YES..AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF AN EDGAR DEERGAS!" YOUNG BUCK: "ARE YOU KIDDING? THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A VINCENT VAN DOE!"
Our ancient cave paintings of them were better.
I find this very pedestrian.
Haven't we seen this before?
The paintings here are a buck a dozen, but I bet this one is a lot of doe!
I prefer his earlier work to this transitional, cross-over period.
Ah, yes... the primitive symbols of our ancestor's presence.
Brilliant! They're simple, yet they elicit a visceral sense of danger!
Here's the one! My cousin's wife and fawn were the models for this one - she died shortly after this. Sad story but they made it into a movie so the kid got rich.
But now how will we know where to cross the road?
I get it. So us guys are on our own.
Of course the father is left out of this one.
She'll be impossible after this.
So is it deers or deer?
It's nice to see that his gig at Department of Transportation wasn't a dead end.
So deerivative.
'I know this family and they should stay off the road'
Another single mother...
I believe that the lack of a strong father figure in this particular sub genre of portraits leads ineluctably to the high observed mortality rates in asphalted grazing areas.
It's nice, but I prefer the more exuberant quality of the others.
Do they use Photoshop?
Tragically he ignored the message of his art.
Yes, humans seem to love this sort of deer art; just look along their roads!.
I'm sure it will bring a few bucks.
The artist's use of light is mesmerizing.
I can definitely see the antecedents in the Paleolithic cave paintings. But is it really art?
I’m not sure what I’m looking at, but I like it.
The artist was at crossroads.
That's right Buck, your grandma was a famous model , she studied fashion and "de sign"!
My yearling could do that.
Deer crossing signs give us a false sense of security.
His early road-signs just didn't capture the essence of the pending collision.
I don't know about you Fred, but this one makes me want to pull over.
His work really took off after he was nailed by that semi.
Why is it always you and Junior?
I think these headlights over head are in bad taste.
Illuminating them with headlights was crafty.
Ah yes, another liberal artist working their agenda.
But don't you think it makes my butt look big?
That look? Well, I used car headlights.
It's nice, but where are the trees?
The car headlights illuminating the art were a nice touch.
Perhaps you've seen my work on the side of the road.
Rather Rubenesque, don’t you think?
The "deer in the overhead lights" motif displays a subtle irony that I find appealing.
I looked so young and fit then.
This is the portrait of my wife and kid that was previously exhibited at mile marker 24.
It reminds me of my first wife,
I think the nudity highlights their vulnerability.
ADMISSION: Three Bucks.
This one is called "Madonna With Blitzer."
This "kids go first" crap goes against the grain.
I like this one. It makes us seem more vulnerable.
No antlers. That's minimalism gone too far.
The "art" happens when a car hits a deer. Seriously though– is it privileged to say I regret my MFA?
Too soon.
The proceeds go to a memorial fund for the artist's mother.
I love it. I can almost hear the highway traffic.
I thought his "Steep Grade" work was more inspired.
Pedestrian, yes. But at least it’s not another ‘Keep your feet on the ground, but keep reaching for the stars.
I prefer to see them mounted on a wall like this, don't you?
I don't know art but this seems rather two-dimensional and anthropocentric to me.
This one hung in my room at Dartmouth.
That whole thing about us and headlights is fake news.
He really captures that "caught in the headlights" expression.
It's so nice to see our ancestors preserved in amber.
Bit late for a warning I'd say.
Seems a bit.... derivative, doesn't it?
It's sexist, but I like it
This painting makes me cross.
I tried to capture the simplicity of telling my son, who sadly is no longer with us, to look both ways before sprinting across the highway.
I was told there was going to be Champagne.
It's a feminist piece.
Frankly, I find it almost pedestrian in nature.
I've always told you the signs add ten pounds
expert opinion is that this one is a forgery.
So, how ‘bout after this, we go stare at some headlights?
Yes, this new piece is less derivative, but why do they always go to the left?
I hate the lighting in this place. The whole "headlights" thing.
I do like the yellow though.
Try not to fawn over this one.
These early pieces are based on human depictions of us near highways.
He paints from life
Always the side view. Uninspiring!
Well son, I believe this is a good time for our conversation about the birds and the bees.
Banal and one-dimensional.
I agree, the new installation isn't as exciting, but surely there is something to be gained by moving it indoors.
Several on my mother's side posed for Remington.
This is driving me crazy, deer.
I could have painted that.
I completely agree, Louie: she is a DILF.
Fred, if we were about to cross the road and you saw this sign, what would you do?
There is a strong feminist influence.
This is the weirdest memorial I've ever been to.
It's feminine archetype signology rather than her usual patriarchy-oriented,herd-mentality,survival-of-the-fittest abstraction.
Don't you see? It can be both reductive of our essence and yet somehow uplifting at the same time?
Such an intense artist. He never saw or heard the car coming.
Ah, yes...a rare work by Jane Doe...
A Retrospective: 20th Century Deer in Headlights
I think it's derivative.
I just love it when our government helps support the arts.
It’s ironic that he got hit by the same pickup that his mother was strapped onto.
" Mother and child," you would've thought he could've been more original than that.
These prehistoric artists were able to depict our ancestors leaping and walking, but had not yet mastered the technique of three-dimensional representation.
Totally unrealistic body image but I like it..
I like them all, but I keep returning to the classic "Doe and Fawn".
Not a buck in sight. Typical.
Deer in the Limelight
He is a very talented artist but such a nihilist.
Van Doe's black on yellow period was very two dimensional.
I’m glad they put the headlights in the ceiling.
"Stag Party" -- is the title ironic?
Simply too abstract.
I love the way it just leaps out at you.
primitive yes, but moving.
This is all so surreal.
Stop fawning.
I preferred his earlier Lascaux stuff.
The mother got run over but the kid made it to a trophy room in Bozeman.
He says that one day it just struck him.
She looks so confident, doesn't she?
Seriously, we need more of these in the forest.
I can't help but fawn over this one.
OMG! She never told me I had a child!
This Roadkill Memorial really brings back the memories. Sure glad they have a gift shop.
Street art is always so much more authentic.
I take your points - but the does the ironic subtext really justify the exacerbating potential of Deer Lives Matter?
This one is by Vincent Van Doe.
Have you ever heard of the artist NYSDOT?
Much of Rudolph's earlier work depicted teen angst... the title of this piece here is "Don't Cross Me."
I just don't get outsider art.
Frankly, I find his school crossing work to be more appealing
So placid, so unhurried, so carefree. They're roadkill for sure.
I think that's my ex-wife!
An obvious lack of depth perception - no wonder they're a hazard.
This one was inspired by my ex right before she left with the kid. I call it, "Dear Double Crossing."
Bias assumed, this is a big step up from her fallen rock period.
Call me crazy, but I preferred the taxidermy exhibit.
This work says so much about the herd's condition and yet nothing at all. I love it!
I prefer modernist abstract warning signs over these figurative pieces.
If only these signs were this well lit in real life...
I've seen the signs, dude.
Her 'Bambi Years' are a bit too daunting for my taste
Does that silhouette make me look fat?
Neat, concise design but just not feeling it as a political statement. Where's the terror, violence, caught in the headlights, emotional loss?
I think she’s really captured that deer-in-the-headlights look.
I find his work two dimensional and repetitive. It just doesn't speak to me.
Those were dark days when humans drove cars.
I wouldn't buy it even if it did match our couch.
Pretty gender normative, if you ask me.
Call me a Philistine, but I swear it's been done before
But why did the deer cross the road?
He really captured their vulnerability
This one is entitled 'Look the @#$ Out!'
Deep.
Yes, it is representational, but he lacks depth. And, all his work has an eerie sameness to it.
Let’s go, the dude on my left just farted.
Andy Warhol he is not!
What is the artist saying here?
Agreed. But 500,000 acorns seems a little steep.
Finally, a relief from male images of dominance.
Early U.S. 15. I really prefer his later work, especially his State Route 27 period. It's usually regarded as only a brief interlude before his Interstate works, but I feel he reached he reached his peak in composition and color use in S.R. 27.
Yes, Dear, but is it art ?
I think this one really captures what it means to be a deer.
Daring. I heard the artist got shot.
We're talking big bucks for this piece.
His roadside period really speaks to me.
Hey, let's get out of here, you said this place would be crawling with Does.
Doesn’t need a caption...funny just as it is!!!
These must be from the her 'yellow' period.
life's a rut. And then you die.
It's priceless. It's an original Bambi."
I feel the artist is in a rut.
She's gained a lot of weight since this was done.
See -- even artistic geniuses can get into a rut.
And here we have the Madonna doe and child in yellow, portending his later martyrdom on the crossing.
It captures the tension , but not the depth.
They are certainly minimalist.
Ah, our evolution from two legs to four to upright two and opposable hooves.
A bit pedestrian for my tastes.
I warned you this exhibit would make you horny.
I don't know anything about art but I know what makes me horny.
There's a certain animalistic quality to this piece.
I was looking for something a little more non-representational.
Lovely madonna and child.
Quadrupedestrian.
Trust me--they are in a better place.
I've never understood what people see in these.
My mama posed for that sign and lived to tell the story
It lacks a human element.
I don't know art but I know what I like. Yowzah.
She was hot but I wasn't a family kinda guy.
I think it sucks.
Oscar Wild may coined "Life Imitating Art" but I'll bet he never dodged a 40 Ton Semi.
I had found some really good hostas, so missed the photo shoot.
I know that true artwork makes you feel uncomfortable but how about unsafe?
I don’t care what they say, road-kill prevention signs are not art.
Sentimental drivel.
That Darwin fellow said its for this that we do all the leaping and fighting.
Powerful symbolism -- it just leaps out at you, doesn't it?
Rather primitive
It's just too abstract for my taste.
At least we TRY to get out of the way.
I really like how the artist broke with convention.
It so captures the essence of "man with the headlights."
Not enough deertail in my opinion.
and then they asked your mother to pose as the model for the sign.. her whole life changed and she never came back home again.
Naturally, I prefer pointillism.
This one is titled "Mother and Child Xing"
Finally, works for us to fawn over.
It's a cautionary tale.
I know the deer that posed for these and believe me he's no stag.
I don't know... I've never really got these.
Yellow has always washed me out.
Nice postmodern exhibiting an ironical yet playful treatment of the fragmented subjects.
I can't define pornography, but I know it when I see it.
I resent how objectifying this is.
They're calling it "Abstract Elkspressionisn"
I can see its merit, but I prefer his No Hunting series.
They should put out warnings signs with this smut.
I think the subtext is more intriguing than the obvious message.
The yellow background adds 10 pounds.
This work screams caution.
Poor little Bambi doesn't know what coming next.
They're awfully naked
I see they moved the deer crossing to where there's less traffic.
Dada?
Remember when Briney and Diedra sat for that one .. they had to hold the pose for hours, with Pachelbel canon in d playing over and over and over .
I dunno, looks overly simplistic, flat and only 2 colors. We're so much more!
Life becomes somehow more profound in the abstract.
It’s hard to believe we evolved from that!
Can you imagine, The Times critic calls it, "pedestrian"?
Without context, I'm lost.
I just don't think it captures our grace.
Ah, those were the days, huh?
Ah, here it is, the famous 'Virgin and Child'.
When you think about it, the apes really were instrumental in distracting the humans during our takeover.
"I heard the artist demands big bucks for his work".
I don't know if it's art, but I know what I like
I grant that it conveys the subjects' emotional attachment with a certain accessibility and freshness, even immediacy. But without a stronger sense of montage, I find that it merely signifies in a hopelessly derivative way.
Well, these "family values" images aren't on the interstates as yet...
Ah, to be crossing the road again as a young stag!
It's about crossing boundaries.
His early work is very good, but his later stuff is utter roadkill
And yet, history teaches us nothing.
This one was inspired by our fifth poet laureate: Alfred, Lord Venison.
And this is my "Dear Crossing".
It feels pedestrian to me.
I find this to be totally deerivative.
They really should provide a trigger warning on these.
His work is very expensive given his untimely and ironic death.
Jane is *not* going to like what they've done here.
The art market is very stagnant right now.
I understand that the work is based on a Paul Simon song.
Notice how it downplays that caught-in-the-headlights look.
I'm getting a sense of danger from this piece.
I don’t know ... I find him so condescending.
This is a little too Bambi for my taste.
Got to tell ya, Ralph, the buck stops here.
This artist always paints our dark side!
It means we're no longer needed, she'll take it from here.
I was the first buck she ever made.
I just don't get modern art.
It manages to be poignant without being cloying.
I can't stop looking at it.
Less is more, but it's nothing to fawn over.
As much as I like simplicity I'd rather see the artist add some wild berries and nuts.
Are we set on yellow?
I prefer the DOT's non-reflective "Madonna and Child" myself.
It's better than a "Bullseye"
Yes, that's my wife, but that's not my kid.
I think this is a sign we should have a kid.
After these sell I think we should move into soup cans.
There is a nuance of line in this piece I don't find in the other works.
Do they actually target us?
I am transfixed every time I see one of these
There is a family resemblance
I would say our "keep the roads free for deers" campaign is a success. Where is our lobbyist with that ban on the headlights?
The amber background evokes the imminent danger Bambi's mother faces, and thus the artist reminds us of life's tenuous and fleeting nature.
Kind of makes you wish we weren't color blind, doesn't it?
Unless it's on their phone, do you really think they'll see it?
It must suck to become famous for your work when you're dead.
More stereotypes of the 'disengaged buck'.
The card says, “Deer Meandering.” What’s THAT all about?
You know Doris, I just don't understand modern art. What is the artist trying to say?
The exhibit represents a crossover point in the artist's career.
Primitive, but promising
It's a good thing she looked before she leaped
It feels a bit...derivative.
You can tell that the artist was at a crossroads.
Her recent red octogon series just wasn't moving.
Ugh, they never get it right. Those are elk, we are deer. When will they learn?
Can you belive it!: an art show at the highway administration!
I really love the artist's use of color in this one.
Decoration is asked to be dearly pleasing, dearly embellishing, and the functional logic of Modernism leaves no room, apparently, for such dearness.
Hmmm...yes....it's his yellow phase.
Ah. From his Madoenna Period.
I told you there was money in nude modeling.
For having thumbs, humans aren't great at drawing.
Would ya look at the antlers on that one.
You caught in ceiling lights, too?
I mean, I could do that.
OK, I'll have the brakes checked this week!
So this is the famous Jane Doe...
It’s called “The bucks stop here.”
These works examine the very essence of our existence and our relationships with human transportation
These have started the Cautionary movement.
Look Dasher, isn't that your wife and kid? It looks like they're the stars of this exhibition.
The Natural History Museum has gone leaps and bounds with this exhibit.
They are meant to give us a false sense of security.
It's about time we took a stand.
A tad doe-eyed for me to be honest.
This one has sexual harassment written all over it.
Middle Deer: Hmm, when did we use our arms to walk?
This one really struck me
Another Madonna and Child? How unoriginal.
It is misleading them. Deer lives matter.
How did we ever survive the internal combustion engine era?
Blitzen, old sport, maybe we should've fought a little harder for paternity leave.
Ah, this one's titled, 'Missing The Buck'.
It lies midway between sign and image. It is just as far from the literal prose of the utilitarian as from the diffuse poetry of the traditional image.
I think it is a sign of some sort
¨Why are they crawling on the ground like animals?¨
It´s a cross between a Remington and a Landseer.
This one's dedicated to my wife. I call it 'Dear Double Crossing,....'
I think that's Betty and her son Ronnie
Delightfully unexpected, yet lacking a certain ... je ne sais crois.
Got to be your relatives--no depth.
These were found on overgrown, ancient highways.
No, no, no...I'm not looking at her, I'm looking at the kid.
Why'd you come if you are only going to criticize?
I don't know why everyone is fawning over this one.
Humans, apparently, speed up for majesty and slow down for motherhood.
I may not know art, but I know what I like.
I like how he hides the details in shadows.
Have you ever seen so much photoshopping in your life?!?
These crossing signs are boring. When do we visit the Mating Season Rituals exhibit?
That's you and your mother before you learned to jump.
He was one of the most prolific artists of the last century.
This will really tie my den together.
Why yellow?
He's captured the frightened, deer-in-the-headlights emotions of the subject matter that's absent from his earlier works.
Bambi Warhol is a hack.
Nudes in modern art is so cliche'.
I disagree Carl. I find it hauntingly ironic.
It says the artist was born in Venice, son
"This stuff is tame. I was expecting something edgy like roadkill!
I've never been much of a fan of nouveau-roadkill.
Last month, it was a display of headlights.
The headlights in the ceiling make it hard to stop staring.
Buck, look at this one! They call it art.
Say, doesn't that look like Jane Doe and her kid before that terrible accident they had?
Life was so simple in the sign age.
All from a DOT warehouse, I think - no bullet holes.
I see that he is out of his rut.
I find this very insensitive to single fathers.
So placid, so unhurried, so carefree. They're roadkill already.
I'm caught here in the overhead lights.
Finally, something original
I think it means headlights are nearing"
Ok, I'll buck up: "derivative and misoginist"
What is it saying to you?
The composition, the configuration and, of course, the narrative...
Human art is so primitive.
Pop Art in the Wild.
Yeah, yeah. But it's all so deerivative.
Good, but not as compelling as headlights.
Too abstract for my taste.
I understand the 'after' renderings are housed in a separate gallery.
Headlights Retrospective
This one I painted from memory.
"New" Work? How about 2 stags and a baby?
Oh look at that, you were such a sweet little boy…
I like the family-oriented theme.
Thats the wife and kid.
And here we have the artist's muse
So poignant, yet I find the nudity rather gratuitous.
I guess this feministic work is just a sign-of-the-times.
I have always favored the nudes.
I like this one for school crosssings!
This one should sell for a lot of doe.
Oh well then you definitely won't like his later work.
Same title as the other two- "Deer Crossing."
I love what it says about the mother-child paradigm.
He only paints by headlight.
I guess I'll never understand this modern art.
Her earlier work was so pedestrian
Anyone know which is for undecided?
What do ya think? Yours or mine?
I was only three months old when that painting was done
But is It Art? Art looks a lot fatter.
My kid could have painted these.
After a while, if you’ve seen one “Madonna and Child” you’ve seen them all.
The geometric minimalism works in such unexpected ways.
I'm told this gallery usually gets a lot of traffic.
Hmm - Madonna & child theme suffused by an inchoate sense of foreboding...
I'm sick and tired of the single-mother trope.
It’s a sign of fertility.
Why do you always drag me to these things?
With you it's always my way or the highway!
It really creates a sense of foreboding
Let's over overcome the stereotype and say something.
I did not have sex with that doe!
Ma-DOE-nah and child. Rather trite, don't you think?
I see the juxtaposition of the outlines of the subject matter and the overbearing yellow holds some kind of warning.
Here you can see the influence of Walt Disney's 1942 film Bambi.
wow, her legs go all the way up the her shoulders! A true super model.
Ah yes, primitive
She's got your legs!
The artist is famous. I know I've seen his art somewhere before.
Long ago, during the war, humans used these to warn each other of our approach.
It's just all so pedestrian.
A whole series on our black brothers! How quaint!? Desert habitants?
It's well executed, but is it relevant today?
Back then, we seldom heard a discouraging word.
They say the sheet metal adds ten pounds.
Bambi, of course. But what IS the name of his mother?
Highly deerivative, if you ask me.
This one has real stopping power.
I still don't understand why this is considered so controversial.
This one's really deep.
MOMA: Deer In Headlights
Don't look up. Bob was frozen for hours last weekend by those lights.
Oh, look! This was taken prior to the Enlightenment Period...they are still on all fours....
This one's a little too serene for me.
Looks better with headlights
Crazy times when we used to live amongst animals
Maybe it's me, but I have trouble relating to this feminist art--it seems so pedestrian!
What does it for me is the warmth of domesticity, overlaid with that _soupçon_ of danger.
there's just something about this one that speaks to me
I don't think they capture our essence.
Personally, I like to be photographed by headlight.
Yet they still drive right into us.
Here he is with his mother before he became a DOT posterchild.
Will that caution sign change your behavior?
Looks like an early John Doe
I don't get it. What are we looking at?
It's really missing it's Xing.
Like a deer in overhead lights
You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.
And these are when we walked on all fours and were hypnotized by headlights.
Vincent Van Doe is a genius.
A sign of the times. More van Nogh than Gogh.
We used to be out there creating chaos.
Yeah, we met in the 60s and had a great time together. But the kid, she could have been from any one of us.
I always preferred his blue period.
I don't know--maybe it's a metaphysical study of what it means to be an edge species.
These would be better with headlights instead of recessed lights
Wait 'til you see the Jackson Pollocks.
The narrative is a cautionary one.
This one makes me horny.
Dasher has become such a sell-out.
She was cute but always played hard to hit.
This one makes me want to yell, 'Get out of the road!'
I suspect it would make more sense with the audio guide, but the damn things keep getting tangled in my antlers.
Oh deer. Oh deer. Oh deer.
Nice to get out of the woods every now and then, soak up a little culture.
I think it's a tasteful nude.
Look at the tail on that one!
We'll I'll be. Do you know who that is?
Even the title of the series, “Found Art,” is reductive.
I love this museum. No matter where you turn, you have the right of way.
You can tell, she's just in it for the bucks.
I wonder which part of this sign says hit us with a car
Quadrupedalism as art. I love it.
Just imagine: perfectly preserved, early deer cave paintings....
I find the work deerivative
Now this piece, Paternal Fawning by the late John Doe, is exemplary of the American transgender-crossover movement.
Their eyes seem to follow me wherever I move around the room.
The last time I saw this, I was struck by NSPR8TN. Unfortunately, it drove away.
Well, it's said that all the great artists started out doing family portraits.
‘Another rutting season weeks away and I am out of shape again… Jim relax, they’re photoshopped - I have never seen a doe that skinny in the wild’
I hear the stag had his own set of headlights.
I hear he derives his material from personal experience.
I'm liking this a lot more than last month's roadkill exhibit.
Bold forms. But the artist clearly intended for it to be naturally lit.
I still don't like the way he appropriates our culture.
For me it's a stark and cautionary expression of the mother-child dynamic.
I’ve always found they’re yellow period alarming.
What do you think it means?
Ever since abstract impressionism went out of style I do notice that we're hit by cars a heck of a lot less.
Caveman art is so much better, but at least we're not being hunted here.
I always crossed wherever I wanted
Since only stereotypes are being shown here, I think we ought to kneel.
Personally, I prefer his blue period.
I hear that the Smokey the Bear exhibit is breathtaking.
What is this, a horse? Where are the damn antlers?
It's overpowering. I'm gruntless.
My faun could do that.
The buck stopped there obviously !
We are NOT walking home...
"Matisse? No. National Geographics? Not sure.
I don't know about you, but I'm sick and tired of the Bambi narrative.
I don't know. I still find it a bit derivative.
I don't understand this modern stuff.
We still to this date wonder why the ancient human used these for their "roads"
That's an early profile of him, done before his career as an Xing sign model really took off.
It speaks to me....
He's in season, all right - I hear he's venison.
It just hits too close to home.
This is a creative alternate reality from the human crossing signs we normally contend with.
It doesn't speak to me.
I think it's too derivative.
This artist really captures us.
It's a rather mediocre Mother and Child in Headlights rendition.
I am really struggling to understand this one.
What a waste of time--especially for three bucks!
I'm not sure what the artist is saying either.
Such beautiful work and with this lighting I can't seem to look away
Seriously? My three-year old could paint that.
Human roads were some fucked up shit.
This overhead lighting reminds me of car headlights.
Ancient human heiroglyphs
I'll deny I said this ... but once you've seen one of us, you've seen us all.
Quit your fawning, it's just street art.
His work captures his sense of impending doom so palpably! Imagine what more he could have accomplished.
If you cross your eyes just right it looks like a sailboat.
They say art inspires primal instincts? Maybe that's why I want to charge the wall...
My thought is since we mainly get hit at night we should be orange and the sign should be black
What do you think the artist is trying to tell us?
These ancient artifacts are so illuminating. Hard to believe deer used to live like this.
I know it’s very literal, but we didn’t fair too well during surrealism.
We had no idea he'd be famous. It just seemed like an easy way to make 50 bucks.
"For verisimilitude, I'm told, headlights were chosen.
They will never understand us.
A fine example from his domestic period.
She looks fat in this one.
This NRA Art Gallery, Harry . . . are you sure it's not a set-up?
These are the signs that humans used to warn of our presence, before we took over.
If I'd only known!
I hear that if you stare for too long, you die.
That's what the artist wants you to think, but no, their the same size . . . one's just further away!
It's a sign that art is crossing a new threshold.
Bambi’s early work relies too much on foreshadowing for my taste.
I dunno...any 5-year old could do this.
The kid looks alot like you Ralph...
This one really makes you want to stop and think.
Must be a shortage of red nose stickers!
If humans crossed at signs like these we wouldn't have run over that grandma on Christmas Eve.
It must be outsider art.
His earlier work was more pedestrian.
Yeah, but where are they crossing TO?
He is best known for his yellow period.
I just don't see why it always has to be so political.
And here we have Mondeeron, abstract expressionist, "Madoena"
Ah, Vincent van Doe. Much more refreshing than that Buckson Pollock exhibit.
I don't know what I'm looking at here.
It all seems so mundane.
Too pastoral for my taste.
I always wanted to model.
You're right- it does resemble Ronnie. Before the accident of course.
I don't understand modern art.
I swear I met those two outside of Jackson Hole last fall.
I just don't like it, I'm a minimalist.
I'm convinced she'd still be with us if the sign had only had a buck on it.
Mondrian-Lichenstein influences are profound, but a nod to ‘Dogs Playing Poker.
She was warned about her frisky behavior.
Those were the good old days when we walked on all fours.
Caution dear, you don't want to buy the first one you've run across.
I thought that this was "stag night" at the museum.
Many of us died because of your Uncle Buck. He was sick and twisted. He stole these pieces for "art". If it weren't for the motorcycle accident that ended his life and brought attention to his work, we'd still be living in the forest.
Realism is so passe.
Modernistic, yet tempered by early 19th century sensibilities
In this early work, he was still exploring.
I find his work derivative.
Maybe I'm old fashioned, but I prefer staring into the headlights.
I like how they point out where to cross
Quit staring like a deer caught in spotlights!
This piece marked a significant crossover point in the burgeoning doeist movement.
Eh. My fawn could do that.
It feels obvious.
I really like this Madonna and Child.
I truly believe good art can change hearts and minds...
Why can't Peggy just use Facebook like everyone else?
It makes you ask the big questions like ‘Why do talking deer exist and why is this what we display in our art galleries?’
It speaks to me with a quiet intensity.
It's nice, but it doesn't seem right some how.
Fawn has grown up so much, hasn't she ?
I don't know. A greeting card maybe.
I find this one moving. He did the others just to make a buck.
These post modern works just don't do it for me like the old signs. And where is the 'deer xing' I ask you?
It wasn't so long ago that these were everywhere.
Well, you have to ask yourself how it will look in a forest.
His retrospective last year at the DMV was sensational.
Simple and sentimental, yet it speaks to me on primitive level.
She was a good model , but she got run over anyway.
The headlights really do add ten pounds...
It's good, but I still prefer the earlier Andeer Warhol, don't you?
Have you noticed that they always depict our women without a tail?
Who's the model for the new crossing artwork? She's hot!
Stylistically, he’s in a rut.
It’s widely believed that before they went extinct, humans revered us.
Keith Haring did it better.
I think I've come across this before.
This one is only two bucks?!
I see a little silhouette of a lamb. Didn't know that Freddie Mercury could paint.
I believe there's some doe in representational art once again.
I remember her. That kid could be mine.
How does it make me feel? Like a deer in the headlights.
At least it's not the 'deer in the headlights' look.
I have a sense of Caution when I view her paintings.
I liked his earlier headlight work better.
I've seen better art tattooed on my ass.
aren't we color blind?
Can't put my finger on it but this does look familiar...
Everything in here is big bucks.
My wife and little boy had to pose three days for this one.
...it has the vibrance of a Lichtenstein with the urgency of a NYDOT.
It says 'Deer X-ing' but was clearly also target practice.
So this is what they mean when they say "caught in the headlights"!
Retouching makes such a difference.
And that's the problem these days; the does are always letting the fawns take the lead.
Rich in atavistic symbology, yet calming and prosaic!
Post post modern art.
Color field, transitional stick figures...saved a lot of us!
Sometimes he missed the mark during his yellow period
What's the gender specific pronoun for John Doe?
This one really speaks to me.
It gets old, don't you think?
The symbolism is clear, it's the repetitive black-on-grey that loses me.
This color palette makes me feel safe and less vulnerable.
Gender stereotypes are still pervasive apparently.
His work was so much better before he went commercial.
I could fawn over this piece all season.
The prints really don't do justice to the originals.
A great artist, but a greater deeritarian, she saved millions of lives.
These lights are very distracting.
Her lines reveal the best of reindeer breeding. Makes you slow down and look.
Dear, this exhibit is so good I think they will probably be taking it on the road!
What do you think about this one, dear?
Curious,why are they all on a yellow background?
That's our latest grandchild!
Funny, I see an old woman in a scarf.
if he really wants to develop as an artist, he has to look beyond himself
Yes, an excellent example of post-minimalist Madonna and Child.
It's very sexist. Totally dismisses the srag"s critical role.
Ironic how the artist died
You know his prices have doubled since he got hit by that car.
As I read it, the artist has attempted to render several gender-focused cultural trends via a study in group portraiture: Equal opportunity, family values, and the buck stops here.
I think I liked his Ewe period better.
It might go well with the sectional.
I only modeled for the other ones.
A good rendition of Beatrice and little Buck, don't you think?
Bambi looks so much happier now that she has found a new home.
'Madonna of the Crossroad' by that early modern master. We're pretty sure humans gathered around these to pray to us.
Maybe self-driving cars will save our ass.
The lighting in this place reminds me of headlights. It's totally tasteless."
I see what the artist is striving for, but my mother would never let me lead when crossing the street.
I'm told this is from his fallow period.
I still can't believe it was only a buck to get in
I love the way he does children.
They were a species we now refer to as Two Legged Petroleum Burners
Ma-doe-na and child.
We were young and rent was cheap...
This piece is not worth a hundred bucks
I've never been a big fan of conceptual art.
He was the arguably the best wildlife artist ever known in the road department.
Have you ever noticed how it's always the doe home watching the fawn?
Crossing for wimps, I guess.
His work is very self-reflective.
His greatest masterpiece: "Birth of Venison."
I heard she just got divorced
"Jeez. I think I already saw this on the highway.
I can’t help but think it’s a warning.
It's called "save the women and children"
But does the world really need another Madonna and Child?
This one strikes at one's loins.
Hey look at that. Wait is that's me!!!!!!!
I find traffic art, amusing.
Eh...middle of the road, at best.
It's a sign for the family restroom.
Indeed. There are all dear to me.
Ahh, those dangerous days before Self-Driving cars.
This is from his Bambi period.
It's called 'deer in spotlight.'
Isn't that nice-they added Junior.
Say, I've got an idea for a racy magazine.
But what is the sign really saying?
There may be some lingering resentment.
They're reproductions, of course. It was would have been unethical to move the originals.
I must say I'm partial to the prancing bucks, but this one suggests a deeper meaning behind the seasonal rut.
I'm confused. Are these dressing rooms or warnings?
These were painted before the artist went mad and cut his antlers off.
I bet this one is worth a few bucks.
Deerly Departed
This leads me to believe that at one time there were African American deer.
Since the two-legged ones finally departed for Mars in their fiery chariots we have celebrated our freedoms every year on that date, Musk Day.
Sadly, this is the only known drawing of me and mom.
Very predictable. Two deer crossings and BINGO!
The still life paintings are in another wing. These are deer life paintings.
Life was a lot simpler back then.
That's Bambi, I'm sure of it. I'd recognize her anywhere.
I still didn't get paid for that sitting.
His images of family life are so evocative.
A lone mother? This is so gender normative! I guess they call human art primitivist for a reason.
I detest Impressionism.
Oh, dear. Just what we need, another conservative artist.
They're calling it Life Imitates Art!
... me a name I call myself ... and that will bring us back to doe doe doe doe ...
It's obvious that they're crossing, but what is the aesthetic trying to tell us?
It just doesn't make me feel safer
Why can’t you look like that?
I know it's a bit reductive, but I'm captivated by its vulnerability.
The normalization of pornography is both scintillating and alarming.
Hard to know, but I saw something similar in the Lascaux caves.
Although primitive and somewhat utilitarian, they do have a certain je ne sais quoi.
The Disney influence.
I find his work so reductive.
I misunderstood - I thought you said it was a Stag Party.
Don't worry, son, they are only reproductions.
Why should humans even care, they get a new car!
It's certainly modern, but I miss the Impressionists.
This really captures the family dynamic.
This piece really moves me.
It's just so quadrupedal.
This one speaks to me. Possibly because the doe looks a lot like my mother did.
Spoiler alert: Things don't end well for the mother.
I guess the buck doesn't always stop there.
Why depict them crawling I wonder?
What captivates me most is my objectivity.
. This was, of course, before his "Road Kill" period.
I think it should be hung a little lower
It says that humans used to view these pictures while driving at high speeds along paved roadways...how odd?
His primary models were Cecil and Doreen but they got hit by a car.
Eh...he's repeating himself.
Actually, I prefer action portraits over still life.
Watch how the eyes look like they are in the headlights when you move.
It seems like the artist might be in a rut
They keep getting the antlers in the wrong spot.
What is this?
They call it realism, but I'm seeing naturalism in its purest state... although it's a little dark.
But is it art?
It certainly provokes discussion.
None of this art is hung well.
And that's why you need to use protection son.
Did I ever tell you that my ex-wife was a model?
This modern art with all its nudity, well I don't like it son.
They're beautiful, but come from an unsigned edition.
Silhouettes on school bus yellow seem derivative yet convey a certain sense of ennui.
Derivative.
The artist seems to be playing with the concept of flatness.
I hate realism.
They're okay, I guess, but they really can't compete with the ones that the Lascaux people did.
I wonder what xing means
oh deer! we are on display
Yes, but as a buck, don't you think we're equally victimized by gender role stereotyping?
Hmmpf. Appealing to our animal instincts.
More pastoral, less alarmist certainly. Unlike his earlier phases , I agree.
I don't mind the people; it's the darn cars that concern me.
Cognitive doessonance
Black on dark gray, the artists color palette is inspiring.
The art is interesting...but the security guard with the hunting rifle at the entrance is a tad unsettling...
It feels so one-dimensional.
And this was during my Warning Period
I did that before it was cool.
Classic, yes, but I can’t help finding the Bambi School a bit cloying.
I miss mom.
It is surreal, because they are walking on four legs!
What do you mean 'it doesn't speak to you?'
It's the biggest exhibit of its kind, there are deer crossing signs for the next 3 miles.
This is it? These are our ancestors?
Nice rump, huh.
The original is hanging in the Houvre.
The lighting is all wrong. The headlights should be shining straight at the subjects, not down from above.
No. This is a Disney commercial.
Technically they are warning signs but I find them far more soothing than his last series with those bullseyes.
The works are staggered unevenly in this show.
His yellow period was his most creative.
Venison Van Gogh Museum.
Are they really doing anyone any good cooped up in a museum?
Let's go and see the picture of your Dad leaping, before that nasty tour bus turned up
I love the way these antelopes play.
I like how the use of yellow symbolizes headlights
Seems rather deer-ivative of his earlier work.
I know it's art, but do they have to be naked?
These artifacts predate the uprising, back when we pretended to walk on all fours.
She would have been a great mother.
Sexism is getting out of hand.
It moves me.
If you stare at it long enough and unfocus your eyes, you can see three-dimensional headlights coming right at you.
Today's our last day, tomorrow they bring in the Moose's.
Reminds me of an old flame I ran into.
We were so young and beautiful when we posed for this series.
since the artist died in a hit and run, my investment in these has doubled
They really captured her Silhouette
It really doesn't capture me.
It means 'Beware of silhouettes.'
It's post-Paleolithic
I am transfixed by her enigmatic smile.
I feel like this is a much larger statement about our proliferation as a species.
Our yearling could do better than this.
Try telling kids today what it was like growing up back then.
Further propagation of the stereotype that none of us are nurturers.
Call me biased, but I much prefer the Fawnist movement to the Fauvist one.
Back in the day, we used to be signs.
I can't seem to appreciate the artist's message under these lighting conditions.
There's a neo-crypto-feminist slant that betrays a patently fawning need to please.
When I heard this was a Dada exhibition, I didn't expect to see my father.
I posed for this as a fawn.
I told her she could take him but not to stop to take pictures.
That looks like my wife and daughter.
His work is too derivative.
They're not as smart as we think !
Looks just like her mother.
I miss them so much...
I just love the contrast.
It doesn't seem ironic to me. Now Warhol's soup cans. That's irony.
He didn't get the nose quite right
We had so much fun, when we were young, didn't we?
The relative reality of the likeness to our species, is in and of itself, reactionary.
I find them derivative and simplistic.
For, a Deer, a female deer........
How come everyone always looks like they're having more fun than me?
Transitive art. Always a favorite.
I think it's an expression on helicopter parenting.
It doesn' t convey the angst of his other work.
Just another bit of art that hammers absentee fathers.
This one is from his early black on yellow period.
No, it wasn't Oliver Stone or Francis Ford Coppola. It was Michael Cimino.
Makes me want to dart across the street just to show them I'm not so one dimensional!
I think I knew her.
Strangely, the domesticity of this scene both attracts and repulses me.
The 'Does Matter' movement is having an effect
Quite endeering, wouldn't you say?
Don't you think the fawn looks a bit like me?
Not a big fan of his still lives.
Where's the trigger warning?
They might as well just put up a big sign that says, "here we are - go ahead and shoot!"
But you could see it as the doe nudging the fawn into traffic, in which case the piece takes on a whole new meaning.
On the whole, I like Remington better.
That's me and mother - she died on route 80
Bambi’s Mom. Breaks your heart.
She's had work done.
His earlier work was soooo sentimental!
This one makes me look fat.
That's Dave. Before he lost his visitation rights.
The subaqueous qualities of the spatiality tend to...CAR!!!!
You don't see the real detail without headlights.
I find road art rather pedestrian.
I preferred the artist's last show, out on Old Route 7. This venue feels much too safe.
Bambi's mother? I fucked her.
Indeed, the artist's fertile period.
It lacks depth.
I find the overhead lighting startling
See these everywhere.
Did Schjeldahl say the art world is a safe space for the dominated or denominated?
Those were the days
I hear they call it found art.
So prosaic... I much prefer works from his "post-collision" period.
I just can't accept that we descended from those creatures.
How can it symbolize "Deer Crossing" if it doesn't have antlers?
Another VanDogh? My hooves are killing me!
By passing the buck, we'll save some doe.
It's a remarkable use of reflective sheeting... much brighter than I expected.
Curb Your Fawning
I passed the buck.
cold be yours, could be mine
Without the post, it's not modern.
This was recovered more recently - also of unknown origin, but demonstrating a primitive appreciation of form.
WE NEED A SIGN TO PROTECT US FROM THE HUNTERS.
Does life imitate art or does art imitate life?
More than a bit kitschy, wouldn’t you say? … I much prefer his blue period!
That's a nice likeness of Mom and Bambi.
It was his "In the Headlights" period.
I'm rather fawned of this one
Be honest. Does this picture make me look fat?
The original is so much smaller than I expected
Honestly, this piece feels a bit deerivative.
I call this series "Deer In Recessed Lighting"
This one doesn't really leap off the canvas
I think Mother-Child art is an over used cliche.
Obviously airbrushed.
I, for one, am encouraged by the inclusion of the female graze.
Why are they always minimalist silhouettes?
We should never have sold the rights to the photographer.
We can always count on the DMV to put on the best art exhibitions.
I think they call it 'road art'.
I think they needed a Dad in that one too - creates even more sympathy.
I like these so much better than his ‘Construction Zone’ show last year.
I believe I slept with both of the models.
I just feel like my fawn could have made this
You know, my cousin Donny saw one of these in the wild. An Elksy, if I'm not mistaken.
I really yield to this artist's work.
I must admit, parenthood can certainly cramp one's style.
our relationship didn't last the season
The panel on the right is feet crossing in. The panel on the right is feet crossing out. The panel on the center is the well known The Buck Stops Here.
It’s a classic, dear.
I just don't get abstract art.
I'd get caught in headlights to paint like that.
Just a bit self-reflexive, n'est-ce pas?
These are much too commercial to be considered fine art.
This one is very rare indeed. I've never seen one in all my crossings.
Dear, a doe?
This place sucks.
Poor bastards.
I told you having to walk the dog every day would suck
I think his Red Period pieces are actually better.
I pass by a poor imitation of this in my neck of the woods, it can never convey the beauty of the original.
I really see myself in these.
I call this "Taking My Sweet Damn Time".
It loses something without the headlights.
Really? That's where we come from?
It's nice to see representationalism making a comeback.
These pieces only reinforce hackneyed stereotypes
These liberal artists always glorify single motherhood.
I have never been too fond of the classics...
But do you see it as the driver, or as the car?
And to think that humans once drove their own cars.
look at these doodes ...
Personally, I feel that artwork like this only serves to advance the notion of the "four hoofs on the ground" stereotype.
Now that's what I call Realism
Trust me - you don't want to mix with the crowd viewing the "Rats in the Subway" exhibit down the hall!
Oh deer. I am not fawned of this.
No, I don't like it that much. I'm just frozen under these headlights.
How far have we come
I'm okay with this stuff, as long as they show the headlights !
These "Studies in Yellow" are fine but I prefer his Blue Period.
It lacks a human element.
These are from the 20th and 21st century - the dark ages.
I, for one, am tired of the Bambi references.
Impressionism is dead.
This lighting always gives me tunnel vision.
She's a DILF
And they just stood there when they saw headlights coming?
too representational
Finally, an accurate depiction. It’s “game crossing,” not “game leaping.”
This one speaks to me.
This is what happens when we give the doe's the vote and let them be artists.
I guess the buck stops here.
I priced this piece one buck less.....
I really like it, but it's a lot of doe.
This collection is called 'Death'. The artist attempted to capture the last image we see before we go.
come to the deer museum... it only costs three bucks...
The cave paintings are much better and you get to go to France.
Such an endearing gallery
No, that outfit doesn't make you look fat.
They were illustrations showing drivers what to hit.
They see potential tragedy. So do we. That shared point of view is what interests us both.
Still life with fawn.
Black lives matter
You looked so young then.
Modern art is so pedestrian.
This. This takes me back.
The turning point was when we actually started reading these.
Not long after that she was shot.
How come you don't look like that anymore?
I don't feel like the artist is speaking to me.
This one bucks the trend.
The artist was drastically underappreciated during his career.
What's your sign?
Serene ... but overall, perhaps a bit too formulaic.
As design, I like it. But is it art?
I think we look better with a green background
I love the texture, the posture, the lady-stepping. Finally, a doe who refuses to prance.
We would have been majestic and elegant but for evolution.
The Madonna and child. Very powerful.
During the rut she said, "Nice rack. Big, strong.," so I thought... and then Buck came along.
Apparently this Xing fellow is very prolific.
I’d buy it, but it’s too much doe.
Wow, The Yorker can now afford color
They all look like 'deer in the headlights' to me.
They should make this into a movie.
The museum has been accused of pandering to its audience, but I just don't see it.
Not my better side
I also posed for this one.
His art is half gay and half incest pedophilia. I guess Freud was right.
I have a print of this at home.
Expensive but worth the investment for my road.
And in this scene, Bambi's mother first realizes it's a forest fire, not a sunset.
My first, but she's gone now; a victim of the 'bump stock.' It's legal, you know.
How endeering.
That was me as a youngster. She taught me everything about where to cross.
The breakout stars in the movement were renowned for their heroic antics and obsession with classicism. The implied misogyny was later exploited.
Yeah, he's a one-trick pony; but I DO like this one
This is way too abstract for my tastes.
I prefer landscapes.
It would've been a nude, but her fawn showed up.
I disagree, these painting are not from his Yellow Period, they represent his expression of the Triangularist movement.
Well – the invite said stags only.
I think it’s a sign of reflection.
I think that’s my ex Xing.
Art imitating life!!!!
I don't know why this art's called "Deer In The Headlights". But I am quite mesmerized.
I see a little silhouetto of a deer
Notice the unique perspective.
Narcissistic and self-indulgent, if you ask me.
I'm not sure why, but this one gives me a boner.
I knew him before he turned commercial.
I really don't get modern art.
A five years old deer could have painted this
I preferred his performance art
I see the artist striving to express himself outside of the strict public works tradition.
So this is what they call "deer in the headlights?"
milf.
This ones called Road Kill.
I saw this van gogh by the road yesterday
Yes Bambi, They are your baby pictures
It's a good silhouette, but not a great silhouette.
Oh dear. My four year old could do that.
These were during his yellow period
The commentary on relationship between mother and child is superb.
Junior sure enjoys those Playdoe Magazine Posters.
You're right--it is rather derivative.
Don't you just love self-portraits of famous artists?
Primitive yet fascinating.
I wonder, do we cross for the pursuit of art or does art exist because we cross?
That's a lot of doe
DEAR GALLERY PRESENTS: the crossroads of abstract symbolism
I don't get this one at all.
This one is on my buck-et list.
The brushwork is a little crude but I think I understand what he is trying to say.
I hear the artist has been delayed by traffic. Let's go grab a bite.
I favour landscapes over portraiture.
There she is with Bambi and there he is carousing around looking for distractions on the highway.
This one's a little dear.
I don't know if it's art, but I like it.
Portraiture bores me.
Had they known what was coming, they certainly would never have made these signs.
Brilliant...From his Stag Night period, I believe.
I’ll admit, they have a certain je ne sais quoi.
Hmm. It looks like Uncle Charlie.
It's from his ma-doe-na and child series.
Well, I don't think they had alimony issues at that time.
I just wish he'd use my good side.
I don't know much about deer crossing signs, but I know what I like.....and she's hot.
It's Pop but is it Art?
It speaks to me of the nagging angst of four lanes.
Four legs good, two legs better!
Exhibition at MODA
Oh my goodness, Bella, you were such a cute little fawn before you were caught in those headlights.
His style has evolved since his drawings for Bambi.
"Mother and child"....sooooo overdone.
Before the North Korean war, ancient humanoids worshipped our ancestors.
Ah, yes, the Madonna and Child.
"Ce n'est pas un cerf" - I don't get it.
I thought it was a one night stand
Okay okay it's mine, but that was seven years ago.
She sent me a “Deer John” when she found out she was pregnant!
I'm guessing the artist is working through some daddy issues.
Now I gotta pay fawn support.
Now this speaks to me in a way the shiny "balloon deer" never will.
No, that's definitely Martha.
The memories are too painful, I must leave.
It was like that before we moved to New Jersey.
My fawn could do better than this.
Where I come from, that's not art.
I liked his early work, but now he's just repeating himself.
It's remarkable what this Bambsi is doing for street art these days.
He does not show us reality the we want to see it but like it is.
I dunno Jim, something about that fawn just doesn't sit right
And this represents our public façade, you can say…on all fours.
He had an unyielding vision.
I'm disappointed. He's giving us the same old same old.
They're just so ... derivative.
Look at the fine details in this iconic image of the Madonna and Child!
Another single mother struggling to support her child. This is what happens when young bucks get crazy and try to outrun bullets, son.
Not another Madonna and Child ...
I'll check to see if Vermont pays residuals
I didn't say "Venetian" painting, I said "Venison."
I was never much for modern realism...
That was my wife and daughter before a texting driver took them away.
I like this one -- it doesn't jump out at you.
Reminds me of walks with our kids...
That's it? Silhouettes?
I always have trouble with abstract art.
Stagus erectus: ruminating on ascendency to bipedalism.
Why do they even need a sign for that?
So what's your thoughts on family planning?
Evolution? I don't buy it frankly.
I love the expression of vulnerability...
I love the Elkhart museum.
I know, right? It's like, dude, if Darwin was never born, evolution wouldn't have even existed.
Reminds me of my first doe.
His later work gets a lot darker.
When someone from your hometown makes it big.
Here, I'll explain it to you.
He produced this following his rut period.
Oh dear. That's really something.
More like Deer Crossing Legs. Haha.
It's s a bit derivative
I much prefer this to his school children period.
This is the last thing my mother saw before she was run over.
I've never set foot in Maine!
I readily yield to your interpretation, though I maintain that there are elements of Dada that cannot be ignored.
'Madonna and Fawn' by The Master of Interstate 80.
This one clearly is Sexist
Trust me, young man, stay away from these if you can.
I find this work quite pedestrian.
It's derivative. Stop fawning over it.
Why did they amble to their deaths? For a moment of glory on a road sign?
I love the Realists.
Perhaps ... but I tend to read his work allegorically.
This one really struck me - like I was in the headlights.
Finally, someone bucking the trend!
I've always found their work to be a bit pedestrian
Jean Doe's 'Les Biches' from his Jaundice Period.
Do you see that guy behind me? He's staring at my crotch.
I miss her too Bambi
Boys, it’s time you learned about the birds and the bees.
Such dark times.
Remember this picture when Sherman was content to be by our side. Now look at him, longing to join the rest of the herd.
Needs a pop of red!
The artist was Chinese. Each family could only have one.
No, leave it there. I'll call it 'Deer in the Headlights.'
We're currently in litigation over graphic misrepresentation.
Big Bucks for Art!
I think the guard is beginning to suspect we're not human.
I can't understand what they thought was so controversial.
It says that this was Bambi's first appearance.
I really respond to this new Alarmist work.
I’m having a Proust moment seeing my mother and me quadrupedal and all.
Your wife has great legs.
His earlier work was better, but this one's a forgery!
Ahhh, life before car phones.
You think it targets drivers with children?" "Don't say targets
They're not prancing 'cause it's Still Life.
I don't know, Rudy. DOE CROSSING just sounds so girly to me.
She reminds me of my mother.
You choose. These make me feel like a human in the headlights.
Do you think she has implants
Why didn't you use birth control?
Ah. The definitive Madonna and Child!
I'm just not into animal realism.
i THINK SHE'S CAPTURED THAT 'PERSON IN THE HEADLIGHTS' LOOK.
I can't find any meaning in this work.
I prefer the action ones.
The violent treatment of his subject matter is tempered by his unusual chiaroscuro technique.
I'm still partial to his 'No Hunting' series.
Typical artist: he played the field; they split up and now he's on the rebound.
What's your take on this family bathroom stuff?"
The artist is a deer friend of mine.
Is it still cultural appropriation when it's this beautiful?
Fawnvism?
The funny thing is, that guys name is Art.
I see why the critics are fawning over this one.
I did say maybe we'd buy something. But it's just too dear.
A facile appeal to sentiment, don't you think?
Can you believe that they used to walk on four legs.
I remember when they took that picture, you were just a baby.
May as well be sitting ducks.
A bit pedestrian.
It's derivative.
And this one represents the protectiveness of motherhood.
How long are you gonna fawn over this?
Jane was horrified when she learned humans are using this for street art.
I'm afraid I prefer those cave paintings.
He's known for very still lifes.
Derivative stuff. Let's move on.
Never a stag party.
He does a consistent job of signing his work.
Hey they forgot to capture us!
This one just doesn’t leap out to me!
She's got her mother's legs.
I didn't even know she was married.
You really know how to throw a stag party.
I can't believe it...I dated her in high school!
No entry. This does not need a caption.
Wasn’t I cute?
Well, this is new and different, but it lacks the dynamicism of his other works.
Very Andy Warhol.
Ever since she modeled for this one, there's no talking to her.
The signs really say, 'go!'
Some say his Blue period was his best, I on the other hand have always thought his Yellow period was his most important.
The artist is crossing the line with this new exposition
I love how the artist captured none of them.
Well, I like it, but I'm not gonna lock horns over it....
He swears it's him.
Audacious artistry. And yet stunningly personal. It is as if I finally see myself.
I told my ex and that daughter of ours that I would make them famous one day.
If life imitates art then we need to stop going these things
Its both a warning and a moment in time for me.
It doesn't capture the motivating force behind the action.
This is from his realism phase. You won't believe what came next.
All it says to me is that we're missing rutting season again.
So many layers. Such complexity. Only a genius could have done this.
I'm not sure we need another "Madonna and Child" in this day and age.
These things were ubiquitous before humans evolved Musk.
Remarkable. I understand the painter was in prison.
I-495 Memorial
Ah, the 70's. The beginning of the end for the nuclear family.
How can Timmy be taking so many selfies without any opposable thumbs?
The modern portrayal of doe and fawn actualizes very nicely here.
The result of the other sign.
I think it's meant to be ironically feminist.
I hate this one; it makes my butt look big.
We don't live in a vacuum.
And this one is called "Madonna and child" from his early period.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Mother & child... once again, no father in the picture.
O'Deer Look At That
This exhibit includes pictures of my first two jumps and my final suckle."
Finally, an exhibit with substance.
That's a gimmick sign, designed by the NRA to lure young members.
I only come to these things for the free food...
A rather unimaginative color palette
I think the artist has caught the essence of life, rebirth.
She looks familiar.
I titled this one:: Ma Donner and Child.
Mom looks so young in that pocture
Who knew representaions like this could be so endearing?
I just don't understand his Bambi phase.
It's so unfair. They didn't even pay me a buck for this.
Reminds me of when you were just a deer in the headlights.
Is it 'deer' or 'deers?'
My doe could have drawn these.
It's called "Deer Crossing."
"Deer Crossing" I get, but "Bambi," "Petting Zoo," what???
Just enjoy the art, deer; we can discuss gun laws later.
Pedestrian, yes. But yet they speak to aspirations of geonerations past.
"A four years old deer could have painted this"?
Classic Double Cross
I appreciate what the artist is doing, but I can't help thinking it borders on exploitation.
My late cousin was illiterate.
Sad. If they could have gotten a picture credit, the royalties would have kept them in clover.
"Road to Bethlehem". Hmm... I don't get it.
They never even saw it coming.
Hmmm…this cautionary, feminist perspective is a little edgy
I could never really understand modern art.
I wish those were NO HUNTING signs!
I told you! Black makes me look skinnier.
Did you read in ARTnews that I-95 is suing for repatriation?
More color would be nice.
They're just not the same without the danger element.
Did you notice the unusual splash of color on this one's shiny nose?
No, you're thinking of last week.
"This piece is called 'MaDoena and Fawn'".
It would be more realistic with bullet holes in the sign.
This must be from the artist's Cautionary Period.
The Fawn-Roe hypothesis is that hominids worshipped us.
Henry dear, doesn't that look an awful lot like Marcia and her second fawn?
It's not the most flattering, but it's good to be featured.
Look at that flying Hoover hover!
I didn't know Nancy had married!
I'm really fawn doe this one.
Cal Trans was a huge influence on my work.
I like the one from 1999 better
confustion
It speaks to me....
This exhibit is on loan from Route 58.
Not a very good likeness.
They had no concept of perspective in those days..
They say it's actually a picture of his mistress.
Rubenesque.
I'm all for art but some people will display anything to make a buck.
If this included a chicken, it would definitively state the objective.
Bambi: A Retrospective.
They always manage to work in a pastoral scene.
You take a nice picture.
You know, she only did it for the money.
Stop griping already! It's tasteful. You weren't really nude and neither was I.
I never liked his early work.
It lacks the usual joie de vivre.
Black lives matter
Evidently, they never developed a written language before they became extinct.
These will never sell.
I prefer landscapes.
I don’t understand it. But I like it.
With its roots in the 1930's, the Yellow Period has proved surprisingly durable, inspiring countless derivative works.
Thank God it’s not Picassoesque. Otherwise there would be more road kills.
Well this sucks.
I am not "fawning" over her
She got cusdody
She reached the pinnacle of her talent in painting the State Route 17 Series. It's also the place where she got run over.
The use of space in this work is as eye-catching as headlights
I love the use of colors
I prefer Match.com.
I'd give her a 10 if it weren't for the kid.
Frankly? It's patronizing.
When I was a young buck I thought she was the most free-spirited wild thing in the forest--I trumpeted and rutted like crazy to get her to look at me. Those were the days!
I don't mean to sound insensitive, but Bambi's mom had it goin' on.
She was one of Rudolph's favorite models.
Yes, you DO look a bit hippy.
I BET you two bucks and a fawn HE gets hit by a car by friday.
Modern art, or Realism? That's the question.
What you call childish, I experience as representational purity.
He really captures the gestalt.
I knew you fawned over that doe.
Don't be fooled. 'Grazing in the Suburbs' is meant to turn more humans against us.
We’re getting into a rut - let’s go to a different museum next week.
Do you mean Fauvism?
Note the creative use of black.
I read on Wikipedia that Realism is a revolt against the exotic subject matter and exaggerated emotionalism and drama of the Romantic movement. I totally get it now.
Don't you think that the headlight motif is a bit much?
Even that didn't help with distracted drivers.
I hate deer season. It’s all about guns and us.
The antlers are all backwards. Except for this one.
I'm not sure which of us he looks like.
Such tragic poignancy in this this piece!
I thought there would be more does at this opening than just this painting....
It's as if stay-at-home bucks don't even exist!
A tragic encounter with an SUV sadly kept Rupert from basking in the worldwide acclaim his work enjoys today.
Every year it's the same, safety warnings for us, whiskey and mince pies for him.
I don't get it" "It's a famous piece. I forget who it's by, but I see it everywhere.
I don't always feel like leaping wildly; sometimes I just like to amble across the road like this doe and fawn.
I think it is just so derivative
The artist calls this exhibition "Let Us Prey".
Tragic really. Earl was shot to death as he was teaching Junior to 'look both ways before crossing'.
At last - they've finally gotten around to using some plus-size models.
The humans were so busy with politics, they couldn't even see what was right in front of them.
Unfortunately, the artist has gone missing.
Clearly, another Mary Cassatt ripoff.
”Oh, a Madoenna and a child”!
She was my muse.
I don't think the signs really warn them. We'll just have to jump on their windshields.
Dad was thin back then.
It says create
Yes, I have talent, but I put my pants on one leg at a time just like any other bipedal deer.
This one seems to be missing something...
This was a reflection of the rising feminist movement that originated on the edge of the forest.
I've always admired his yellow period.
Rather humanistic.
I love family portraits....
It’s his second movement in yellow...
I don't wish to fawn all over it, but these look great
They ran Mama over and raised me as a human. What's your backstory?
Nice to see them in the exhibition but I was never sure he was really mine; she was a real slut.
Street art is an acquired taste.
I can't make up my mind if this primitive art represents the struggle of man to contain his animal impulses, or the struggle of deer to civilise itself.
I miss Picasso.
Sure, the instrument of death is different but this work is derivative of the hunters of Lascaux.
How on Earth did a photograph of me and my Mom end up here?
It's how the humans viewed us before the uprising of '24.
It really captures the zeitgeist of helicopter parenting.
As far as I'm concerned, it's fawnie porn.
Where are the signs that say "bear right" or "bear left"?
This one is called 'Crossing the Road Together.'
But Deer, this costs too many bucks.
I see a commentary on the day we let them cross the road without us.
I see it as an admonition on the folly of life
That’s a deer, dear.
I think it would have more impact on me if I weren't color blind.
It will sell, I suppose, but to me it lacks the je ne sais qua of his 'Bambi Road Kill.'
How primitive we were before The Revolution.
I'm having trouble relating to this one.
That's scat!
These are from the artist's YIELD period.
So THAT'S what drove him to finally hack off his other antler.
Well frankly I think he made me look fat.
I’m struck by its simplicity.
Thank God self driving cars will make these dumb art exhibits obsolete.
It looks amazingly like my wife and kid.
Primitive humans have always revered us.
Reminds me how your deer mother fawned over you.
A fine example of his deer caught in the headlights phase.
Always the Bambi card with this guy.
MILF Crossing
I believe its an early work of the Dutch artist, Van Doe
This composition raises serious questions of issues of identity in relation to post humanism.
Many say his untimely demise may have been avoided had he executed this one during daylight hours.
It's a Venison Van Doe.
Way too Bambi-esque for me.
I believe that these are from his "Deer in the Headlights" series.
Kinda makes you feel bad for driving here, huh?
She's a feminist.
We're all just deer caught in headlights.
School zone.
I like his red octagon period better.
Through the use of shadow, the artist encourages us all to stop and reflect.
Yep, the buck stopped here, Son.
I thought it was time to branch out.
I'm thinking their demise had to do with their poor aesthetics.
Entre nous, when I go camping that’s how I walk.
I hear he got his start with the zebra crossing.
The heteronormative depiction of family is completely antiquated. This artist is so circa 2002.
You know, he was quite unherd of until this exhibit.
There are aspects of minimalism, but I think postmodernism best defines it.
It doesn't just happen to the birds and bees, son.
A bit cautious for my taste.
You know, I'm not sure about these nudist museums.
Definitely lacking in gender fluidity, wouldn't you agree?
They asked me to pose, but yellow isn't my best color.
I love the use of colors
The proportions are all wrong.
This is going to be the next big thing.
I believe this movement was called Sign-Post Impressionism.
Xing really should start to sign his artwork.
It's the earliest known painting of Bambi.
Pretending to be interested in random stuff on the walls when you don't know anyone at a social event.
Beats a Jackson Polluck any day.
Good boy Toto. I don’t think we’ll be in Kansas much longer.
Wouldn't it be nice if, for once, they showed the headlights?
Meh. Same old, same old.
Art? Porno? All I know is it makes me horny.
yeah, say what you want about this representing some primitive form of self-expression… I still think my kid can draw better than that.
You didn't tell me about her!
This one looks like he was caught in the headlights.
We discovered this portrayal of him as a child
Is that a picture of my mom and baby me?
Two deer, too dear.
That's mom and me in the days before cell phones.
Historians believe the artist was having an affair with the model.
School zone.
Graphically bold, and functionality to boot, I like it!
How do you know YOU'RE not the father?
I hate how everyone fawns all over his work.
Walking on four legs was so 1990's.
...Reminds me of the years when I was living in Central Park...
I have always been a great fan of plein air paintings.
Myrtle said they shot her bad side, but I just don't see it.
Thumper's absence is almost palpable, isn't it? So powerful.
They never show us making s'mores.
They really captured us well. Feels like yesterday...
These works really make people want to slow down and look.
The buck stopped somewhere else.
This one is from the highway protest of 95. It was a big hit.
That's a fine resemblance of Martha and the little one.
Andy Warhol he is not!
This wall is a powerful display of the effects of male suicide on single motherhood
Now this one reeks of sentimentality ...
I'm pretty sure I saw this one where your mother died.
Gross. Look at those ugly creatures.
Whoever the DOT artist is really needs to expand beyond silhouette work.
What do you think about this one for the south meadow? I love how the artist captures the strength in her antlers.
When the security guard looks the other way, let's grab it and run!!
I could do that.
I prefer artists who throw caution to the wind.
Oh, I like it. I think it’s very funny.
The deer get to vote on the new design for the yearly crossing signs, due to political correctness it was getting harder to decide.
Enjoy it now. Admissions have been dying.
It was a simpler more innocent time.
OK. I get it. Its a 'Watch for deer and fawn sign.' Like our relatives. But does the deer identify as a deer, a moose, an elk, or even as a donkey?
I hope the museum closes soon. I'm stuck in these headlights.
For my taste, it's too derivative.
I believe this was from his “preBambi awareness” period.
I still prefer his un-signed work
It's derivative.
His art was always blasé for me... two color... no depth and the same boring subject.
This is Edouart's best work.
I much prefer formalism to this street art.
Superb effect and marvelously invokes motion!
His new work is banal compared to his earlier "Taxidermy Series".
You've lost weight.
Another droll, elementary depiction, evoking no emotion whatsoever. Why humans insist on promoting this work worldwide is something I'll never understand.
I don’t think it’s my best side
He didn't get the backlighting right.
He was most prolific in his "Highway Modern" period.
If the signs read 'car xing' instead, they would still be with us.
I don't get modern art.
I didn't know Sarah had a fawn.
I'm not a fan of this new Feminist art.
It shows a prehistoric worldview where our ancestors could cross the road only at the sign.
It's just so deerivative.
I can never remember when mating season opens.
It's rather sexist, if you ask me.
'DEER CROSS-DRESSING!'
He seems to be evolving from minimalism to mamaism.
It means you can cross with your kids.
Hmm...I don't remember her name, but I think her fawn could be mine.
Oh, some primitive species from the pre- nuclear extinction event. The artifact record depicts us as gods, as well as apes and the "Far Side" pantheon.
Wilma I'm telling you that's cousin Earle last fall right at the beginning of the rut.
CAUTION: Headlights in next Gallery.
You see, life does imitate art.
Tsk. Cultural appropriation at its worst.
Deer in the Limelight
I think Disney has lost its magic.
Most of his work has that compelling, "Je ne c'est quois," cachet. This piece? Meh. Just a couple of "rien deers."
Why must they drag the children into this?
This one really captures the deer.
Really doe?
The artist wants you to slow down.
Dear, I told you he would like prancing more than family time.
And they said Realism was dead.
I resent the artist’s privileging the female’s role in the childrearing relationship.
It's about man's inhumanity to deer, of course.
Every time I see it, I get that “in the headlights” feeling again.
It highlights the subtle essence of that song, "doe a dear, a female dear."
What is it we find disturbing about his work?
Hmm...seems a bit derivative.
Something about the nude figure brings out the philosopher in me.
Why do humans always hang these paintings at an angle?
This one was before the feminist movement took hold.
Excuse me; females are smaller and don’t have antlers
We are all pawns in the game of life and death.
This is all they could salvage from I-95
This one is called 'Headlight Scenario.
Technically they are excellent but lack the warmth of Annie Leibovitz
I find his work derivative yet with merit.
These recently discovered drawings depict our more primitive beginnings
That's My Elizabeth and Audrey.
They call that art? It sure didn't do Uncle Wilfred any good.
Ihat's the wife and kid just before they tried to cross the LA Expressway.
His later period shows a more subtle use of light.
Remember, hunting season opens a week after this exhibit closes.
It makes me look fat
Just another preachy artist filled with cautionary tales.
His "In Headlights" period is sublime.
It's not so much what the artist sees - it's what they make others see.
Does this painting stagger ewe, deer hart?
His work just feels so pedestrian to me.
My ex and I share custody.
Now, to me, this one seems to convey a certain quiet, lurking sense of brutal automobile damage.
We don't have that kind of dough, dear.
It lacks the freedom of his earlier work.
I just think it's a bit...obvious
You'd never know from her pictures that she had a lot of doe.
If they had only paid attention, she would be with us today.
Hey, Dad, isn't that Uncle Buck?
The artist is quite prolific but lacking imagination or depth
It's a different side of their work than you see in the wild.
Too avant-garde for me.
Does this remind you of last Thanksgiving when Buck ate the fermented berries and then played chicken with traffic at Miller’s Bend?
It gives one pause to reflect, don’t you think?
I find his "Yellow Period" to be terribly derivative.
That says to me, "And a fawn shall lead them."
They wrote it's speciesism and he's a self-hating-deer
That's the sign they use to tell us where cars are XING us!
While lacking verisimilitude, it does, in a raw way, illustrate the myriad horrors of postmodernity.
Much too retro for my taste.
And here's your great aunt Bertha from your mothers' side of the family... may she rest in peace... and your cousin Buck
Who would have thought that his work would evolve from this into his "Caught In The Headlights" period?
I prefer abstract art
So I told her that the sign didn't make her butt look too big.
It just doesn't have the hart of her other work.
The corporate sponsor is John Deere.
Such a dear family.
It might sound sexist but I really like this one best.
It’s amazing how fast this one got her figure back.
Finally, a gender-neutral restroom.
A predictable outcome after all that jumping about...
I'm sure it's an Edgar Deergas
I think that might be my Dad and me when we were visiting the Ozarks.
I see why he's known for his does.
Yeah, but you should have seen her before she fawned.
I don't know, I guess this series just leaves a gamey taste in my mouth.
It's a little fawning don't you think?
I think the artist captured the innocence of the subjects perfectly.
I like her attitude. Confident! She's not hurrying across the road for anyone.
We are hoping these two will be adopted together.
I'll never understand postmodernism.
These things are reallly going to mess up Christmas Eve.
So ironic, of course-considering the way he died.
This harsh yellow supposedly evokes impending death.
Oh Dear, ...Oh Dear
I like the frame.
I don't care for pornography.
Remember the days when we weren’t trusted behind the wheel?
Mooseum of Modern Art
Nice, but she does come with baggage!
They call this art? Nothing more than trail markers.
It is definitely reminiscent of the mid-20th century Bambi school of realism.
The artist got sentimental in his yellow period.
Actually, I find these exhibits of bathroom door art to be pretty limited.
These memorial walls stop me in my tracks.
Yes, I know it's art but it's still reckless to depict her coaxing the fawn across the headlight zone...
Why do they never serve lichen at these events?
And where were you last fall!
Single mother? Still a turn-on.
I think it's exploitive.
What will they paint next...humans on two feet?
Who commissions a portrait like that with a bright yellow background?
No, I get it, I just think Pop Art is lazy
I never cared much for his period of cautionary realism.
Shall we?
This one is called carpool lane.
“Wherever I am I am what is missing.” What the hell does that mean?!?
He painted this from memory as an adult deer. Their last walk together before the hunter got her.
Seems very gender-biased to me.
I prefer Warhol's Cow
I think this was taken in Yosemite.
Did you know this year is the 75th anniversary of that movie?
It ain’t worth two bucks.
The title is 'Walk like an Egyptian' . . .
Hey, you know if the game's on?
Banal, yet endeering.
Bambi’s mother was pretty, but she was no Moose-a Lisa.
The post eco-modernist movement is so real.
I was in a rut
This is a commission the artist did of a Madonna and Child.
Now this one, I'm fawning over!
I prefer post-modern myself
And this is your Grandmother and Uncle Buck.
It just captures my attention like a deer in the headlights.
All I can see is headlights.
The composition seems trite, although it does have a modernist component.
Your late uncle thought these were TVs.
This one dates from 2018--just 50 years before our Revolution.
A caption would be superfluous.
Do I look fat?
Did you remember to turn off the iron?
Yes, he's less abstract now, but this semiotics phase he's in just isn't as interesting.
This one right here, saved my dear Grandfather's life.
I liked his Curve Ahead Arrow better.
I like the artist, but he's a little cautious.
It’s reminescent of cavemen art.
Another not so-great day on I-95.
Since the divorce, this is the only way to see my son.
I don’t know why, but I can’t stop staring at it.
I don't really go for this abstract stuff.
I get the sign but what does it signify?
Yes, I agree, I prefer the MILF over the Mapplethorpes
I know the others are worth more bucks, yet I continue to fawn over this one.
Where's the menace in the message?
Yes, he had no idea that humans would take notice of his work.
In my opinion, this is Kara Walker's best work.
So what do you think it is? Well, Deer, I think it's a sign.
You can really see the lapland influence on the brush strokes.
I really like the intimacy of his "Bambi Period"
I find this exhibit rather pedestrian, don't you?
This was the point where her work broke thematically from the herd.
I just don't get Art. What's That supposed to be?
I noticed there was a trigger warning in the catalogue.
I knew her before she became a famous model.
Oh deer god.
...but there has been no statistical reduction in deaths where this sign was posted.
Isn't that your cousin Terry?
Oh dear, a unisex bathroom would solve this entire problem.
One of these things is not like the others. One of these things doesn't belong.
Yeath, that's pretty good....but remember that headlight exhibit..? I just couldn't look away!
That could have been you but you chose to focus on your career.
Fine, as long as these Cold Cases aren't coming out of my budget.
Wow! That's very daring--two in the same picture!
I commissioned it -- it's my wife and little Timmy.
Yeah - they call it street art, deer.
Frankly, it's what I've come to expect from a van Doe.
My kid could do this.
Are you free for dinner tonight?
Not sure if it's a puzzle or a bathroom sign.
I see a cautionary tale with no tail
These are from his pre-venison period.
I don't quite know why, but there's something foreboding about this gallery.
I like the aesthetic, but somewhat heteronormative, don't you think?
We leap too, you know.
It's so post-less modern.
Ceci n'est pas une deer.
I think these images have been photoshopped
The bucks were disappointed to discover that humans vastly underestimated their role in parenting.
Family pictures tend to make me sad.
A tad too minimalist for my taste.
So they want us to pick just one? I think this would be the most usable emoji...don't you think?
I heard this was one of the last paintings that Bambi’s mother posed for.
Not sure it really captures the situation.
I'm not going wild over it.
I don’t get what this artist is trying to say.
Very limited palette, if you ask me.
Actually, I prefer abstract expressionism.
It represents every time they’ve crossed my mind.
She looked better in stag films.
Marvelous command of pallet.
Why are we reviewing this man-made crap? Shouldn't be we be practicing our ballet?
I was asked to be part of the performance art.
It's a 17th century Dutch merchant deer.
I don't think we'll look good in yellow.
Oh my gosh, a Hoovercraft!
This mode of travel didn't stick around long because it really sucked
He's just making these for the doe.
What do think of this one Dear?
Hall of Deervaluion
Coming into the wrong room with antlers could cause a big stink.
I think it's a rather becoming picture of little George.
I don't really know if I'd classify it as still life.
When it comes to reproduction those damn does get all the credit.
This is SO photoshopped.
Who gives a hoof!
His earlier works, before he saw the Bambi film, were superior.
Family album.
Now that's a DILF!
I don't know, Brad. I think they're a little derivative.
One day, you too may be the subject of a traffic sign.
I think the fawn resembles you more than me.
I realize we are colorblind, but why just silhouettes?
You won’t catch me staring into headlights.
Fine painterly qualities - yes, but what a dumb title - 'Expect Deer on our Roads'
I don't know, the art seems a bit cautious to me.
All in all, she was a good president. Too bad she couldn't pass nationwide unlimited roaming bill.
I like it, but it feels a little derivative.
And this painting here shows a classic Renaissance subject matter, Madeerna and Child.
I find it derivative
That reminds me...I should give Claire a call.
Remember when we looked like that..
Clearly, the buck stopped there!
I don't know much about art, but I know what I like.
I never could understand these Impressionists, and frankly, I would rather be destroying someone's garden.
A bit reductive, if you ask me.
But where's the Dad? There's so much left unsaid...
Moving, isn't it, dear?
I was in a rut- then I met your mom.
What makes them think we're going to show up here?
Is every artist required to do a Madonna and Child painting?
While the yellow background is not unique, the juxtaposition and sense of motion of Bambi and his mother is very well achieved.
No wonder the humans are extinct and we're still here
He does amazing work with a limited palette.
Be a deer and get over it.
Frankly, art from primitive cultures just doesn't speak to me.
It's from his sentimentalist period.
This one is your best work as it captures the serenity of the family.
Definitely a MILF
Son, look here... this was taken when you were younger we were in the city.
Man, this is so sexist! I often walk the fawns across the road, too, you know.
The taxidermy exhibition was a lot more realistic, if you ask me.
Don't look at the ceiling. You will stare at those lights forever!
How pedestrian!
She looks exactly like my first wife.
Is that your missus and my kid?
- William White-Tail "self portraits" c.1978-1986
Obviously, from his post-romantic period" OR "It's sad. In her later years, she'd do anything for a buck.
I'm not impressed -- a fawn could paint that.
If you look closely you'll notice a subtle transition from impressionism to symbolism.
Hell, my fawn could've painted this one.
Humans see us as so one dimensional.
No, dear, I was not his muse.
I have been paying child support since we got together.
A buck says you can't guess the artist.
It's called "Doe and Fawn Lives Matter."
I think that takes care of us, but what about The Three Bears?
I remember when they did this one. You were 8-months old and really adorable.
We've come a long way since we defeated the apes who defeated the humans.
That's one hot mama.
That was before the hyperloop
Don't know if he was trying for PopArt or Dadaism, but either way this will be worth a lot more money after he gets hit by a truck.
Feminist art.
Oh, deer, What can the Matter Be?
Why do they keep on painting us all into that same old, tight corner... always yellow and black! Might we look like bees or bananas to them?
They love their bipedalism and opposable thumbs, but I'm sure grateful for the evolution of human Musk.
That's you with your Mom . . . the last picture of her, taken just before she was hit by a truck.
This is quite a departure from all those damn dangerous installations right on top of those busy roads.
Piet Mondrian meets Sir Edwin Landseer
It should sell for a lot of dough.
I believe these are all from the artist's Art Deerco period.
Cute, but not super cute.
Unfortunately, they read it backward and went in the opposite direction.
I remember them when they were nobody ....
Humans are an endangered species
I, for one, have little nostalgia for the days when the humans still ruled.
I've seen better street art
That one was taken at the school crossing
Well, it's better than last month's roadkill exhibit.
I believe the artist is conveying how passive we are to the monsters with the glowing demon eyes!
Oh, well, I could have done this.
How endeering.
Here we see a visual pun on intersectionality.
Those White Tails all look alike, to me.
Do I really look like that?
I call it 'Doe and Fawn in Repose'.
His later works emphasize much more of a "road kill" perspective.
These don't help the deers that are slaughtered in traffic, but the artistry cannot be denied.
Reproducing is clearly deadly...
It's a brave statement on the state of the nuclear family.
It's not just the prices that are highway robbery.
He's been on one hell of a journey
This is a bad sign for the future of art.
Pictures are worth a thousand words!
It's the earliest known depiction of Bambi.
His work is too derivative.
Yes, most definitely Post-Audubon.
I see this as a sign that you still need to get your game on.
Where's the headlights ?
Deer are known for their ability to browse.
I see despair and longing, it's very moving. A single mother and her fawn. The dewy morning meadow. 18 wheels.
Iconic Warhol.
It's the last picture of them together. Poor deer didn't see it coming.
Obviously what he lacks in visual depth is overcome by his use of... yellow.
I find the utilitarian nature of his work both inspiring and terrifying.
A little too sentimental for my taste.
You should see his body of work during the "deer in the headlights" period.
If I'm not mistaken, these are deer prints.
I find this work menacing yet playful because of the way the reductive quality of the figurative-narrative line-space matrix notates the larger carcass.
They look just like the ones we saw when we crossed the highway to get here.
MIDDLE DEERE( I have never really enjoyed family portraits.) FAR RIGHT DEERE(That's why you will never get a woman Mike.)
That was me as a fawn.
Seems to be in a bit of a rut.
But what does it mean?
Very contemporary.
This piece truly captures the essence of mother-fawn bonding.
Of course it's all the same, he’s in a rut!
“ I like it but why is it titled “ Headlites” ?
Now remember: when training humans, always include a reference to Bambi.
Huh... and I usually detest Jeff Rakoons.
It's about time someone thought of the children.
The imagery...the lights...I'm having a deja vu moment, Rick.
Reminds me, have you heard the one about the deer crossing the road?
Only the ones with rack move me.
Death, yes. But does it really capture that 'Bambi and his mother' vibe?
It's quite an interesting juxtaposition.
It's all so sanitized.
I’ve never been a fan of primitive art.
At a party I'd ask 'em if they were sisters. Works every time.
Don't tell me those are supposed to be deer?
I just love the Old Masters!
Long ago moms taught their sons to "take a knee"; yet, still we are hunted.
I like the Planned Parenthood version.
I prefer his mauve period.
This one here is part of my earlier work
It's a still life from childhood... that's Mom on the right.
There's a certain 'sameness' to his work that bores me.
I'd like it more if they were jumping.
It's from his 'crossing' period.
I'd kill for those legs.
And yet, we were the ones who were crossed.
I keep getting older, but she stays the same age.
The artist flourished after the Roadkill Period.
I find his work entirely too self-referential.
Modern art is too stark for my taste.
Despite countless marches by the Does, it took the release of the animated film Bambi for this sign to be introduced.
Ah, a trip down Memory Lane.
These are well done but I'm getting weary of the silhouette on tilted yellow square motif.
I find this one cloying.
I think you will definitely stop traffic!
I prefer his pre-headlight phase.
It Was Just A Shot In The Dark.
Well, as you know, any art is more enjoyable when your wife and son haven't just been killed by a car, Dean.
These are all from his early period...before we walked on two legs.
Yes but what does it MEAN....
Ah, yes! A unique piece. "The Challenges of the Unwed Mother"
It's just so hard to believe. It sounds like something from a movie.
I see no carnage. Where's the realism?
Someone made a lot of doe out of this.
The juxtaposition of man versus deer is compelling
That's a kill.
You know, I was in Italy last week and I'm just tired of looking at Mother and Bambino pictures.
I named this piece Racial Profiling #4
It’s staggering how way too deerivative this is.
'I'm just saying it's a sexist representation. Jumping bucks and doting does. Hell I'm a house buck.'
I painted this during my Cubist period.
he was much better at portraits, but the impressionism is good.
These images are everywhere. It's just so Deer-ivative.
Alas, poor Bambi, I knew you well.
Well, it's clearly post-partem.
It just doesn't say deer to me
A bit maudlin, but I see where the artist is going with it.
Isn't it so meta that we're left our families tonight to come to "The Absent Buck" exhibit?
"Doe, a deer, a female deer..." Those lyrics are just a sign of our times.
I's tragic that we have been reduced to signage.
I preferred her in her fauvism period.
Bah! My kid could've done that.
It is named "Madoena and Child".
This is pure filth.
I don't like it. I look fat.
I caught his show at the venison biennale.
A very modern take on the Madonna with child
Jane Doe never looked better!
The more abstract, the better - to confuse and slow down a self-driving car!
That’s my dear/deer family.
It's okay for figurative work, but I prefer landscapes.
Ah, a modern Pieta. Doe and Fawn.
Now cars are the least of our worries.
Somehow this one just doesn't move me the way the others do.
This one does seem to buck the trend.
It's the headlighting that really freezes them in the moment.
My life's work -- and I still couldn't quite capture the frailty of life.
I think it is too didactic.
I'm not really a fawn of this one.
Such a keen sense of form and direction, you've really pulled it off Phil.
These self portraits leave much to be desired.
I was there too. But the artist only drew you and Junior.
Was I a cute fawn, or what?
Tomorrow’s road kill.
Irony in art 101. They save us to shoot us.
I'll say it again Joe. It's wonderful to see Joanne and flower commemorated for their ability to dodge cars.
I'll bet this one is worth some doe.
His mid-career work displays a more refined sensibility, don't you think?
None of these captions are any good.
The dough they paid for this piece is staggering!
The light on the picture just stops me in my tracks.
While it captures certain family values, I feel it is overly sentimental and deriviative.
Wow, they lived in such an austere manner back then
I just don’t get it
How much are you selling this piece for?" "It will only cost you a buck.
Her work lacks subtlety.
Interestingly, ever since we've collected the items for this exhibition the deer population has mysteriously fallen.
Should we really be standing here?
It’s an ambient painting, you’re not meant to study the brushstrokes.
I don't like to cross in their designated crossing zones, just call me quirky.
These colors just won't work, do you have one in Mikado or Fulvous?
Notice how removing the books (and changing mammals) transforms the old "school crossing" portrait into this "animal crossing"?? - books make all the difference in the world!
His "Ma-doe-na with Bambi-no" is unique among his works.
Transfixing
Doe: A Deer.
let's buy one of these for the road in the gift shop
This one offers more of a "Family" theme. Yet Caution is still key!
Prancer, you keep fawning over the does.
There's a fine line between art and pornography.
'Madonna and Child:' exquisite!
The artist is known only by his initials, D.P.W.
You shouldn't make fun of the deer without antlers -- they're born that way.
I prefer Roy Lichtenstein
Oh, yeah, I remember that freaky little Rudolph. What ever happened to him, anyway?
This is from the Dear In Headlights period.
Pops was right. No matter how safe you may feel. Always look both ways before you cross the street.
I just love the way the artist captured our realism......
Predatory, but caring.
It's called 'Mating Season.' Not very creative.
I love watching myself - I really do have beautiful form
I dunno . . . I'm not really into hyperrealism.
Unrealistic! Fawn startled but doe not? Never happens.
I like it, but it's not hart.
It's like looking at a Vermeer, don't you think?
A late human era Madonna and Child apparently, Gloria.
I call it my "Deers in the Headlights." collection.
If you're right about Intelligent Design, why the antlers?
I’ve never been a fan of the Realists ...
Deer in the spotlights
I know, I know--you _never_ want to see Afternoon of the Fawn. Well, this time it's my way or the highway!
This artist clearly has never seen the rear of a doe.
I've seen this artist's work before! It's a shame it isn't noticed by humans.
Is it politically incorrect to find her attractive?
This is worth $50 million?
Everyone is fawning over these buck naked paintings.
What's this supposed to mean -- go slow for the doe?
'Doe with fawn' is a bit of a cliche, don't you think?
Hon, turn the headlights off so we can go home!
Call me crazy, but I’m just not a fan of Sven’s Yellow Period.
I wonder where he gets his inspiration.
Fauvist?! I resent the implication!
This is one of her earlier works -- note the lack of motion and detail.
Derivative! I prefer his earlier work.
It just doesn't mean anything to me.
The panel on the right is deer crossing in. The panel on the left is deer crossing out. The panel in the center is the well known, The Buck Stops Here.
The light contrast is interesting, but don't you think they could have picked a more flattering angle?
Your mother was murdered with the big bang bang.
Of all our street artists, I never thought he'd sell out.
Of course, women and children get center stage!
Did you sign a release?
Always a doe, never a buck. Politically correct bulls**t.
A staggering exhibit!
I think this one's the restroom for Bucks, Dad.
These two taught me I can't make my life hell all by myself.
Isn't evolution marvelous?
Provocative, yes, but still not an appeal to the prurient interest.
Modern art is so endeering
So, they're going all in with teaching the controversy huh?
Ohs great, a roadside reminder of my failed third marriage.
I really admire his sense of abstract realism...
I wasn't even a year old. Had to pose all day for the artist.
Too much baggage.
I remember when this was taken. I was cute back then!
The contrast is remarkable.
But, what does the diamond symbolize?
This one is of my son, my 45th offspring by my 12th wife.
If we slip out now, Steve will be the one that crosses the street when the driver think it's all clear.
Pssst. Get out the red circle sticker.
It's always worth more once they're venison.
He's definitely not mine.
The color scheme is all wrong.
Ever since this modeling gig, she won't give me the time of day.
These Early Anthropocene displays are rudimentary. Wouldn't you agree?
Inclusive, yes. But would the impact be the same?
That's Shirley and Little Zack and the other two are me in full flight mode.. some rack, huh?
Cute, but pedestrian.
The artist's use of shadow represents the impeding danger that will eventually strike us down.
Ah, the quaintly maternal ‘Baby on Board’ appeal.
They tell me we are paying a price for standing upright.
You call this ART?
YOU'RE RIGHT, SHE DOES LOOK FAT
It’s somewhat repetitive.
Either you love this one or you noticed the overhead lights again.
How nice it would be to move out of the city.
Should I be worried?
I find it maudlin.
I REALLY LIKE IT BECAUSE IT IT GIVES SUCH A NICE FAMILY FEEL.
Why don't they put these up where there is less traffic
Hipsters call this one DoeMa.
If it works, great, but I think its sexist.
This is the first known image of the Leaping Stag.
The bigger the rack the better the results.
Yes, Bambi, I believe this was taken just before that unpleasant event.
This portrait of Bambi with his Mom gets me every time
Let's hope their probe is a newer model.
Oh deer how primitive.
Note the use of shading.
This was painted shortly before my mommy was hit by an suv.
That's a good picture of Bambi, God rest her soul.
The ceiling headlights add a calming, somewhat ethereal, luminescence -don't you agree?
The picture is nice, but the lighting is stunning.
My life and memories on the road have been captured perfectly in these signs.
You look slimmer under light emitting diodes.
I have to piss.
I'm looking forward to family life after all those years of jumping.
This one makes me really horny.
Note the plasticity.
Caution! Deer sighting ahead
Pithy perhaps, but for me, his work demands acquiescence.
I hate abstract art.
I preferred his "circle-backslash" red period
I'd rather be tied to a sleigh.
I just don't understand how folks can fawn over the artist of this Jane Doe and her young just walking.
Does this sign make me look fat?
I call it How Do They Know Where to Cross?
Such deer in the headlights.
Three days after we removed the sign, our lead anthropologist was hit by a car. Sometimes I think the whole project was cursed from the start.
This one is a metaphysical harbinger; a sign, if you will.
I fawn over this one
I wouldn't pay two bucks for this.
No buck—I knew she'd drag gender into it!
I don't know, it seems like this one kinda encourages hunting.
I've always wanted a fawn. How about you?
I didn’t get ant residuals either.
How'd they know that we'd be here?
Please. My kid could have done that.
They saw that van go.
We wil avenge you our dearies.
We divorced after my wife ran off with the artist.
The symbolism is compelling!
...deer God, I love it!
It's not art. My fawn could do that.
I’d comment on the artist's striking juxtaposition of yellow and black, but I’m colorblind.
Has it said anything to you yet?
I have never seen anything like it
This is what happens when you don't use protection.
This isn't art; a fawn could draw these.
Nice rendering, but rather monochromatic.
Oh deer, this exebition is crossing all kinds of lines
I'm sure that's one of mine.
Dad? Oh, he had to cross at the leaping stag sign.
The perspective on this one is perfect!
The other paintings are interesting, but this one truly has heart.
Being hit by an SUV was the start of his black and blue period.
I feel they're all a bit contrived.
The proportions are all wrong.
If only they’d listened to him.
That's the last picture I have of Bambi and his mother.
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery!
It's not your typical Modeergliani
I drew this from memory.
Doe and fawn. How droll.
I recognize this movement.
I’ve never understood why humans thinks we can’t stand.
Trust the women to wangle the biggest wall.
I must say it's rather pedestrian.
One planet’s trash is another planet's treasure.
Say what you will. It's still just social engineering, and I'm 'agin it.
He was the go-to child star, but then he grew up and became just another member of the herd.
It's rumored that she was also his long time muse.
I can't believe these go for such big bucks.
She's the one who double crossed me.
I so long for an Artist with depth.
The name of the exhibit is ENDEERING!
I find the mère et enfant works utterly captivating.
I can appreciate abstract art. Not my favorite, doe.
"Post Realism".
What is it?, you say... Looks like a car crash about to happen.
"Look like Jim?" No, I really don't think so.
Is the lack of imagination ironic?
That was his early road kill period.
Do you get it??
Seriously, I could do that!
I like these much more than his "Road Kill" period.
While I'm engaged by the show overall, this one is way too "Bambi."
I think this one's been Photoshopped.
Look how adorable I was before Mom bought the farm.
Yes, I remember rut well.
He should be behind me
So reductive. A sign of the times, I guess.
Hey Bob isn't that you wife Dora and your kid? I never knew she was a Deer Crossing sign centerfold.
That's way too conceptual for me, I prefer the realism of trophies.
Dou's work always speaks to me on such a primordial level.
I mean I just don't think it's an accurate representation of our true culture
The brutal honesty of his yellow period has a nostalgic charm.
It's not the yellow. It's all the colours he's NOT using.
Looks like an escaped "USDA Farm Raised" even-toed ungulate!
They call everything art these days
I can see what the artist is after, but still don't think they are very lifelike at all.
now this would make a lovely family holiday card!
It's better than a "baby on board" sign
I find representations of unclothed does really disgusting - except during rutting season, of course.
This whole collection is deer-ivitive.
It's worth more because the artist is dead.
I say if you've got a message send a telegram.
Yes, I remember these. But I just love playing with the self-driving ones now!
Why not a man with a gun?
Not a big Andy Warhol fan.
Not as transfixing as last year's light exhibit.
His late life cut outs so remind me of Matisse.
Ah, yes. The tragedy of county road 720. One of my favorite representations.
There is a family resemblance on your mother's side.
It's the unrealistic body images I don't understand.
Too much information.
Looks like the bucks stop here.
I don't know, I find it a bit derivative.
Silhouettes can't really capture emotion.
Deerwinism Exhibit
Her prancing days are over.
Photoshop! Advertisers breeding insecurity. You’re perfect just the way you are??
I think that's Marsha and her fawn.
Here it is - 'Madonna and Child'.
I prefer abstract art myself
I love the use of color here, it really helps create that 'deer in the headlights' feeling
I guess it’s an abstract.
I don't know...these are all a little too safe for my taste.
The the mother-daughter dynamic in this one really makes me emotional.
This show is so derivative.
I love how the light bounces.
On the frontlines, everyone walks on all fours to increase the chances that they'll get hit by moving vehicles.
" Back then they assumed we were Bambi-like and we needed protecting.
I like how he used the black on yellow for this one
Humans, prior to their extinction, worshipped deer and erected entire roadways spanning entire continents to us.
Ama-xing work, don't you think?
Let's go see the human gun rack exhibit next.
Nice to see a little deer in the floodlights.
Relax, we offer paternity testing.
Wow. They faced such perils, all so our generation might have a chance at a better life.
These pieces were inevitable after his haystacks era.
Can't I just go to a Sunday opening to escape my hectic work week and enjoy art without having to see some maternal feminist protest?
True, all signs indicate Mondrian's influence from early on. Clearly. But I've got two bucks that say he also crossed paths with Rockwell.
What a shot!
I'm still paying child support.
At least we don't have to use these for bathrooms anymore.
The statement is hanging them at this angle.
Yet, it's still missing that certain mise en scene.
"Near and Far Away" still leaves room for interpretation, don't you think?
This one was shot with headlights.
Personally, I find it lacking in depth and imagination.
It's from his 'family values' period.
Choose a door already!
Is it art or pornography?
The artist really makes you reflect.
This one is so dear to me..
...and here, with the absence of the father, the artist is clearly commenting on how society makes assumptions about gender roles. Marvelous! Simply Marvelous!!!
Without sentimentality, the doe's fierce will to survive and protect her fawn is made real and palpable by the artist's unhindered and obvious use of colors.
I liked his squirrel period better.
You know, from "Hamlet," "to hold as 'twere the mirror up to nature."
This old Bambi-mother trope somehow works.
It's standard operating procedure for every Madonna to show the son of God as a product of their culture.
Don't you love the bold brush strokes on these two, dear?
I just feel like she's lost touch with her audience.
You can definitely see that we evolved from Australopithecus Deerasaurus
The glare of the yellow hides her true beauty......
I say he looks like you.
Deerchamp has done it again
Is this supposed to be representational?
I'm sorry but it looks nothing like aunt Martha.
Primitive, woodsy and unspectacular. Pre-Disney, I should think.
Ever notice they don't demand equal representation on the trophy room wall?
Why can't they just build a wall?
I call it: “Portrait of the Artist as a Young Fawn”
'It's all disappointingly deer-ivative.'
I like this one. It gives a little something extra.
It emotes a cautionary tale.
How about one for the guys.
The illumination is okay, but it’s not quite the effect produced by headlights.
I guess I just don’t get Modern Art.
Do these lights seem harsh?
Sure. Bambi, pathos. I get it. But is it art?
She use to complain about every time she met a buck, they seemed to be in a rut. Seems like she realized that wasn't such a bad thing.
She said she was on the pill.
I thought the stag party would be more fun.
reflections
Exceptionally bold use of color!
My favorite "Madoena & Child."
That's me and Junior just before we got caught in those damn headlights.
Meh. Abstract art never does anything for me.
School-Bus Yellow isn't my best color.
Startling! Or maybe that's just the lights.
Freeze in place...or Run? ??
Antlers are overrated.
Ah yes. Vincent van Doe.
I really enjoy her Primitive Period
Son, see this is what can happen!
I see these as less reflective and contemplative when compared with the overt symbolism of his orange period.
Oh, my! It's so life-like, don't you think?
His work has become redundant since he moved to Pennsylvania.
Hmmm, I guess this was from when he was in his romantic era.
What a shame; a breakdown in the nuclear family.
Don't you like the en plein air spirit?
Reality Therapy as Art
This is called "The buck stops here"
Remember when all we had to worry about was forest fires?
Like a deer caught in the recessed lights.
Frankly, I'm not getting it. It lacks the joie de vivre of his "In the Headlights" series. This is much too derivative.
I guess it means something to somebody!
Honey, I don't think we can afford it. I think this painting is going to be very dear!
I'm all for abstract art but this is just off-the-charts crazy!
Staggering!
I find it to be a bit derivative.
It's been all downhill since his return to figuration.
Looks a little bit like my Aunt Edna
A thousand bucks for this?
Can you believe what she's wearing?!
Familial, yes. But it lacks the energy of his other works.
I’m partial to this one, the Madoe and Child.
I think she found herself in this work.
I remember her - the urine scent was fantastic.
So heteronormative.
"I'm passing the buck. It's definitely not mine. This rutting thing is just too taxing for an old forester like me.
Your dear mother always fawned over you.
I take it as a warning.
What fo you mean “nice composition”? My eyes want to move right off the image.
Now I don't have to go stag.
Gosh, dear, don't you feel like we've met them on the road, or was it at our mountain place?
I wonder where the young one migrated to.
Andy Warhol meets Bob Ross.
The Welfare Deer
Madonna and child. A classic combination.
I have some recollections of the grandpas tellings about walking like theses two.
She was his second wife.
Antler Adams Photography Exhibit. Admission: 2 bucks.
The fawn hearkens me to the rampant promiscuity of the natural world.
This is some of Bambi Warhol's finest work.
Life certainly looked more fun then.
Oh look, another Mary and Baby Jesus. I told you, these old paintings bore me to death.
It's kind of uncanny, almost like it wasn't meant for us.
I call this "Deer in the Spotlight"
Look at how young we were.
This piece perfectly illustrates what a dark period this was in the artist's life.
I remember when your mom took you in here.
When she ran away with the artist she took the kid.
I get the whole "exhibition theme " idea. But having to wear these suits is taking it a bit far. Don't you think?
The artist seems to capture the essence of her subject every time.
It's a bit derivative, wouldn't you agree?
But what does it say to YOU?
This one makes us look so conventional.
My six week old fawn can paint better than that.
Of course you would like that one best, you're always horny!
Come to think about it. If we never stood up, we'd be extinct.
Now I know what Does mean when they complain about "haunch idealization."
A cautionary tale...
So, this must have been before the fire.
The painting shows a contrast of light and dark colors. The artist creates an emotional mood and space, having the Mother follow her doe protectively. There are no real lines in the painting because it is painted in a pointilist style.
Reminiscent of their earlier work, however the new reflective element is quite exciting, don't you think?
This is a nice retrospective
They're endearing.
It's from his Doe Period
Once again he's taking the safe route.
They don't seem to have progressed much since the Mesolithic period.
Look at them , like deer in the headlights.
Something's off. Ten bucks it's a forgery.
I don't understand what passes for art these days.
Call me old-fashioned, Larry, but I like art to say something.
It just doesn't mean anything to me.
Oh yeah... I like this one. You can really feel the emotion
I find them pedestrian
Okay I get. You're saying there'd be a controversy if there was nothing controversial.
My calf with amnesia could have done that.
A little doe always helps you move forward.
Look. Think. Jump
This collection reminds me of that cave painting exhibit we saw last month.
I'll always have this one to remember them by.
You mean Uncle Mort didn't have to deal with chronic back pain?
The DOT has really taken road art to the next level with this one
Clearly a counter-pro-test to Dadaism.
And I say it's just another example of the feminization of our culture.
Maybe they won't shoot at this one.
She wasn't cautious enough.
I find his work too derivative
I find this art form to be way too "2 Dimensional"! Don't you?
It was a moment of unbridled passion...
It's a nice museum, but the traffic here was murder.
Are you sure Ancestry.com is accurate?
I may not know art...
Here’s an example of my earlier work.
Provocative yet sincere
A staggering display of modern art.
This one's called "Peter and Jane Fawn-Doe."
The artist exquisitely captures the tender moment right before the vehicle strikes.
Were there trigger warnings when you were in art school?
I knew the artist. Wonderful talent. Then a truck ran him over.
I’d enjoy this exhibit so much more, if I didn’t have to jump through a plate glass window, to see it.
The irony is I had to shoot her with a strobe.
I like it, but is it art?
To me, this piece says, "Buck Off."
I find the nativities particularly moving.
It's good, but misses our true essence!
I find it just so ... Bambi.
"He obviously did not have hindsight".
This one is of….no eyed deer.
It's missing the headlights.
Heads up boys.
Apparently pre-planet of the apes roadside art.
Is there someone already in there? No. I just couldn't work out how to open the door with these hooves.
That's just too dear.
These domestic portraits are so banal.
Raindeer art by Rudolph, how contrived!
So expensive. I should have bought one of these before the artist ran in front of that SUV.
I just LOVE how this piece bucks convention.
The artist perfectly captures society's heteronormative and patriarchal views of parenthood.
Whose initials are DPW?
See, they liked racks bigger back then.
So you think it's all about money. More dough for the does?
I told him: 'You need dimension, detail.' But, no. Just silhouettes, that's all he would ever paint.
It's a sobering reminder we're all at risk.
The title on this one is "Future Road Kill"
Fabulous colors and form! It really speaks to me. Great investment!!
This was a sign of the times back then, before we learned to stand up for ourselves.
These two are famous for abolishing those trickery deer crossing signs. It's my all time favorite painting by Venison Van Goeh.
The artist will make a million bucks.
His work is very political since the Crash.
Never did get pain for that modeling job!
The artist has masterfully captured the essential nature of the cervine condition.
Look for the light before you leap.
A Dadaist gallery I know sells such pieces for half the price.
I prefer the works of Lascaux.
I wonder how Pollack would have painted it
Voilà, another masterpiece! Rudolph the roadside-sign artist, you’ll go down in history!
apparently they don't require ties or horns
I can't say I see anything original here, Buck.
I feel like I've seen this one somewhere before.
For me it evokes fond memories of my childhood.
Funny thing is...I personally can't stand looking at pictures of raindeer...but that's just me
Keeping the fawn still that long was a challenge.
These impressionists don't really capture the essence of our species.
When she won custody, that hurt badly enough. Now she's gotta throw it in my FACE?
I appreciate the artists view on feminism.
I suppose it's not as degrading as having your picture in every post office.
A bit tame.
This is a crossing of Symbolism and Feminism.
I'm more of a 'deer caught in headlights' aficionado.
It's so...feminist.
Can't buck the trend.
It's always fascinating to see how different cultures memorialize our dead.
Becky they messed up my butt...AGAIN!!
My cousin Bambi with my aunt. The artist really captured the pre-angst, even though they're in profile. Residuals are still stuck in Probate...
I prefer his cariblue period.
The buck stop is here.
This painting must be worth a lot of doe
This one reveals the Angst of his post-modern period.
So... who's your Daddy?
I prefer Walt Disney.
Interesting abstract mother and child portrait.
Hmm, 2 bucks...is about what I would pay for something like this.
These were called "yield signs" in the pre-Trump era. At the time, the NRA was getting it's way only about 98 percent of the time.
I'm just not attracted to a doe after she's given birth.
Did you know that she was pregnant?
I can see why this artist has made so many bucks.
I think I prefer the roundabout series.
I find I am partial to Rockwell.
Why don't they just ban cars?
Not the best likeness of your wife and kid.
She always put Junior first.
This is from his 2D phase. So primitive but powerful.
It’s a good likeness of Millicent and her daughter but black doesn’t do her justice.
She really captures what it's like to be us.
"This one is titled 'Deer With A Pearl Earring'".
It started in their caves.
Unoriginal Sexist?
They look like people caught in the headlights.
I tell you, she bares a striking resemblance to Bambi.
See, just like we saw in the wild.
I've never really been a fan of modern art.
This entire collection only cost me a few Bucks
My girlfriend was invited, but I decided to come stag.
So lame, eh?
..... and that's what happened when the buck crossed the road.
They call this art? Please.
I understand that the artist is known as the "Painter of Signs." I'll admit that the work has a certain Anti-Borgesian appeal, however the artist has become as over exposed as Thomas Kincaide, "Painter of Light."
My Aunt Sadie and cousin Buck never liked Dodges.
Art Muriel. ART!!! I've seen better on the side of the road.
When did wayfinding become art?
Here comes another sucking drone!
He's into primitivism, but he does capture our essence.
17,000 years since Lascaux and they call this gender equality?
I ruminate about your mother and what might have been.
I thought he did humans too!
I just don't get late twentieth-century warningism. Where's the emotion?
They all walk on four legs!
Ah prewar...and in exellent condition
A tad derivative, don't you think?
Wow that is vintage!
Splendid job of depicting the carefree days of the pre-Santa Claus era!
And here’s Oedipus in his formative years...
I just don't get this modern art.
It says beware of being killed by something you don’t know the plural of.
Unbelievable! Like she's ever crossed a highway.
Yes, the style is vivid, but the theme is a bit derivative.
You've edited me out of your life?
I prefer his later self-portraits, specifically those from after the truck hit him.
You call this a portrait gallery? Doesn't resemble anyone in our herd.
He's mine. He looks like my Uncle Herb.
I think he’s captured the essence of the situation while staying true to the perspicacity of the genre.
It's just another form of cultural appropriation.
I don't know...it's just so revisionist...isn't it?
Quite endearing, aren’t they?
"Walk" they said. That's how they got poor Estelle and little Edward.
They used to display these publicly but felt they were under-appreciated.
In profile, her butt becomes Kardashian.
You never warned me when you went off birth control.
The nativities I find particularly moving.
Yes, but you didn't do it.
This would look great in the den
Why are we always depicted in tilted mustard jars?
So I said, "Bambi, be a dear..."
His stuff was great before he had the family.
So banal! It would be aesthetically preferable for the obvious maternal bond to be expressed in the abstract rather then representationally.
He's doing for deer what Hopper did for people
Have you gone to the moose wing yet?
I don't expect every piece to be groundbreaking but some art is too pedestrian.
That be Bambi. I'm his Pa.
It's pretty good for street art.
I agree while derivative, this work manages to surpass the original in capturing what is the cervine condition.
Current exhibit: "Deer in the overhead lights."
Oh deer me! These should be human being warnings!
When I was young, I was quite the rebel. I never crossed where they wanted me to.
Poor thing. She did not know it was a doe permit hunting season.
A POIGNANT STATEMENT OF THE EFFECT OF A FATHERLESS HOME. NOTICE THE TAUL TUCKED IN SHAME. (I'M NOT THAT FAT! I'M NOT THAT FAT! WHY DID HE MAKE ME LOOK SO FAT!)
You know, I think this may be my great great great grand deer.
Wish I had seen this one before the divorce.
They used to call it road kill before autonomous cars took over.
It's nice to take the time to appreciate his work. I'm usually just bounding by.
Yellow, why yellow?
A true representation of minimalism.
I'd like to add you to my professional network on LinkedIn
I like this one deerly!
I bet you three bucks says they find it shallow and one directional.
It kind of looks like me.
I told you they'd be back if you didn't stop barking!
Really makes you stop and think.
I always said Martha would become a famous model.
This free museum pass has been great for keeping kids out of trouble after school.
I agree, the exhibit is quite endeering.
Did you just swipe right?
I'm voting for the middle one because it's most like my family.
My faun could do that.
Sigh! Deer today, gone tomorrow!
I guess I can chalk this up as a win after losing out on both John Deere and Hartford Insurance gigs.
My little Bambi could have done that!
Feminism is everywhere!
A bit maudlin for my taste.
Well, it's certainly different.
They are 'deer-ivitive' and I have seen many like them on the NY Thruway.
I never feel comfortable choosing between states' rights and an historically constructed, oppressive paradigm.
I could have done this with my phone.
What's your interpretation?
Typical deer under headlights
Unfortunately, this was a still life.
The pictures from my black and yellow camera are not as good.
Santa would be proud.
Ironic how these are all caught in the spotlights.
It is part of the new feminist movement.
Personally, I like to see more XING.
That's it: one more Madonna and child or resurrection motif and I'm ramming it to smithereens!
hmmm they look so dumb...
That is so sexist. Not all female deers choose to have babies...The humans are getting gender neutral restrooms.
I prefer this realism exhibit much more than abstraction one from last month
Weird choice for a stag night, don't you think?
A bit too erotic for my tastes.
I should've listened to that trigger warning.
Not a good sign when we're left out of family portraits.
and they drove the motorists to extinction , shame
His masterpiece is called "Deer In the Headlights," but it doesn't appear to be part of this exhibit.
how is this any different than pornography
Mama told me to be careful when we crossed the road.
I think his work is vastly overrated.
These were taken just moments before his death.
I'm sorry, my kid could do better.
Affecting, yes ... but so derivative.
High beams are rough on kids.
You and the kid. This one always pass the buck.
"Crossing the Delaware." I just can't stop staring at it.
Seems litter-al to me.
I don't like it. It gets me in a rut.
It's quite pleasing if you lack cones.
We used to live in forests, son—but you weren't born yet.
Okay? But show me what to use for birth control?
Do you think the background makes me look fat?
Including the fawn was damned clever. Otherwise, I'd say it's a bit risqué.
I feek the artist accurately captures the existential tension involved with crossing the road.
Why can't we have a sign that says soft shoulder?
Art is in the eye of the beholdeer.
Oh my! Deer allover the walls....
He calls it "Deer in the Headlights".
I don’t think it’s truly reflective of reality.
Can't believe they used to live in the WILD!
A bit cautious on the perspective...
The real mystery is how they knew where to cross.
Dear dear dear dear dear - this isn’t art!
His watercolors are better.
It's their second amendment right.
Clearly, this is a traveling exhibit.
Equal suffrage, my foot!
I'd like to put in an offer, but it's deer.
This artwork is so derivative.
She's definitely got your deer-in-the-headlights look.
Dear deer.
Special Exhibit: Homage to Roadkill Before the Era of Self-driving Deer
They had to stay absolutely still for this piece.
It's a sign of the times.
What is it really trying to say?
So life like. Much better than all those serigraphs around town.
I hear the Bambi collection was bought out by Smokey the Bear.
Looking forward to the Whitetail Biennial.
No!!! Wait! I'll go back and get a baggie!
It's realism is commendable, but I'm troubled by the "othering" rendered by the silhouettes.
It really screams, 'Stand motionless in incoming traffic.'
The humans post in their cars, 'Baby on board.'
'Doe with Faun' was such a radical statement at the time, wasn't it?
The work evokes imminent danger and destruction in contrast to the nostalgic, Bambi-esque depictions of its subjects.
Banksy really outdid himself this time.
Well it's . . . different.
Definitely post-modernism
Wow famous after all these years.
Damn, she was so hot back then.
You know, where the deer and the antelope play.......
Looks like they profiled Helen and Jimmy.
Why yellow?
Be cautious of your crossing from youth to adulthood.
bottom text
Call me old-fashioned, but I still prefer action painting.
This one is just of my wife and little Sally. I saw headlights and baled out.
I find standing like this makes it look like I really know what I'm talking about
His "shadow" technique was brilliant!
These lights don't do their eyes justice.
We should build a wall
"I sometimes long for the good old days, before we had to take over from those idiots called 'mankind'".
Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of Deerchamp.
It's just exploitation, putting a cute young thing in the frame.
Obviously pandering to the crossing moms.
True, this one's worth a lot of dough, but not many bucks.
They charge us twenty-five dollars for tickets and this is what they put up on the walls?
I can't get into this Post-Bambi Op Art.
Don't you think hexagonal STOP signs would be more appropriate?
Oh, deer, What can the Matter Be?
Too much yellow
Undoubtedly "Early Nihilism". Very impressive.
I got one for my house so my ladyfriends think I'm married.
These modernists are a sign of fawning phoniness!
That would look great in my dorm room.
Interesting, yes. But does birthism have any meaning?
The work of Vincent van Doe is truly exquisite.
Don't even start with your "I could have done it" nonsense
She never told me I had a daughter
I thought they said these were from the artist's blue period. What do you think they meant by "blue"?
He's hands down the most important artist of our generation.
A little pedestrian, don't you think?
It's derivative yet sublime.
Genius! The eyes really do follow you around the room.
So deep, so profound, it really speaks to me.
Sorta pushing the envelope on the "familiarity breeds contempt" theme, eh?
Is the artist now dead and famous, or the subject models now dead and famous?
They're all too deerivative for my taste.
We're in the market for trophy art.
I'm thinking a bit too Bambi-ish sentimental perhaps.
Hinky, dinky, par le vous. What do you think?
Too frozen.
I know "Art" when I see and this isn't it.
Primitive.
So why do they want to kill us?
We need one with a picture of a car.
post-war realism at its finest.
It's "Wall Art" by R.Mutt.
Such unrealistic expectations for how we should look.
It's just so deerivative.
This may sound cynical, but I think it's too two dear.
Thank God for driverless cars.
Do they really need the high beams on above?
The rendering is primitive yet powerful. Almost as if they foresaw their extinction at our hands. Er, hooves.
These are all too pedestrian for my tastes.
I think that's mine.
I don't know, my five-year old could have done that.
Frankly, I don't get it. Why not one with a Winnebago?
Seems a little deerivative.
It's titled "Mommy Deerest."
Well, at least that antler chandelier craze is over.
I don't know. . . it just doesn't say "Bambi" to me.
This reminds me of those 'Wild Rainiers' beer ads several years ago.
Hmm.... a cautionary juxtaposition of spatial relationships
Art is gay.
Her talent is so bright you cannot help but stare.
Not a sentimental approach, and her later works are less representational.
Obviously, signpost-impressionism.
Look at the incredible! greys in the background.
I thought we were going to a stag show.
Unflinching bravery, dramatic coloration, and a reminder to rut.
They really crossed the line this time.
I fawned over her for years.
Does not need a caption.
This one is thought to have saved the life of a future 18-point buck.
It's called "Madonna and Child."
I feel trapped inside a buck’s body.
The expression, "like a deer caught in the exhibit lights" only caught on in the most refined circles
We should have stayed with the "Doe-cent" led tour.
Ah, yes. My Ford warned me of this piece from the parking lot.
My fawn could do better than this.
I wish I would have saved our family photo.
Where is the international art section?
I look fat.
If this is modern art, then call me old fashioned, because I'm not fawn of it.
I still don’t see it.
One Day, maybe you’ll be in the Hall of Game...
His use of color is striking!
It doesn't look that abstract to me..
These look EXACTLY like the one outside my thicket
Never play their games, son. Let's go pee in the grass.
I see two headlights coming right at me. What about you, deer?
I don’t care for it. It’s too deer-rivitive.
These exhibitions really take the excitement out of 'street art', don't you think?
Ugh...more doeism. Male, white-tailed deer aren’t represented anywhere anymore.
What is up with this picture? I just don't get it.
If the other two are a buck, this one must be at least two.
I still like the buff.
Another Remington masterpiece. An oil on steel titled "Madonna with Fawn.
Poignant...Lacks urgency...Her butt's too big.
I call this one 'Racial Profiling #17'
I don't mind an adult cervidae selling out, but to force their own fawn to do the same is what disturbs me
No, I'm not buying, it's two deer.
I'm telling you: Bambi, there, totally looks like me!
It's harrowing to see the headlights' perspective
His work went downhill after winning that government grant.
look at the legs on that Doe
Brilliant. Even better than his turtle series.
The artist really gets the emotional bond, don't you think?
It says the artist died only seconds after this was taken.
No, headlights would be derivative
It's cultural appropriation, if you ask me.
The gender stereotypes here are astonishing.
Interesting, yes, though I preferred his work with les Fauves.
His Yellow Period was quite dry.
Alas, she ran off with a horny goat.
What do you think is the hidden message behind this painting?
nice art
Wendy looks good with that yellow background.
Now, this one is very deer.
Too iterative
I dunno ... I think it fails to evoke much emotion
A tad civilian, but better than the mantelpiece I suppose.
Like the artwork, but I wish the overhead illumination wasn't headlights.
Not emoosinal enough for me
Oh, I don't know...it's a bit too abstract for my taste.
No guts no glory
How sweet – Bambi will make them slow down.
This painting always bring me to tears.
Remarkable likeness
Sadly, depictions of dear have not evolved much over the decades.
These were your ancesdeers.
So are the headlights inherent?
His early work is doe-rivative.
But it's not singed.
It's from his early period - before he was nearly hit by a Range Rover.
Bambi's Law made this sign
This is a warning? Yeah, maybe not to eat so many acorns.
It just feels reductive.
He never seems to run out of ideas.
It would appear that the Department of Transportation is finally moving toward gender equality?
The high jump was not Roger's best event.
My favorite painting is titled "Deer Caught in the Headlights".
captures his likeness perfectly
Once they're married, they go to pot.
Do you think we look like deer in the headlights right now?
Why is it always the bucks that leap into traffic?
I still say Bobby could have made this.
I saw one just like this in my neighborhood the last time I crossed the street!
This was taken right after Dad left her for another woman.
No, two DEER! It's an invariant noun!
They grow up much too quickly.
Nowadays, why can't painters paint something ordinary people like us will understand?
The organic symmetry expressed in the most daring flat tones so magically captures the purity of love between the "fawning" mother and " deer" baby.
Actually, I prefer to yield to art.
I Agree, Let's Do It Now
I never did like cubism".
I'd have kept this out of the exhibit - too sentimental.
This artist show is superior to his Picasso’s, In the headlights .
Hate it. But... I'm frozen in those headlights above us.
The lack of detail is a little disappointing.
The lighting is very dark but once they add the headlights it's captivating!
It's a warning about deer's fragility.
It's called hop skip and a jump.
While a fine use of Dynamic Symmetry technique, I'm just not a fawn of this one...
If you stare, the eyes look like headlights.
It brings back my youth in deer old days.
As a Madonna and Child, it's utterly derivative work.
Not only action shots, I do family portraits, too, as you can see here.
'The why always escapes me."
If they're going to be posted as missing, why make them so hard to smell?
Isn’t he just a chip off the ol’ buck
Honey, I think these are signs from the human era.
I think they call this one, "Deer in the Headlights".
These are a bit didactic, don't you think?
My kid could paint that.
I just find his work overly didactic.
Don't be cross with me.
Venison de Milo and little Stew...magnificent
This one makes me horny.
Seriously Agnes, where is the gender equality in this sign?
Only cross the road at these signs!
It makes me feel disempowered.
I find his work pensive, but the gallery's use of headlights riviting
Does the yellow in this sign make their butts look big ?
This venison profiling has to stop.
I just don't think this captures our elegance and grace under pressure from all those speeding cars and trucks.
If the sign was of running deer, they would have made it.
Walking to the death trap
Never been a big still life fan.
This is his post Rudolph period
Derivative though.
I don't know what I like but I know what art is.
Now I know what a Stagnation means!!! Is this what they mean by Stagnation???
I preferred his Blue period.
I see he captured your better side.
So, yes, that was before every doe legally got antlers.
I wouldn't give you a buck for it.
I hate it when these artists try to exploit children.
Why do deer cross the road?
I get a sense of impending doom approaching at 55 mph.
It's a bit primitive.
This newer stuff is too confusing.
There's this sense of inevitability that haunts all of Bambi's Disney Period.
I miss North Carolina.
These were the only ones not destroyed during the Venison Wars.
I heard they pay a lot of money to pose for these signs
I find the work overly sentimental.
Deer Crossing. Nice title...
I've broken out of my Barbasol Phase to challenge the limits of roadside communication. If Bambi doesn't work, nothing will work!
And this one is his earliest work.
When my antlers light up, and my nose turns red, you know I am the real Rudolf.
What does she know that we don't know?
Stag party
As Churchill said, it is “a remarkable example of modern art.”
I love stag nights.
Dear, do this picture make my butt look big?
They all certainly capture our essence.
I often wonder, how much can a work of art reflect life itself?
Feminist propaganda, not art.
"Yours or mine? The buck stops here!" Shelley Rodgers Alexandria, VA
Compared to this one, the other works seem so stag-nant.
This makes us look so conventional.
They treat us like Mexicans ....
It's kind, all right, but it lacks a certain umph!
I can definitely see the Mary Cassatt influence.
Derivative. Paradoxically, her earlier works seem more mature to me.
Too much in the headlights.
More like deer crossed-legs. Haha.
Signs don't really express the true feelings I have.
(No caption necessary.)
Oh Deer, this one is cute.
I like the composition, but it's overexposed.
Well, I'll be darned - that is my Sandra She never told me I was a father...
To me, this one needs more action.
Interesting use of yellow, but I've seen it before.
they really didn't capture my personality.
"Once freeways were built this sign had zero effect.
I don't know how realistic that silhouette effect is, but the bold yellow background is rather mesmerizing.
Your's or mine?
I get it now - these are the latest in the 'deer crossing' signs put out by the humanoids.
He really doesn't know how to draw!
I'm sure with worth more than a couple of bucks!
I find the Squatting Deer series much more moving.
And this one here is an example of what not to do on the road.
Personally, I find them very derivative.
I find The Reflective period rather pedestrian
That's what happens when you cross the street without looking.
Those damn headlights.
I like his "Deer in the Headlights" series better.
Finally, Outsider Art I can finally appreciate.
3 Buck Fridays at The Headlight Museum.
He said it helps him relax from all the noise in the toy shop
This was during his blue period after the custody battle.
She takes you right up to the guardrail and leaves you there, asking yourself, “What are those blinding lights?”
Frankly, I am more into Impressionism.
Such an unfair representation! Every father I know spends way more time with the kids.
Where's its dangus?
Reminds me of deer caught in a spotlight.
Deergital signage...
Splendid! But why alert those four wheeled, horn-tooting monsters of our presence?
I find his work derivative.
I would prefer the stop sign format
His denial of chicken road crossings remains a puzzle to me
The panel on the right is deer crossing in. The panel on the right is deer crossing out. The panel on the center is the well known The Buck Stops Here.
Finally, meaningful figurative work.
Deer, they still have not moved on from their black and yellow period.
At least the artist left the red nose off. It's so demeaning.
Night at the mooseseum
Apparently Hemingway was a big collector.
Can you believe how far we've come?
His yellow period is too primitive for me.
It's not worth the doe.
Social realism. He's only crossing boundaries.
This buck stops here.
They're beautiful, Glenn, but I'm really transfixed by the lighting.
Well they're no van Goghs.
She makes me horny!
Deer in the Tracklights.
The headstones of our ancestors
I liked the scale of his roadside work better.
This is ... US!
None of these horns look right to me.
The original's been sold, we'll have to settle for a giclee.
I've always been more of a dadaist than a mamaist...
Her painting upends art's white-male hit parade.
No, I don't think it makes you look fat.
Young Buck, my deer, to me, this is simply a matter of does and don'ts...
Let's talk.
Realism! Like a deer in the headlights.
I painted this in reminiscence of my first dinner out.
"What a great exhibit--an artistic tour de force!'
When it comes to this form of art, buyer beware!
It’s idealized.
Note the composition! The colors...
She always had a nice figure.
Derivative, but a good likeness.
Well it's . . . different.
Nothing is more beautiful than the female body!
I always found his symbolism disturbing.
I think it represents a cautionary expression for the rut in our existence
I prefer Monet.
So stereotypical...
...and this is my favorite. See how he is boldly addressing his male gaze origins...?
I just love the intimacy of this family portrait.
These signs are to deer as a trailer park is to tornados: They seem to invite disaster.
It speaks to me in a primal way.
Oh deer, we'll get a few bucks of doe for this show
Don't you find Pop Art appallingly derivative?
I prefer his red and green period
I wonder if it gets your best side deer ?
The originality in this artwork is simply brilliant
This is too old school for my tastes. Give me something that pops!
Yeah. But you didn't.
An excellent postmodern rendering, addressing the tragedy of fawn crossings
Deer, I herd the this show is stagnant. Don't fawn over it, whatever you doe.
I prefer his abstract period
This one is called "reign deer"
Eh...formula art—the artist sees us as all looking alike.
I think I’m gonna have diarrhea
"What about me"?
My two point buck could draw this.
It's so relatable.
The use of silhouette doesn't say much for technique.
Who would expect these invitations to our stag parties to become art?
It's been crossing my mind lately that we should not let Junior stray on his own.
What exactly is a semiotics focus group?
But his work is so derivative.
Sublime renderings of female form but he's even more interesting as a colorist!
Are you a fan of the still life?
I don't get it, do you?
I was free. Then I wasn't. Now I'm free again!
I've always been a fan of animalism.
I'm surprised they don't have a Swiffer by now.
Well this sucks.
They live on dog fur.
Ehhh, it's seems deerivative of Banksy.
This is obviously when the artist was crossing into his domestic period.
Oh my gosh, that looks exactly like Bucky!
Lyricism, clarity and accumulative wisdom. A dizzingly peripatetic, genre-bending foray into wildlife signs.
A grim reminder of our own mortality. As we cross the road, so comes the next generation. I need a nap.
This is clearly a tryptic about personal responsibility. In other words, the buck stops here.
This one seems Oedipal.
I like the use of primary colors but I found his oeuvre derivative.
It's very reductive.
The color palette could’ve been more elaborate.
...indicative of appeal to sentimentality marketing by emphasizing doe-fawn bonding.
So this is what the cavemen deer did in there spare time
At least this one isn't derivative.
How did they remove the bullet holes?
you will be avenged.
just love yourself
With regard to the issue of content, the disjunctive perturbation of the spatial relationship brings within the realm of discourse the distinctive juxtapositions.
His cubist period was SO overrated...
She was the doe of every buck's dream, believe me.
She's had work done.
That's one hot mama.
I wonder what happened to her after we migrated.
Yes, you're his father and my lawyer's going after your stomping grounds.
While I appreciate the idea of art I'm always struck blind and in a total paralysis due to the bright lights.
I wish they would dim the headlights at these things.
Social Realism? What a crap!
I like this one the best, the artist captures our family values.
Worst centerfold ever!
Does the deer have a little dough? Yeah, two bucks.
They're too lean looking, they must have been photo shopped!
My fawn could paint that.
They say that Randy Doehol was the original Pop artist. His abstract expressionism is timeless.
again, the unrealistic expectations of models
At best, it's a derivative piece.
I find the benign simplicity our early ancestors to be quite charming.
Don't feel bad, they say the street sign adds 10 pounds.
I think it's artistic rendering for culling the herd.
The first time I saw this stuff, I was knocked on my ass.
Frankly, I'm more partial to his earlier cave drawings.
If you take a photo with the flash, it looks like they are staring right at you, afraid to move.
Next, the exhibit moves to the North Pole.
That's what I call a family friendly road.
It's actually one of the first known examples of feminism
Leave it to White Cube to be boring yet again
Dada?
That was me with my mother before I became famous.
This collection is quite a few bucks.
This one's a little dear.
Oh, dear, I'm fawning over this one.
I love, love to shit, and also to piss, but mostly, above all, to shit.
Too bad the artist didn't capture Uncle Fred's good side.
So tortured, so very misunderstood.
This is bringing back some dreary childhood memories.
This show always puts on display those that emigrated here. Humorous though to think they now believe wall will stop them.
Looks like Darwin's recipe for elimination of the species.
Major rack one day, next day... you know.
The others just make 'em slow down; this one also brings out the iPhones.
I remember exactly where I was when I heard about this one...
What does it say to you?
It's true. Art does transport you to a different place.
It breaks new ground, even as it acknowledges a debt to tradition.
Honestly, I've seen this so many times that it's becoming stagnant.
I really preferred his Black Forest period
Deer, which door do you think we should choose?
Do you think it's time for me to get off birth control?
Portrays a bold XING art at night, with a vibrant headlight falling on it.
Sex and Death? Clearly, that's all they care about... over and over and over.
They certainly do walk funny.
Let's imitate them!
So this is the Mandonna and Fawn
Yes, but is it serious art?
Son since this picture you have really grown.
Looks like my fawn did it.
Silhouette gives Bambi an implied appeal.
Deer Judging Works of Deer
Pass.
They're fawning over us!" " They're fawning over us!
Wow. This changes everything.
Where's the one with the old man telling the wife and kids to look before you leap?
I like it, but it’s two deer.
Deer Museum
I prefer abstract art myself
Don't you just hate it when strong statement gives way to melodrama?
Do you think humans would still be here if they’d been protected as an endangered species?
Obviously this is where we are to cross, but for the life of me I am not seeing a road to cross.
From venison to sausages. How has the mighty fallen. Very sad.
A stunning Van Deer retrospective!
I'm think we dated.
Hi Kuper! What did you have in mind?
I think it's a replica.
Bet he drew it from a photograph.
I’m guessing it’s a Hopper.
Shall we buy it for our thicket?
Antlerson: "What's the name of this piece?" Hoofsky: "Deer crossing street." Antlerson: "...fascinating."
Looks like a new Andy Warthog series.
I am reading the caption . . . Deer strikes NOT covered under collision coverage!
It's X-rated.
It's phony. Wherever it is it's too hot for deer.
Where’s the guy with the white beard?
Nope, she never told him how much she hated Thumper.
Family portrait.
Not only were cars not self-driving, but Man drove them?
Yes, but it is Hart?
Deerivitive, so unoriginal.
I'm inclined to think this Nativity scene was the best work from his oft-ignored Silhouette Period.
I agree it disappoints, the offspring should be off springing like the others.
I would call it derivative.
The contemporary art movement feels stagnant.
It's got a je ne c'est quoi about it, a neo-maternalism heretofore not attributed to we woodland creatures.
My five-day-old could make this!
Why do you drag me here?
There's my son with my first grandchild!
Art is in the eye of the beholdeer.
Groundbreaking
You can call it art if you want, but I think it's inappropriate.
I realize that in this moment we are the art.
One can assume the artist has only a visceral understanding of what it truly means to be a deer.
Buck is the greatest of the young selfie artist.
They might as well be in a gallery. They don't do any good on the roads.
I'm just not ready to be a father yet
Hmmm..I see Bessie had a baby. I wonder who the father is?
I vote for this one. It's my uncle Buck!
Notice how it captures the very essence of the doe-fawn relationship.
Oh my...deer, I like this one.
Now as part of the opinion survey what do you think of the new "Baby on Board" prototype ?
The longer I look at it, the better I understand evolution.
this "world" is so full of sadness. and " unhappiness" lets" learn to let love shine"
The true art is in where you hang them.
But it lacks the Kinkade touch ..... a splash of headlights would be nice.
It just seems flat to me.
I prefer his earlier work, this is nothing to fawn over.
Do you think drivers ever notice these?
Mom and I posed for this picture.
This one hits home—it was placed near a Los Angeles freeway on-ramp .
Great show! All sponsored by the American Auto Insurance Association.
If it weren't for these head lights, I could see better.
Think they'll let us scratch and sniff?
They call this 'Art imitates life.'
You know Ralph, twins are the norm. Maybe you need some Viagra.
I still think it's a little too doe-centric
It's about time the art world appreciated the doe's gaze.
These latest trends are so deerogatory...
My kid could do this.
It just doesn't do it for me.
That's too dear.
Rutting season is off to an early start this year.
These probably cost a lot of bucks.
I agree. It's all about family values.
Look Dear ... a doe, a deer, a female deer ...
Next thing you know, they'll be wanting to drive cars.
We're undecided about public schools.
I've got the doe and you've got the bucks.... let's by some art.
Deer Kid ~
I really like the detail
It has some serious representational issues.
Even I could've drawn that!
Let's face it, even on the road a buck's not worth what it used to be.
Remember Blitzen? He was later enslaved up north.
Ah, the timeless inner struggle of the doe. She longs to keep the fawn close, yet senses that first bud of independence.
Personally, I've always been attracted to the female form.
We now suspect these were more than just public art.
beware of your own kind.....
What do you say we go hunting after this?
Any fawn could do these.
And yet no one asks why did the deer cross the road.
They never listen to the consultants!
Oh, but you see, they'd fail the mirror test: what differentiates us from lesser-evolved organisms is our self-awareness.
Rumor is that the younger one was last seen in the "Mountings Over the Fireplace" exhibit.
Don’t you just love the tilted axis of the image”?
Cameos don't solve the right-of-way issue!
My sons, we are visitors at the Stag nation mueseum of America!
I think John Deere made that one.
And they said we weren't so smart.
And all this from a time before we overthrew our non-deer overlords.
Easy! Don't rush. Wait till he does it.
nice art
All the lighting used actual car head lights.
The amazing art created by man, is inspected very carefully by the deer who once posed as an art piece.
Why are the signs in color?
I like to buy it, but it's just two deer.
As an impressionistic rendering of Bambi and his late mother, it fails to impress me. Clearly the artist is making a cry for help.
Ah yes...Post-modern Symbolism...some of my favorite works
THIS is what Grandma had to go through?
I still feel the one with the twins was more aesthetically pleasing.
This is what I call art.
It kills me when art like this is ignored.
I was never a fan of his yellow period.
Your mother was quite the model in her day.
oijhiulyg
A startling use of the headlights.
Interesting. Very minimalist.
I find these portrayals reductive at best.
Graceful, yet patronizing.
Strange that they depict us without violence and the killing of us.
It appears opposing thumbs does not a artist make!
Unforturnatly, there's not much doe in art.
Rutting is so last season.
These are good. I had trouble explaining the Jackson Pollock versions to my fawns.
Bucks aren't into shared parenting.
We really came a long way
I'm getting the creeps. Let's go back to the pretty landscapes.
You cannot tell when there are too many potential fathers...
These are all "found objects" discarded by the side of the road. Unfortunately, so's the gallery owner.
Hey, isn't that aunt Sylvia and her son Josh, it's a good likeness, they really captured their essence.
We call this folk art.
He just doesn't seem to capture the nuances of their relationship.
She got the record settlement -- and custody.
I know what I like. This is not art.
I find that these works deconstruct the semiotics of sign-making. And the doe is shwiiiiing!
Wow, that's a lot of "doe" for that portrait "dear.
So deerivative.
Geez, not another one titled 'Madonna and Child'!
It's probably my favorite Madoenna and her deer child.
What are you wearing to the Met Gala!
What ever happened to the glorious leaping stags, when men were men and America was Great! Pre-Gloria Steinem.
In this later phase, the artist turned from Leaping Stag to the Mother and Child theme, despite being distant from his own family.
Be careful with the humanity, they’re obsessed with us!
Instead of painting on velvet this artist paints with velvet.
Reminds me of Madame Monet et bebe.
Hubba hubba!
Aren't they just dear?
I swear they're dead ringers for the family I abandoned a few years ago.
"Blitzen-esque" don't you think?
The lines and shape are nice, but the composition really lacks depth, wouldn't you agree?
They have no idea, do they?
Ah, and my personal favorite. " Deer in Headlights"...in oils!
No, too derivative of Disney.
I thought there would be more to performance art.
The yellow has no depth.
She was my squeeze.
They moved them here when Haunch of Venison closed their New York gallery in 2013.
There's something about the bright lighting in here. I can't keep my eyes off of it.
If I had thumbs, I'd be embarrassed to put my name on this.
I don't like the way I look in any of these photographs. Darn papprazzi.
Bagel or toast?
I believe that the artist wanted the audience to feel pain and provide a statement that explains how all deer feel and the agony that they are consistently in.
This is birth control in the Trump era?
Things just won't be the same anymore without Hefner.
'Nothing runs like a Deere,' except the doe being chased by one.
That's not Art... That's Elliot.
I've never been in such a beautiful mausoleum
We had to hold still for hours while she painted us.
Er...maybe this whole 'animals are just like humans' has gone too far...
'Deer in the headlights'. Perfect.
Yup. Gender stereotyping.
He must have gotten that silhouette from a grandparent.
It's only "from the workshop of..."
I don't know why they have to have so many nudes, buck wild I say.
Fawn memories, right Deer?
It's evocative of the county's pre-hoofed period.
Hunting season call her twit brains instead of dear.
Is this really what we look like? Interesting....
A rare look at a Wildlife Focus Group selecting the new deer signs for the Highway Department
I’m not into this weird, way-out stuff. Where’s the leaping stag in this one?
Yes, but it is Hart?
It just doesn't speak to me
That is perhaps the most cautious attempt an a "mother and child" painting I've ever seen.
Do you think that yellow background makes me look fat?
You can just sense the foreshadowing of the Bambi gunman
You've seen one "Mother and Child", you've seen them all...
What's the big deal? My kid could do that.
I met her at a stag party.
I suppose we could borrow a fawn and cross there.
What a complex portrayal of the myriad pressures society places on does.
They're nice but they're a bit deerivative.
That *totally* looks like her.
Well Son, you were just a Fawn back then when your Mom & I were divorcing... I wonder if she ever learned to walk upright like us since then?
They're deer to my hart.
That kid is definitely not mine
No one can answer the obvious... which came first, the deer or the sign?
I DONT THINK THEY QUITE CAPTURED THE "IN THE HEADLIGHTS " LOOK.
Have you ever noticed how their eyes follow you?
I almost bought this one, but then I realized it would be two deer for me.
Ah yes, the pedestrianist period.
I may not be able to define it, but I know it when I see it.....
It's like... I know that fawn!
Towards the end of his career his creativity became stagnate .
I'm telling you Tom—art has no higher purpose.
I was raised by a single mom... strongest woman in the world.
“Afternoon if a fawn,” has a nice impressionist vibe to it.
Oh dear, her latest work is crossing into kitsch.
I'm intrigued by its existential angst
"It's title is "Chutzpah"".
Antelope Warhol is waaaayy overrated.
This artist is the deer equivalent of Andy Warhol.
They're all photo-shopped. No resemblance whatsoever.
I remember this one growing up in a school zone.
Alaska Daily News headline circa 1983 "Alaska Railroad = 135 / Moose = 0"
He was a lot edgier before he got married.
Leap of faith
It was an inside job.
Now Janice and her kid got pained too, how? I've been wandering by the road forever.
My kid always wanted to be a model.
This was created during his creative period
Awww! My fawn modeled for this sign.
It just feels a little safe.
I warned them not to cross here.
"Fawn of the Dead" is indeed an unsubtle warning to us all.
The artist really captures the emotions of parenthood, though one dimensional, it dramatically evokes memories of my youth.
Breeders!
I was told there would be headlights...
Hey Buck, I don't know about you, but I'd sure like to doe-see-doe with her.
Motherhood really changed her perspective
I tried to get the wife and kids to pose for this but she was busy that day.
The enigmatic smile always gets to me.
As illustrated here, the deep-seated fear of a powerful and reproducing 'other' led to politicized hate speech and propagandist warnings.
This one is quite typical from his Early Period
Feels a bit...pedestrian.
Yes, they do bring the picture plane forward. No wonder there’s so many damn accidents.
modern art for the fourlegged art enthusists
This seems a good alternative to online hookups.
You were right, deer. The leaping stag image has had its day.
Only an automobile driver would call this art.
Seems Warhol derivative to me.
Oh, I don't know. It just seems a little too dear for me.
There is hope. With these, we may not get caught in the headlights.
His work just doesn't do enough to buck traditional gender roles.
THERS MORE TO LIFE THAN HAVING FUN
So this is what we get after the critics eviscerated his headlights series.
My it’s too dear, don’tya think?
Oh yes. The Cassats are so dear.
Is that your dear or my dear?
Yes, it's by a new and exciting artist...Millicent Van Doe.
I don’t know, I’m not so sure about art in the age of internal combustion.
Yes, she played 'hard to get'.
Its not the price, it's the fact that it's so reductive.
It's the self-portrait thatvreally defines the artist.
It's all so deerivative.
Do you guys see what I see?” “Isn’t this sign referring to us?!” “Nooo, are you out of your mind!, we don’t like anything like what’s on the sign!
I'd rather view passionate Deer John letters than these pedestrian crossing signs.
I don't know anything about art but I know what I like.
That's Jennifer, my first. Junior's boarding at Groton.
This exhibition is profoundly moving for me personally evoking haunting memories of loss along I80 near Rawlins, WY.
Honestly, I like the Madonna and Child better
Sure, and next month it will be Beautiful Turkeys.
At the risk of stagsplaining, she should really cross in front of him. Anyway, why didn't your wife join us?
A link between us and these primative creatures? I just don't buy it.
I think this one's worth a couple bucks.
They're terrible for self-esteem; no deer is that skinny!
Four-legged, only seven years ago, our four-fathers brought forth ...that all are created equal.
My taste runs more to Andy Warhol.
This is gonna suck.
This exhibit predates headlights.
Emotional of course but financially it's worth less than a buck.
Quite a change from his "Headlights" period.
He's the Andy Warhol of deerdom.
Wow look at that is that Jimmy? No fair i wanted to be in that!
Her hopping days are history.
Ah the efficacy of representational art.
These are from Warhol's 'prerogative' phase.
They're so lifelike.
Do you know what this art is? I have no eye-deer.
You see, proof that these signs are a great way to meet up.
It's obviously mimesis dear.
I am forclempt.
His look on ourselves as animals is endeering.
I hear he didn't cut off the whole antler, just a part of it.
Brings back such memories!
Oh, how our deer friends will fawn over this one.
It’s a Ma-doe-nna and Child.
He doesn't even look like me.
Has no one ever seen us vacationing?
Art is a reflection of its citizenry, Buck.
The buck stop is here.
Signs of evolution were always there... now they are here, at Bipedal Institute.
Looking at deer in floodlights.
What the Buck???
Right now I'd pay max bucks for a bucks' box.
My six month-old could have done that. Wait, that is my six month-old!
Really? Stags leap, does stroll? Road art used to be so transgressive.
Yup, That's her. I told her she could be a model. I really like her but I think that wise little fawn has figured out my motives.
Controlling bitch and pupil.
Modern art, humpf. I mean, look at it... a whitetail deer with no tail.
You have kids?
Mr. Barenbaum, the men from Xerox are here.
A bit cervidacentric, wouldn't you say?
It's classic rear-garde!
Can you still remember our single days?
...and so you say the tractor trailer hit them shortly after you painted this picture?
I think his headlights series had more impact.
I prefer the self portraits from his Deer Me period.
This primitive art is very deer to us.
"I prefer his Naturalist Period".
A bit deerivative, don’t you think?
Is it me or is there a hint of sentimentality creeping into his work?
Frequently after these events their mothers end up raising them.
Well I think it is Fawn pornagraphy!
The artist's use of light is . . . .
Coming off the bench to get in the game may take a season.
From when Uber moved humans to Mars.
What proud animals our ancestors were! We have lost our dignity, our modesty, and our speed in becoming upright.
I don't know...it's a little too Neoclassical for me.
Considering all those yahoos out there with rifles this month, maybe instant highway suicide looks best.
Thanks for attending, deer friends.
So realistic!
C'mon! When have you ever seen a sky like that?
Andy Warhol's early years were so dark.
He used to be a street artist.
hey look it's my uncle gary.
Very Margaret Calvert.
She’s no Kara Walker.
Love the clean hooves and bold use of antlers.
I'd pay a lot of doe for this artwork
They're not really Instagrammable.
Atleast they appear to have moved on from that abstract phase where they made us have red noses.
I don't jump behind this modern art- why all the nudity?
Finally, equal rights for doe.
She was so much hotter before she had the baby.
Cherry Kearton or Ansel Adams?
Sure it's good art, but as Orwell says, "Two feet good, four feet bad.
Broke my heart getting that, "John Deer" letter.
These people paint just anything in the name of Modern Art.
Her profile is awesome but I don't like kids.
Poignant!
D.O.T. had to discontinue its use. Bucks were using it as a chick magnet.
It may be high art, but all I can say is, Oh deer....
Hey! I know him. That's Art!
Does everything need to be sexualized these days?
I don't care what they say, I still like representational art.
How do they make it here?
If they can promise me I will look that good in six months, I'll sign up for this weight loss program.
This series immediately preceded his Railroad Crossing period.
Highway robbery!
Where is the doe scent?
This one was near the Catholic Church.
Too plump for my taste.
Is this why we crossed the road?
I could swear they used my wife and daughter for that one.
Deer God this is in a museum? I can’t believe it’s priced over a million bucks.
They're great deer signs!
It's not my best work.
This is a self portrait of cousin Prancer & his son.
They got Big Doe for this.
This is from Bambi's "Yellow Period".
Dare I say, a bit deerivative?
Staggering!
For some reason everyone fawns over this one.
Deer me!
They look natural now but wait until they get caught in the headlights.
This really speaks to the duality of nature.
Don't even think about it - those days are long gone.
The perspective is really throwing me off, are they both in the crossing or not.
I'm with you, Dasher. Their accomplishments aren't worthy of this homage.
The centerfold in the November Deerboy Magazine is hotter than this one.
This fills me with bloodlust.
I think my favorite is this one...there's some endeering about it....
I would say this doesn't look good for Bambi's mom.
Yellow is the new orange.
These were commissioned by the Department of Highways.
okay, so it is not a Rembrandt, dear.
Again there's another one titled "Us Crossing".
Our early ancestors had excellent penmanship in their drawings, especially given that we have hooves.
Yes, he is a good artist, but it seems he is color blind.
This appeals more to the pro-lifers.
So this is how Godzilla found Bambi.
If you're feeling up to it, the Realist collection is next door.
Ungepatchket!
crossings is so 20th century, now we transition.
Uncle Buck was always dating younger women
The legs really say so much of the plight of our species.
I heard the artist is a neo-stagist. You can see his the male superiority in the way he objectifies the doe.
I'm frozen, someone turn off these headlights!
looks like were the last three deer standing.
Everyone thinks they're the next Kara Walker.
I think this one's about deer crossing over to 'The Other Side'.
'Exquisite portraits--don't you agree?'
To me, it's about liminal spaces. Thresholds.
These nudist deer paintings really turn me on
I only have visitation rights once a month.
I'm pretty sure this passes the Bechdel Test.
Remember, it was you who insisted on the vasectomy!
Yes, this is me before the sex change and, of course, before we learned to walk upright and talk.
I see it as a cautionary tale about dating a doe with a fawn.
It's too derivative
That sign was in Mexico, they're pretty laid back.
A rather brave act of reappropriatiation for a doe, don't you think?
What an ultra-mordern art
Deer in Headlights. Stunning.
Nice use of yellow space.
While other artists seek fame, he just does it for the buck.
Cleanliness IS Next To Godliness
'Breathtaking!'
Title 9 even here!
I'm partial to the Disney conceptualization.
I guess anyone can be an artist if they appear in a sex tape with Blitzer.
You just never see this anymore.
Can the fateful flattening of the picture plane prevent a fatal flattening by a passing car?
The artist clearly has mommy issues
Ah, so this is where the buck stops.
The Ma-DOE-nna and BAMBI-no.
Well, I'll give you a couple bucks for it."
Do you think the artist had a Bambi fixation.
This is pure deer danger exploitation, playing to the Bambi & his Mother thing.
There goes my modeling career.
Mesmerizing.
I the whole collection reveals the modern rut. (For the judges; this caption plays on the dual meaning of rut....most non New Yorkers would know this without explanation. Most New Yorkers would not
I can't help but fawn over this one.
This one was inspired by Bambi and his deer mother.
Stag Party for 3 Bucks! Fawn Over Van Doe!
I really think a show this controversial ought to have trigger warnings.
My wife's pressuring me to have kids. It just doesn't feel right in this economy.
I like it! For a birth-control PSA, it's pretty understated.
Never liked outsider art.
I learned to draw at home.
Deer, hand me my glasses.
Without that damned, 'Dear Crossing' it's a work of art.
It's a portrait of the artist as a Bambi.
Not sure I'm into his fauvist period. I liked his primitivism better.
All fours -- so last year.
It's a traveling exhibition from the Hudson River Highway School.
I'm considering getting this one, it's only one buck.
Shall we, dear?
as if the ladies didn't already drive ...
Doe life imitates art, or Doe art imitates life.
A Prancing Stag Is More Dangerous.
Uber changed everything.
It's unbecoming to fawn over yourself, deer.
Frank-I know this is a pun but I can't help it; These paintings are just so DEER to me. See what I did there?
They got shot and lived!
I don't know much about Art, but here he is in front.
And on loan from The Hermitage we have one of my all-time faves: "The Madonna and Fawn" by the late great Leonardo deer Vinci.
I can't stop staring; they are stunning.
These self portraits have an endearing quality you don't normally see.
Gertrude really was a looker!
I'm a family man, myself.
Really too bad she and the kid both got shot before they could collect any residuals.
Wisconsin is upping the ante.
These were completed during the humanist period.
Reminds me of Warhol's self portrait.
I prefer non representational art
It's just called Madonna and Child, circa 1980
Government coddling... It's a miracle anybody can stand on their own two feet.
They've got the general idea, but this yellow backdrop throws the whole thing off...just doesn't look real!
Yeah, right after Rudolph she left me for another doe.
It’s absurd to display this as art in a place like this!
Boy, these must cost alot of doe.
Is the artist reflecting an idealized cis-gender consciousness or a decolonized materiality?
She got everything in the divorce.
It's nice that they got my good side.
My wife and son posed for this one, back when he was still a fawn.
To me, it just looks like Faith and her fawn from down the road apiece.
No, it does not make you look fat.
I can't stop staring at her headlights.
I still prefer headlights
I think this gender equity thing is going too far!
Unlike his heroic pieces this is a metaphor for the suburban paradise.
Our ancestors were positively bovine, weren't they?
This one is my favorite. It’s called ‘Look Out for Madonna and Child.’
Sure, of course it's great--but did he have to call it "Mommie Deerest"?
Wonderful! They're finally back from touring!
I feel that these new domestic works are lacking the angst of his earlier Pronking period.
It's close to home, but I found the Burma Shave exhibit much more amusing.
But does art have to be about sex, sex, sex all the time?
Don't you agree, this one shows such spark and originality!
You named her Doe and not Bambi?
"The wife and kid got tired of all the "selfies".
"My cousin and his son we're the artists? 's models". "My cousin and her son we're the artist's muse's".
But you didn't...
His work is just so one dimensional!
Well I guess their intentions were good...
I am so happy to see he is over that people phase.
How quaint.
It's amazing, tremendous and the largest number in the history of the country!
This is gonna suck.
Groundbreaking or derivative?
I really like his yellow Cubist period.
'The buck stopped here'. Priceless!!
Call that portraiture? My fawn could do better!
It just amazes me what passes for art these days.
These paintings are very deer to me.
I believe the artist suffered from psychotic episodes...and in a fit of rage he severed his own antler.
I appreciate the stark use of contract.
The Deer DMV
Trying to find my mood for today.
Deer Safety Course 101
Such banal commentary on the danger faced by broken families of the polygamous Cervidae...as always, the buck stopped here and moved on.
We else do you think they've got for a few bucks?
This is my family, see the resemblance ?
Not bad for a biped.
Why is this piece so expensive? My 4-year-old child can draw better than this!
That's one ten point MILF.
I always enjoy VIP day at the Roadside Sign Museum.
You need to study these before you take the rutting test.
He'll really like the diorama of the old deer trails in the next room.
I see it less as a warning than I do an expression for engagement.
These drawings are meant to distract us during rutting season!
If you look closely, it's all dots.
We need to review the NO HUNTING signs in the next isle.
After the war.... We put up sighs the enemy made during such dastardly times in art plazas... Honoring our fallen enemy. Their noble defeat. People find them works of art... Me? I find them as reminders...
I'll tell you this Charlie, this "found art" thing going on right now would never fly back in our day...
Those were barbaric times, I tell ya ...
Here we see an example of a primitive piece from the "Department of Transportation".
I find it derivative
I heard that the deer who painted these died crossing the road on the way to tonight's opening.
The buck stops here, and here, and here.
They don't understand our proportions at all.
It's like we're two different species.
Yup, that was me just before Mama go nailed by a semi.
The subject matter is intriguing, but the Freudian underpinnings and psychoanalytical theories of a true, classic Dali are strangely lacking.
The detail and use of colors just boggles the mind.
Just as long as we win, they're adorable.
I just don't much care for this touristy crap, Dave.
The young buck's have a visions us old timer's dream dreams.
Staggering pics!
I prefer his earlier work.
That looks nothing like me.
I love his use of perspective.
It looks pretty old. Maybe some spy thing from the Hoover FBI days.
Still we graze.
At least this one is less dehumanizing.
So you're telling me she cut out gluten? -Yes, Marv, and you can see she looks great, but Fawni has ADHD, so you can't buck em all."
Nothing says Renaissance better than the Madonna and Child sign.
I'm tiring of the warning sign motif.
I like it. It really bucks the trend.
Hey Kim , could you remove just the orange stain!!
As can see here, once you give birth, you'll no longer be able to jump due to your weight gain and you'll most likely get the "Mom" antler trim.
And David Salle said this was hogwash
I know it's prime yellow period, but really what does it say to us?
Never saw her in my life.
But not a single car crossing sign was posted
I know it's just street art, but the models are dear to me.
Nothing upright about these!
Derivative or genius? Or bathroom?
Hm. It’s said these creatures are some of the dumbest that walk the earth.
Excuse me, what's the time? I need to get home to feed my human.
These signs are great but they have to also reduce and display the speed limit.
This doesn't do you justice
Dayum, dat ass doe!
This is a little two deer for my tastes.
Fascinating, but you should check out the abstracts in the windshield exhibit - wow!
Did you read the deer urine article in last week’s “New Yorker”?
To me, it's a body image issue. No real doe looks that good so soon after giving birth.
Is it me, or does this make you horny?
Definitely reminiscent of Whistler, with a twist. A study in black and yellow.
Another sign of preferential gender treatment.
A little more headlight and you could see the expressions better.
So, what’s the big deal?
Honestly honey I haven't been unfaithful.
He got the color right, but it makes her look fat
I wouldn't say fat--more like pleasantly plump.
Heartwarming, yes, but static pose leaves me underwhelmed.
I am so not ready for kids.
"I am told there was a Day when these weren't necessary for a safe crossing on our bucolic Glens".
Rudolph could fly, now look at him.
I just love impressionism. Though it looks more like a goat.
Frankly I find the artist's oeuvre a tad too endearing.
She appears to be a shadow of her former self. As a stag, I can relate.
Must be the van Doe...
Are my antlers really just lines?
I don't know. I don't think it's worth 3,000 bucks.
This show will be a big hit if they take it on the road!
Hey guys, do I look fat in this?
He told me they looked better with direct horizontal lighting, and I told him to hit the road.
They've done a cracking job with the airbrushing
I find the benign simplicity our early ancestors to be quite charming.
I think this one represents the perils of too much prancing.
She did Jillian Michaels.
Hmm, 'Doe, a Deer.' Why does that sound so familiar?
I understand they are asking forty sows and bucks for it .
Andy Warhol is prolific, and creative. Shall we dance?
This one elicits a feeling of 'calm before the storm'.
It's so clearly Photoshopped
We are so blessed most drivers find us too tough to chew.
Yes. I find quadrupeds much more alluring, too.
Can't tell if it's a Picasso or Rembrandt.
His later work lost its edge, yet retains a glimmer of incendiary observation vis-a-vis the form of line and structure.
I had no idea they still made canister vacuums.
Wanna check out the Mapplethorpes next door?
It doesn't speak to me.
I'm still only seeing shades of gray.
They could stand to expand their palette.
Much easier than choosing the lady or the tiger
Under the light, his eyes DO look like Jr.
Wow, they really jump out at ya.
I feel the internal dynamic of the biomorphic forms verges on codifying the accessibility of the work.
The artist is good but has a very limited range of subject and color palette.
We were making great progress, but then came the apprentice presidency.
It just doesn't speak to me
Why, yes. Racial identity AND traditional gender roles within the traditional herd structure!
"I thought Banksy was supposed to be ironic".
Sure,it means relax you're in a no Buck zone...
I find that these representations of fawn-rearing as the highest embodiment of the feminine take me out of my rut.
The early works were more abstract, but I feel these carry a more meaningful message.
It borrows so many tropes.
It says it inspired the Tupac hit "Deer Mama."
No great artist ever sees things as they really are. ~Oscar Wilde
Prosaic but endearing . . .
His work is a real reflection of society.
Oh deer! From here it realistically captures us being captured
Since we're stuck here, what do you do for a living?
Still life?
My fawn can draw better than that.
Oh Dear, ...Oh Dear
A doe and fawn crossing, not just the traditional deer crossing.
Well, to me it's a commentary on the responsibilities and sacrifices of the single parent. What concept do you think the artist is trying to convey?
I ended up with larger antlers but mom always liked you best.
Yes, there is an undercurrent of impending doom, but it fails to transcend its status as iconography, to become memorable as a work of art.
It does nothing for me. Not since those conservationists got me with that dart.
The peril of humanity provides context even in his most peaceful works.
This exhibit makes me feel rather cross.
I'm still not sold on the color. But the hindquarters do draw the eye.
Now this is new to the Wells wing, 2017 if I am not mistaken
Goodyear and Hoover have strong offshore competition.
Ironically, Bambi's Mom never saw it coming.
With all the isms elsewhere on the art scene, it's good to see they're retaining the realism perspective.
I literally have no idea what this is supposed to represent.
Rumpalicious.
“I do like the family shot”.
"This was from his fawn period".
You have to ask yourself what the artist was thinking, is this his portrait of Doe and Fawn, should he have had more Impressionism in his study or he may have tried being more Abstract
Rudolph left mailing industry to follow his painting dreams. It was a mistake.
And here I thought she just gained weight.
This used to be popular, before Walt Disney made Bambi.
Remember, that was Henry at three months.
I still think Ler was a strange name for my aunt.
Hanging on For Deer Life
A bit on the nose, don't you think?
She's aging like a fine wine.
[no caption]
My deer, this is how our ancestors crossed the street.
Did you really just call this "deerivative?"
Modern art is a scam. If these really all meant something, they'd need more than two colors.
It is simply astounding how far we have come as a society in bucking the old defined gender roles!
The artist was hit by a car after making this.
Do you think Bambi gets residuals?
I thought this was a stag party
The autobiographical nature reminds me of Thomas Wolfe
When I was your age, the moms stayed home with the kids.
Thank goodness they got my good side.
They're realistic, but they don't quite capture our joie de vivre.
The show last year at Lascaux was way better.
'Couldn't they make us look more Jordanesque?'
He's pushing the envelope and I don't like it.
I totally get the LGBT reference, Tommy, but what's with the kid?
We need more maternity leave so does don't have to cross the road with their fawns.
One dimensional...flat...and boring.
The semiotics of it intrigue me.
These are from the peak of the Homosapienic Period. Very primitive. Saw everything in black and white.
They strictly enforced the one child policy in those days.
Maybe. But you didn't paint it, did you?
An endearing exhibit at the Museum of Homo Sapiens Artifacts. Post Trumpocalypse.
I find his pre Cro-magnon drawings much more evocative.
It's so revealing of our domestication.
Ah, another painting by the highwaymen
Is that Art?
Yes. "Prancer & Dancer met/made Doe and Fawn is a nice show."
I don't know if the artist has fully captured the angst of motherhood.
Realism is so yesterday.
For this one, the model chose to remain anonymous.
Bambi??
Is little Bambi a boy or a girl?
Dear deer, deer.
The Jackson Pollocks the cars made are in the next room.
Wife: I don't know what you see in her dear!
We have come a long way
As the curator of this exhibit, I can honestly say that I like my family picture over the one of me leaping on the road.
I know you like that we're finally making it back onto the museum wall, but I don't care for abstract fauvinism, obviously created by and for gun-slinging humans without a sense of smell!
The sentiment draws one in, but it lacks the lithic quality of the classical form.
Probably safer to do it at the light.
I see no reason to fawn over this piece, dear, rack or no rack.
You know deer you are still very beautiful
Now I know why that guy with the paints also had headlights with him.
Objective Art is so passé
[no caption]
Lookout for animals! Call me "Roadkill".
We all looked so young back then. Then the tragedy happened and poor little Bambi was never the same.
“Hey Thurman, look over here, found Uncle Norse!
I'd say "Art for Art's sake," but this did not actually help Art, did it?
Striking, yes, but missing that headlight appeal.
DOE: "Oh, dear." BUCK: "What."
I like the use of headlights to emphasize the latent quadruped...
I find it an enervating critique on the passage of time…
It says this marked the beginning of his blue period.
These are clearly from his Cerva period.
Did you ever see Bambi the Musical?
This one was conceived by the Diversity Focus Group.
paparazzi stuff. Shouldn't be anywhere near a gallery.
Black is such a slimming color.
That was your mother and younger sister before the accident.
I find his work incredibly edgy; he really bucks traditional forms of artistic expression.
The emotion is there, but will it stop an AK47?
We have many pieces yet to see, Deer. Let's not fawn over this one.
An unwed doe with a fawn. A welfare case if ever I saw one.
I am not the father of this fawn. It doesn't look at all like me.
If only my buck stopped there.
It's how things were before the uprising.
Remember when there wasn't a "potty correctness" era?
I find this one too ungerpotched.
Our pre-ancestors haven't learned to walk and maybe they haven't learned to talk.
My five-year-old fawn can draw better than that.
This is a lot less disturbing than the artist's "Three Dimensional Mounted" phase...
Deer 1: Which one you like the most? Deer 2: Hard to say, they are all deer to me.
To think there are people who deny the Holo-cross.
Gloria Steinem . . . ah, her Doe-illism era.
Kids definitely curbs your enthusiasm…
Signs of life? Psshh.
Why did the deer look at the photos of deer crossing the road? Because those were his family that got caught in the headlights.
The young ones these days...where's the modesty??
I'm rather fawned of this one
One,two,free!
I love this artist's work. It always brings me back to doe.
OH-SURE, not likly after they gave us those berth-control shots
It's obviously French.
Do I look fat in this?
I just love it. It's reminiscent of Matisse's flat color planes combined with the playful pop culture reference of a Warhol.
Oh deer, this one's just too abstract for me.
I prefer the classic deer crossing sign.
I've seen these somewhere before.
Where is the deer in the headlights ?
Sheepish? Very funny, Harold.
This artist is so clearly so démodé--out of step with the time.
Our species hasn't changed much over the years, have we?
The nose isn't even red. I'm not buying it.
This one's my favorite from Albrecht Deer.
This is getting me rock hard.
I would NEVER let my doe cross the road first!
Let’s see if they slow down for Bambi.
Why question the attribution? We can`t read!
He was ahead of his time in his road warning sign period.
What the Buck???
I like the way his early work shoes a focus on family.
'Buck Naked,' at the MOMA.
I assume the artist's models were not harmed in the making of these representations.
Dear, extinction is approaching in leaps and bounds.
Say what you will but at least they were somewhat considerate
Every Spring we get--'new antlers' sounds better than 'horny.'
Upscale crossing
It's better than a shooting gallery.
I think the artist really captured your essence
Upright moose against signs of traffickin’ art.
If only there had been self-stopping cars...
This art work is so dear!
The models are too Hollywood.
That's what you want for two bucks?
Honestly Stephen, I've never been much for street art.
Were these works of art designed to engage drivers to slow down or enrage them to speed up?
You'd never know it, but that's my daughter in-law and grandkid.
Walk between the jumps!
By using subtle movement, the composition arrests caution.
Yeah, you got to study the drivers' manual
They call this one Broadway, Baby Boogie!
Now, dear, where were you when I was picking berries.
He's no Robert Bateman!
When your mom left she told me she was deer-resistant. Always with the jokes!
I don't know about you, but I find these Madonna and Child pieces a little tiresome.
These are all waring signs for whitetail deer.We are mules.
Oh dear god, not another Sign of the Cross exhibition.
I can't help it. I just love modern art.
Is nothing sacred?
I believe it was his early Bambi period.
These cave drawings are quite interesting.
We aren't special snowflakes?
"Yield" signs my (white-tailed) ass.
I can't believe these were so popular.
I remember when they were just pictures of birds and bees.
Please don't stare at the artwork. The headlights exhibit is just down the hall.
This one almost makes me wish I'd brought the doe and fawn! [almost in italics!]
These warning signs lack the light of impressionism..
...have a little doe? 'Soy-tanly!... 2 bucks!!'
art has no craft anymore, my kid could do this
This was part of the artist's domestic period.
I told you when we met my Deer, I was once a model.
I don't know, Erica, it just doesn't speak to me as art.
Before you know it, we'll be wearing helmets!
This artist needs to develop more in other mediums.
We've come along way from being hunted and gathered.
I do admire the flashes of creative sensitivity in the species, though. And the occasional compassion, as evinced by the auto deer whistles in the Technology Wing.
Finally! We have our own hart gallery!
They're posing them so young these days.
They make life in the pre-emancipation period look surprisingly pleasant.
It’s a shame your Uncle Buck insisted on going stag at the I-95 crossing.
C'mon-- you really like this? It's just so unnatural!
I like an artist who bucks the system.
A fine attempt by humans, although rudimentary, at a representation of the symbolism of innocence, and the fundamental desire to be nurtured and protected....
They could have been mine if I hadn't bucked the system.
*deer noises*
'This one looks like it smells good."
I still prefer the impressionists.
Are you kidding? My fawn could do that.
His early cave wall works are better.
Madonna and child, even ironacally, is such a cliche.
It doesn't mean "Stop" and it doesn't mean "Railroad Crossing Ahead," but I just don't know for sure what it signifies when you're behind the wheel....
What an eye opening exhibit.
I told you not every hunter shoots to kill.
Looks like we're SIGNED UP for the season
I'm gonna sound like a dirty old buck, but I wouldn't mind doe see doeing with that one!
Art, schmart...that's some DILF!
Do you think they knew it wasn't a speed camera?
I'm not really into Madonna and Child art.
Composition is good, yes. But I find her work rather cisgender-centric; plenty of antlers leaping over things, but not any tending to the children.
And they called us simple.
He heard "doe art."
It's certainly different.
Without a buck there is no family planning.
I can’t wait until rutting season.
Do you remember when Bambi was little and played with Thumper and Flower?
Doesn't look much like Karen, but I'd recognize that fawn of hers anywhere!
The artist experimented with a circular canvas next.
The artist is an avid hunter trying to counter the implications of the movie, "Bambi".
This one will make them think twice.
I'll watch the door while you go.
At least they're better than the ones in the headlights.
I much prefer the warmth of this two-bedroom.
You ever notice how none of these signs face right.
be your self dear
It smells of nothing like life.
It's the Afternoon of a Faun Hoof print.
I would have preferred names in black marble.
It makes me so horney!
He calls it "Deer in the Headlights".
The "Caught in the Headlights" installation utilizes overhead lamps to drive home the idea that one may still ascend to heaven post fatal impact.
"Just think,our youngest finally off on her own".
She's known for her still lifes but her still alives are pretty good, too.
It’s your turn to get up at night
Kid looks just like you, George.
« Mommy Dearest Crossing? »
Derivative, don't you think?
It's a shame he only received recognition after he died.
Who do they think they're kidding?! Just because it's here doesn't make it art!
The gallery has really gone downhill. I don't get this at all.
I prefer wildlife art
Ars gratia hart.
These are the ones that didn't get my tweet about headlights.
Hmmm. She is really spoilt for choices. Why would she accompany her mom or dad?
Sorry, Rudie, this trans-gender one does nothing for me!
I prefer de Kooning.
I prefer his earlier work, the "Cross Walk" collection
Sure it bucks the trend, but it's nothing to fawn over.
Ah yes. Little Buckshot.
Don't you hate women who use their children to get attention?
I think I’ll scream if I see one more show about identity politics.
Are you trying to tell me something dear?
The after story inspired the Disney movie
It was from his socialist realism period.
Does anyone even remember the days before deer equality?
Warning -- being horny can produce these results.
These aren't especially fawning.
Just look at this Peter, another yummy mummy trying to get known for ‘having it all’
My kid can paint better than this.
I did this one right after Vixen and I had Rudolph. He was such a bright baby!
That Cindy Sherman really is quite something.
Modern? Postmodern? Or crap?
I understand the artist got his start painting targets for a gun club.
Instead of ‘It sucks’ you could say, ‘It doesn’t speak to me.’
How did we become two dimensional silhouettes?
Remember when you and your mother posed for this? We should have asked for more.
The women are always painted so disproportionately.
First time I saw it, I cried and I cried.
Ahhh yes...Bambi guilt. Very emotive.
Don't worry about them. You will never have to pay child-support.
It captures Bambi well but doesn't do you justice.
Art!? This is nothing but a two-dimensional cultural appropriation!
It was interesting to see all the furniture..
For me, it just lacks the power of the artist's other pieces.
Humans and their gender stereotypes...
Last month’s exhibit on Why did the rabbit cross the road? was much more thought provoking!
Dear, oh deer, oh deer.
Deer, Remember when Junior crossed the road for the first time?
Well, they strike me as transitional.
It just seems awfully deerivative, don't you think?
The family crypt.
They didn't have to pay a lot of bucks for this one.
I hear Santa got ticketed for not heeding this warning sign.
It's a new highway art form. Totally lacking in originality.
Dad always said you shouldn’t be alone if you are going to stagger.
This artist, like our President of the United Horses of America, is a malignant narcissist!
Aliens suck.
They come once a week since Pluto lost its planet status.
I'm a bit perplexed by these, deer.
For me it's derivative.
I love street art.
I'm quite fawn'd of that artwork titled "Not sure if I should cross the road or stand in the middle of it."
Dear deer.
I still think some of his best work came from his "PedXing" period.
At the risk of pedantry, it’s fawn, not faun.
I'm guessing it's a Hoovercraft.
Who gives a damn!
The protect society has some great ideas.
No, I do not think he made your butt look big.
Those doeflakes just won't stop.
Does it make me look fat?
Who goes first?
She never knew what what her.
This was when my dad, and I, first crossed together. I really miss him!
They say the artist made a ton of dough on this one.
This is a rare first edition that had to be dumbed-down for the "target audience."
If they were humans, they'd have halos.
It really speaks to the hart of the matter.
I prefer 'Yummy Mummy' over 'Stags' Leap'. What say you, Mr.Brown?
Don't even think about it dear!
Mother and I posed for this one.
He’s fawning to his audience.
Deer me...I had expected a much more subtle exhibit.
Nice, but the price is too dear.
I'm so sick of these patriarchal standards of "quality."
fuggeddaboutit!
And the juxtaposition of the light and the dark--they've really captured the banality of Bambi.
This is Van Goes "Dear in Headlights."
We'll get revenge for the road kills. The other museum wing has every stop sign in the county.
Let's deer the deer. the deer. fuck.
That doe, doe.
What he lacks in realism he makes up for in composition.
Why do they always show us walking on all fours?
That reminds me, Eric. I just filed a trademark for MAQA - Make America Quadrupedal Again!
Title? I call it "In the headlights."
I think the gallery robs it of its original strength...
I prefer these to Jackson Pollack's road kill paintings.
Family portrait.
I see why you don't like modern art.
...and the wee buck there is Ray, a drop of golden son.
Hmm, it looks like a pre-car VanDoe
Ignore him.
Even when the fawns and does were shot and killed, the lawmakers did nothing to change the gun laws and now there's none of them left.
Photorealism it's not.
They all look like Bambi to me.
My grandfawn could create better art with her crayons!
Do we spell it 'faun' or 'fawn' ?
...monkey wins selfie suit, so tell me why pre-historic cave artists can't win this copyright lawsuit?
Here's where art and beauty truly lie in the eye of the beholder!
Does she still cut on herself; and masturbate excessively?
Madonna of the Crossing
It's a bit derivative of early homo sapiens.
Wheres the buck representation?
This one captures cervine for me.
I think the signs are working.
I never met any does here. How about ewe?
Hmm ... deer beneath can lights.
Another boring celebration of motherhood.
Myself, I like the madonna type.
His use of overspray is remarkable.
'Our safety?' Body-shaming, that's all it is!
No horns! I don't get the symbolism.
This one definitely breaks with the "old horned male" imagery so dominant in the art world.
Yes - this was before Bambi was elected president and banned automobiles.
It's a shame that there used to be a government program for this, as well.
Sort of Daliesque don’t you think?
My fawn could have painted this crap.
I always knew your beauty would be recognized someday.
This is from Buck Paulson’s dark period.
Wow, in this one he really captured the female form!
'For Lifetime Achievement: Great Artist, Great Mom and Total Party Animal'
Are you telling me the pill didn't work?
I don't know...I still think I would've added a lot to the sign's effectiveness.
Too cute by half.
Frankly DEER, I don't give a damn
It's reminiscent of her earlier Neo-Bambi period.
Simple, yet transcendent. I must have one.
She reminds me of my wife.
You can see that the hart isn't in it. I think he painted it just for the doe.
I thought his painting of the Brillo Box was much more compelling.
Tell me again, what were our ancestors so afraid of?
Why am I so successful in collecting art? Because a smart man once said to me, "invest in what you know."
Dear, that photo of you with our little one was taken before you grew those pointy little horns!
Ah, remember the days when there was just one bush for all of us?
I'm still pissed at that tractor guy for stealing my idea.
Now this one will definitely set you back a buck or two. Hee, hee.
Deer Jumping #375
Who knew Hoover would go Galactic?
Let's Do It!
How much doe do they want for this one?
Stagus erectus: ruminating on ascendency to bipedalism.
Heeding traffic signs is a lost art.
An early Madonner and child, circa 1983.
I'm concerned with the iconic representation of the mother-child relationship within the high expressed emotion level of the family dynamic...
I love the social commentary and associated cautionary message for he is telling with these pieces.
The artist has incredible use of color.
A DILF, definitely a DILF. I know one when I see one.
What a life, eh?!
This artist specializes in crossing signs. This one just does not jump out of me.
I don't think he's getting this.
This work is ahead of its time.
Ah, the art of avoidance.
He was a deer caught in still lifes.
I'm feeling a bit peckish. Let's amble over to the cafeteria.
She was the first Jane Doe to sue for gender equality.
It lacks conviction
It's a classic example of Pre-NRA art
That's an old piece of art back when they walked on all four hoofs.
...but it’s the negative space that’s do arresting.
This art form is truly unappreciated.
I thought this was a stag party
She was not sure who the father was.
Fawn, fawn, fawn! Try becoming more eclectic.
I know I'm a hart, but I don't know whether I like this.
And this is a work from the artist's "two period".
There's nothing there to hang your hat on!
I’m not really into realistic art.
I think he has captured the substance, but not the true essence.
His work’s lost all its intensity since he had children
Family or Trans-gender?
Dough, a deer, a female deer.
...forever the same road sign: exercise caution for mom and Bambi...but assume we are deadly projectiles.
What a momma's boy.
I definitely prefer prequels to sequels.
He received a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts.
Yes, we need to protect our genetic investment.
They borrowed this one from the Shooting Gallery.
Your friend Deerbenkorn’s road sign has a certain je ne sais quoi, but we’ll agree that he’s no Deergas!
'Deer Crossing'
[I think no caption is needed]
I think it looks better from a distance.
I always dreamt of being displayed somewhere on a wall someday.
Ya know, it seems just like yesterday when that shot of the family was taken, just before they were really shot.
Not everything is about you!
Perhaps our ancestors could have taken walking lessons, if they only had more dough.
Doe and Fawn Crossing Delaware Avenue still stirs the soul.
Let me tell you what _I'd_ wish for: no more burnt toast!
It's time to change the bag
We've come a long way, baby.
Ah, yes - it's most certainly symbolism of the plight of searching for our inner headlight, so as not to buck away from going at life stag, whilst learning not to fawn over others. What do you think Cari, my beau?
What concerns me is that it says the artist's medium is "found objects".
That's the best picture of mom ever taken.
I'm not fawn of this doe.
Says here that this is the earliest of all of his prolific self-portraits.
This job sucks.
Does that thing look like us ? I cant tell haha ! I am pretty sure that thing looks like us but I wonder why he is on that yellow thing!!!
Why do they have me on a sign" "I don't know, maybe they thought you were a-dear-able
No wonder they keep hitting us. This thing doesn't smell.
A doe in a caution sign? I'm offended.
Typical colonialist view! So degrading!
Hey, wait, that's MY portrait! I'm suing for copyright infringement.
He painted these around the time he was managing the Venison Underground.
She really knew how to save a buck.
Let's make a deer.
That is my ex.
This piece isn't making me cross
It's definitely a Warhol!
I’d go for her if she weren’t encumbered with the kid.
Mona and her daughter Lisa. It's perfect.
Really--Field & Stream in the restroom?
Doe know, Gus...guess it means we get smaller as we get older.
I just realized something. Isn't it deer hunting season
This one yields a certain paternal aspect.
That's too dear.
Some sophisticated cave drawings eh? Wonder what they were trying to tell us...
I really do miss my Mom, she was such a Dear.
As Dali could have said, 'We are all hungry for asphalt images.'
isn't that beautiful deer?
...and they believed boundautocide was unintentional.
I prefer the Swiss originals.
It's almost like a cross between something.
She's angry - he said no one will recognize it is her.
And this one was when I had to take the wife and kid along last rutting season.
This isn't bad, but the 'Headlights' exhibit is mesmerizing.
Should we call them Neanderthals?
fuck this. my kid could do this shit.
These are “safe crossing” signs.
You know, it's just not as finely observed as the Madonna and Child I saw last month in Paris.
Still life?
The artist failed to capture Mom's enigmatic smile.
There he is. So young, such a jumper!
I thought Eloise had twins.
These depictions date back to the pre-autonomous vehicle era.
Why should anyone be cautious about our doing what comes naturally?
And you say you want children
Which hashtag would you use to tweet about it?
This one captures my gentle longing for days long gone.
Sadly, it was painted on the saddest day of Bambi's life.
My mother was such a dear.
This piece here was also done prior to the deer takeover of 2017." "Humans were so bad at art.
It certainly makes one pause and reflect.
After that accident out on I-5, the school board decided to add this one.
I don't love the background, but the realism is amazing!
They didn't get the tail just right.
These are very Kara Walker-like.
No, deer, that picture does not make you look fat.
So much less confusing before those genDEER laws were passed
Representational is so passe.
Caution to drivers or enticement for hunters? So subjective.
Technically, silhouette's are nudes, but they lack a naturalistic element.
The lighting is damn near perfect to
Self portrait before the antlers?
If only they had posted these on roadways with lighter traffic.
I must tell my family, that they should never wander from the saety of the woods.
She looks good for her age.
The "art" happens when a car hits a deer. Seriously though– is it privileged to say I regret my MFA?
I think I dated her.
I'm transgender.
And now for something completely different.
Son, I just want you to know I will still be supportive if you prefer deer with racks.
Postmodernism is dead... I'd rather be reading the Open Swim weekly news letter, you know what I mean?
WithoutbeatingaboutthebushI'msureit'sderivative.
They look so frightened, yet unafraid.
NOW do you feel like an ass?
This Andy Ewehall speaks to me.
It He takes designing to a new level
Glad we stopped here. The next one isn't 'til Whoville.
I'd say it's definitely worth more than a few bucks.
``I hope this guy has a day job.''
That's Mary's bastard son.
This artist, like our President of the United Deer of America, is a malignant narcissist!
Is tis the new deer porno?
I'm looking at wildlife here. One moment of being wild and now a little one.
He has your ears but my nose.
Crossing fingers they will find this a suitable alternative when featuring us in their wall art.
This one is the pre Bambian period; before the invention of rifles.
I told you that he could go either way.
I find his new work a bit too realist
I won't be buying- it's just two deer.......
Oh boy, another artist inspired by Mommie Deerest.
Ugh, their perspective is all wrong.
He painted this during his Fallow period.
Us again, this time rendered more modern, a style so representative of the artist's post-cave-dwelling period.
Wow Bob, These Andy Deerhol prints are going for HOW MUCH??
So that's what it meant all this time...
It has little impact on me.
It's like looking in a river.
I'd appreciate this so much more if I could see yellow.
...
Clearly, but what does it mean?
She was fawning adoration but what she really wanted was the bucks.
I have never seen a more accurate depiction of Modernity - Have you Maurice?
Rt 28? Fugetaboutit!
I think it speaks to a transformative pedagogy that Pollock never even approached with his splashes of complacency. But that’s just me
Wait a minute! Didn’t you say this would be an installation of pronk art?
I'd insist on a DNA test. He doesn't look at all like you.
Always figured I'd be on the wall before they would.
This photorealism is spectacular.
This is my favorite Madonna and Child.
What a deer exhibit!
And next they'll be demading their own votes.
I call it "The Afternoon of the Doe Fawn"
This modern stuff is pointless.
His proportion really catches you off guard.
I'm looking for the bathroom.
Tsk, tsk. They don't use birth control, then complain when hunters 'thin out the herd.'
Like mother, like son."
This one speaks to the sense of maternal strength so prevalent in our society.
Everyone will be famous for 15 minutes.
Oh, dear, it all seems so derivative.
This one seems more diverse.
I'm absolutely dying to say that I enjoy artists of this elk.
I see you over deer
He seems to be in a rut.
Reminds me of a really upscale watering hole I used to frequent in my single days.
Do you think it makes her look fat?
You really want one with a desk and a computer?
If those cavemen ever learn to paint, this could be our future.
Stark and creepy enough to make me want to bolt!
Great picture of Mom!
I'm just not feeling it . . . you take your time, I'm gonna check out the stop sign thing . . .
Gender identity is more than motherhood.
I'm not really sure what the artist is going for here.
Seems no one respects the buck anymore.
Oh deer, road venison
I don't get it. But I'm probably just blinded by sorrow from the loss of my wife and child.
...
Vincent Van Goat knows nothing about the Cervidae figure.
It combines the social concerns of Barbara Kruger with the aesthetic of `Bambi.'
"True, but does it speak to how we cross the road TODAY?" [all caps = itals]
I think Renoir should have stuck to women with parasols.
Oh, it’s a Party!!!
Where will this equality debate end? Next, they will demand "doe only" hunting licenses.
What do you think Yayoi Kusama would have done with this topic?
This is a classic: Ma Donner and Child.
The Blitzens felt remorse at having been estranged from their enslaved ancestors.
Art for hart's sake
Andeer Warhol was so ahead of his time.
Yield to one of those and your stag days are over.
I think the fawn resembles the buck on the left more than the buck on the right. When will the paternity test results be ready?
She's still mad at me.
I just feel bad those who didn't make it across the road to see this.
That ‘62/‘63 championship herd was incredible. So many legends.
This color is lost on me.
Looking at majestic deer art.
Don't look so cross.
Oh deer! These are just fawnbulous!
I've always loved the Moosanna and Child motif.
Honey, don't you think the artist depicts the DEFUNDING of PLANNED PARENTHOOD & teenage counseling services...... ?
You're right, he only uses black and yellow. Rather tedious.
I heard he has to take his son with him to work since his wife was hit by that truck.
milf.
Too bad the buck didn't stop there.
I was shocked when he took this one from Rte. 28. Drivers are not slowing down for that fake Van Gogh he put up. cheap Van Gogh Cheap
The dominant species must be the one leading the two subspecies.
Why did the deer cross the road?
I think these are from his deer-in-the-headlights period.
It's difficult for today's Deer to imagine a time when crossing was segregated among the sexes...
They're draining the swamp.
We're about to get steampunked!
I'm surprised it's not a Roomba.
I told you that wall wouldn’t keep away good help.
'They really are advanced. It's cordless."
Please smack this as hard as you can.
I prefer the portraits, this one is just too cutesy
Where is her tail?
son look at your ancestors this is them walking across the street in 1995.
oh deer, I'm faMOUSE!
Dave come on were over here i don't wanna look at my brother anymore come and see my mom and dad. come one Dave its time to go
I've already preferred more natural settings.
The artist really captured the emotion between mother and child in this one called, "Bambi's Mother.
Personally, I prefer cubism to this two-dimensional realism.
At least her tail doesn't cover her...
Hall of famous deer
October is open season for humans. It's about time my artwork was noticed.
look its a old picture of made by dearanglo
They sure want a lot of doe for this fawn art.
The road kill was tough at first.
I think this one really showcases that we are a family oriented species
But is it art?
I want one without baggage
I think this one really captures the essence of the doe-fawn relationship, don't you?
Toughest fifteen minutes of fame in the biz
Am I a Sheila or a bloke!
I'm not sure if I like Madoe and Child better than either Man in the Blue Felt Horns or Gay Doena Lisa
Too "deer in the headlights"; the artist needs to yield more to his process.
Dear, I always wanted to have a little baby deer!!!
I've never trusted minimalist art.
Farwell fell-o-does.
say it to my face bro, i deer you.
Is the fawn smiling?
Hey Buck, look at this. It is the actual 'Deer Crossing' sign that caused a woman from Fargo, ND to have 3 separate accidents with deers crossing.
i love you

Not one his better known works
This one's my favorite. What's yours?

If these paintings were hung right I might like them.
Oh look, honey...it’s “Mommy Deerest”.

It’s late North Vietnamese. Dedicated to Jane Fawn Doe.
#goals
She said she was on birth control. Just what I need is fawn support
Oh dear! I really prefer portraits, that is giving me flash backs! I’m sorry Bambi, I think you need back to therapy for your P.T.S.D.
Humans shot the women away, we once had kids too! It's a jungle full of aging men out there!
Bambi's use of depth is too simplistic.

His perspective is very natural and realistic.
I DIG THAT MOTHER AND CHILD ANGLE
I felt great caution in my first painting attempts.
That was taken just before the 18-wheeler barreled onto the scene. Very sad.
