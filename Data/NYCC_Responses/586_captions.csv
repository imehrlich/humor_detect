Of course it looks alien to you. You've never used one.
I have a feeling they are going to treat us like dirt.
Left on Pennsylvania Avenue, big white house on the right. Can't miss it. Please hurry.
And they say life can't exist in a vacuum.
Wow. Aliens really do perform the jobs most Americans won't do.
As a matter of fact we'd be delighted to take you to our leader.
If they were highly evolved don't you think we'd see some attachments?
We can only hope that they're coming for our leader.
Eureka !
finally, an identifiable flying object
Something tells me this is gonna suck.
There IS a vacuum in space.
First, Trump...now, the return of the Hoover Administration?
Well, at least the boarding procedure will be fast.
Well this is going to suck.
I've always pictured the vacuum of outer space a bit differently.
It's a great service. I don't have to carry a plastic bag.
It appears to be hoovering.
I always thought they beamed you up.
If we take you to him, will you KEEP him?
Oh my God! It's a guided Bissell!
People of earth, lift your feet. This will only take a few minutes!
My God, it’s the Hoover Administration!
that's the last time I vote for someone who's going to clean up Washington
If it's anything like our vacuum, we're safe here on the ground.
Attention, Earthlings: Do you know where we can find a Type C bag at this hour?
It came from Bed, Bath and waaay Beyond.
If they're here to suck the life out of us, they're too late.
They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are cleaning people.
I guess space doesn't abhor a vacuum
Looks like draining the swamp has been outsourced.
Remember the good old days when the police would just conduct a sweep of the area?
I thought my science teacher was kidding when she told me there was a vacuum in space.
Collector to Base: Shall we take just the leader, or the two followers, as well?
Clean me up, Scotty!
Huh. Canister. I figured they'd be more advanced.
Well this is going to suck.
'They really are advanced. It's cordless."
Retract hose!—no alien can survive the moral vacuum of their leader.
Not the Rapture I had hoped for....
This is NOT how I envisioned the Rapture.
I swear, if you say "That really sucks!" one more time, I'm leaving you.
I didn't think anyone could live in a vacuum.
I always thought they'd be upright.
He's going to have to build a higher wall.
Get the small noisy one. He's clearly their leader.
It's a Hoovercraft.
I said Uber, not Hoover!
I thought nature abhorred a vacuum!
Take you to our leader? By all means!
Yep, just follow Pennsylvania Avenue down until you see the large white-domed building.
I told you we were just a speck of dust in the universe.
Somehow, I thought the vacuum in space would be harder to visualize
Wow, no cord!
They must be from a highly domesticated planet.
Dammit, Cassie, do you have to go berserk EVERY time someone turns on a vacuum cleaner?
You know, I kind of see where the dog is coming from on this one.
Ok, ok! We'll scoop it!
Watch out! It's the new GOP tax plan.
Take me to your litter!
Let go of the leash, Harriet.
I always thought of returning to dust in a figurative sense.
We are from the planet Trumptron. Our village idiot is missing...
Damn. This is going to suck.
We can take the whole ship down with a fistful of spare change.
Oh my God.. that's the new Air Force One! He really does live in a vacuum!!
Still not the biggest dirtbag in the universe.
I hope they're headed for the White House.
'Take me to your leader?' Love to.
It looks like the cloud wants more than just our data.
It's the new UBER. They pick you up whether you like it or not.
Honey, look! A Hoover-craft!
Any other time this would seem unusual.
Did you ever feel like a tiny speck of dust in the universe?
It's the new tax plan.
So much for space abhorring a vacuum.
Let's ask if they'll bring us back after 2020.
I just wish they were more friendly. They treat us like dirt.
Did I mention they're very serious about cleaning up after dogs here?
Look, it's the new Clean Air Act!
What did I tell you, life sucks.
It's the other attachments I worry about.
Worst. Rapture. Ever.
Look, an Identifiable Flying Object!
Why are you so surprised Honey? Vacuuming has always been alien to you.
It's not natural . . . .nature abhors a vacuum.
That's advanced? There's no grooming attachment.
Ever wonder where all that data sent to the cloud really ends up?
They treat us like dirt.
So this is what it feels like to be drawn to a higher power.
If their vacuum is anything like ours, we should be fine.
I wonder why they chose Washington D.C.?
With all that's going on in the world it must be nice living in a vacuum.
...take a right. Two blocks. Big white house on your left. Rose garden. You can't miss it.
Don't worry. Nature abhors a vacuum.
I'm starting to get Fifi's fear of the vacuum cleaner.
In my day they used to go door to door.
Actually, I can identify that object.
Oh no! It's the grim sweeper!
Well, I'm not surprised. We've made such a mess of things.
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is actually three blocks North.
Pray the bag is full!
They come in peace, with a one-year warranty.
Suck them up Scotty.
All those movies and not one of them got it right.
I hope they visit Washington.
We got the coordinates from your Roomba.
I always thought nature abhors a vacuum!
Well, that's disappointing. In the movies, it's always a ray, or something.
It looks like they came here to do the jobs Americans don’t want.
Now do you believe me? Life sucks.
This is gonna suck big time.
I told you we should have picked up the poop
Looks like congress just unveiled their latest tax plan for the middle class.
Let's ask if they're available on Thursdays.
First Musk, then Bezos, and now Dyson.
Looks like a 1940s Electrolux. They can't be too advanced.
Rather unfortunate that we named the dog Dusty.
I dunno, somehow I thought the Rapture would be more glorious.
All I said was The New Yorker cartoons weren't funny anymore.
They're from a different time, a different place, and on their way to clean mine.
I though nature abhorred vacuums.
Who do they think they're fooling? They're not even plugged in.
so much for the notion that nature abhors a vacuum.
I'm just saying, the Dyson would've looked more "space age."
Isn't there a twilight zone between the vacuum of space and the vacuum of earth ??
I will ABSOLUTELY take you to our leader!
Just take the one in front. He's obviously the leader.
Sure, we'd be thrilled to take you to our leader
Are we in that damn cartoon contest again?
Don't worry Marge, our President will threaten to destroy their planet.
That's weird. I thought life couldn't exist in a vacuum.
That's the military's new carpet bomber.
I dunno - I think a truly advanced civilization would have sent an upright.
EUREKA! No, I think it's a Kirby.
Dyson and Musk seemed to have joined forces
I'm sure it beats getting probed.
dont they usually come on thursday???
Quick, onto the grass - the attachment is only for hard surfaces.
I always knew that if we had a "close encounter" it would suck.
I'm guessing they're Republicans - they've alienated themselves by living in a vacuum.
Well at least NOW we know why he always barked at the vacuum like it was out to get him.
If we just hide in a corner, they'll never get us.
It's just hoovering there!
Suddenly Fluffy's fear of vacuum cleaners became all too real.
I guess they're here to drain the swamp
This clean air act is getting ridiculous!
They may be ruthless oppressors of a subjugated Earth, but you have to say they keep the place looking nice and tidy.
That's odd---the vacuum cleaner never bothered him before.
As things stand, what the hell have we got to lose?
It must be a Hoovercraft.
Illegal aliens, no doubt, taking our street cleaning jobs.
I told you we should have taken the saucer. We look RIDICULOUS!
So thaaat's how the iCloud works.
I believe they said, "Take us to your tweeter."
The hearth wants what the hearth wants, and our wants the fireplace ashes gone.
Yeah, Marcia, they can fly faster than the speed of light, but right now they're just hoovering.
Run Spot run!
If they do take you, hand me the leash.
Remember the last time we were abducted, Marvin? It was with an upright.
Hold on, this is really going to suck.
Take me to your litter!
Quick! Give them directions to the White House.
Can't we just take you to our leader?
We come in peace and also in an up-right.
It took 25 years, but that giant sucking sound of NAFTA is here now.
Looks like we missed a Spot.
Undocumented aliens. They clean your house for next to nothing.
Try not to look like upholstery.
Why do dogs always bark at vacuums?
Is it April 15th already?
Eureka !
It's a dirty job no one else wanted. They must be illegal aliens.
Walter froze, not knowing whether to sacrifice his wife or the dog.
Do you think their Mother Ship looks like our hall closet?
I think we're about to have a Eureka! moment.
Relax, a truly advanced civilization would use bagless technology.
Change the setting to "Sidewalk."
I guess it's dust to dust.
...and I thought that great, sucking sound was the death of democracy!
Mid-century modern is everywhere these days.
It's the prototype for Amazon's new drone for returns.
Quick, show your green card.
We come in peace to clean the shit storm.
I think we are about to find out where our missing socks are.
It's cheaper than the wall.
We'll take you to our leader if you'll accept our apologies.
That must be the mother ship.
We can't switch to Tuesdays. That's the day they do Venus.
I thought the vacuum of space would be more impressive.
Advanced life forms, my ass. They forgot to plug it in.
The White House? Next right.
I guess that's what a deus ex machina looks like.
They may clean well dear, but they're undocumented.
Oh no! The grim sweeper!
Hoover? Damn!
Your resistance is futile, once we find an outlet.
I told you that life sucks.
This is NOT how I envisioned the Rapture.
"Suck me up, Scotty" just doesn't have the same ring to it.
We are the Roomba. Resistance is futile.
Look! A Hoovercraft!
Looks like the IRS has started hiring outside contractors.
It's Tuesday. They are supposed to be cleaning the other side of the street.
This must be a Eureka moment.
Sure. NOW he's not scared of a vacuum.
I guess we are headed back to the Hoover Era.
It's Trump's version of the Clean Air Act.
They must be advanced. There's no cord.
So much for aliens have advanced technology. That's not even a bag-less model.
If we can just get to the end of the street, they have no power on the corners.
Elon really needs to stick with electric cars.
Maybe that’s the giant sucking sound from south of here ??
Hoover craft, I suppose.
Seems the vacuum of space isn't just a theory.
I said dial an Uber, not a Hoover.
Now I know why nature abhors a vacuum.
Hopefully they'll be making a stop at the White House.
Well...they always said outer space is an enormous vacuum.
This isn't what I envisioned when they said "the vacuum of space."
Wow. Cordless.
Advanced civilization my ass, I haven't seen a canister vacuum cleaner in years.
We are from the Planet Oreck
Politics aside, these illegal aliens just really get the job done.
Don't worry. Nothing picks up dog hair.
You missed Spot.
Oh sure, yeah, I will believe in climate change when I am sucked up by a giant electrolux piloted by real aliens...
Look! It's the vacuum of space!
It can't be April 15th already.
Hoovering? Oh, I thought you said "Look at that spaceship hovering."
I really thought the Apocalypse would be more dramatic.
Wow. Cordless.
Brutal alien overlords or not, they keep the parks immaculate.
I thought you said you emptied the bag after the last planet.
Dust in the wind , all we are is dust in the wind .
Yet another cleaning service exploiting undocumented aliens.
On the bright side, maybe these guys can drain the swamp.
Son of a gun, the fortune cookie was right.
Looks like the President outsourced the FEMA clean-up.
We'll take you to our leader!
Elon Musk is up to something again.
That explains the straight lines in the corn field.
Amazing. There’s no cord!
They come every Tuesday and Friday.
OMG ITS THE GRIM SWEEPER.
No one's ever gonna believe us when we tell them it wasn't an upright.
Figures the Mother ship would be a compulsive cleaner.
I would have thought they'd come in a Roomba.
It looks like a vacuum can exist in space.
This is really gonna suck.
Call them 'illegal aliens' if you want, but who else is going to do the housekeeping?
Consumer Reports rated it the best for any space.
Make America clean again!
I see E.T. phoned Home Depot again
If the aliens don't do the dirty work, who will?
Calling them dirtbags was just plain offensive.
One time I didn't pick up his poop.
Latest Trump tweet: Space aliens attack. They suck! Sad.
If it can suck up dog hair, we're buying one.
They'll never get us. I already see a giant Cheeto clogging the intake.
Actually, I believe they said, "Take me to your litter."
If we ask politely, do you think they'll do the living room?
Elon Musk's got nothing on that Dyson guy.
Well, this is gonna suck.
The president's new Clean Air Initiative.
That's not the way I pictured the Rapture.
That's weird, street cleaning is usually on Tuesday.
It's OK. They're here to drain the swamps.
Beats carrying those little baggies everywhere.
So it's true. Life sucks and then we die.
Oh, my stars! It's the Neil deGrasse Dyson.
I knew the undocumented aliens would fight back.
No thank you. We have a poop sack.
I'll bet they're undocumented.
We won't need that poop bag after all.
As a kid, I always pictured the vacuum of space as an upright.
I don't mind going, it's the metaphor that bothers me.
Following the merger of Goodyear and Hoover ...
I guess de-funding NASA really has created a vacuum in the space program!
Wow. When's the last time you saw a canister vacuum?
Take me a to your leader, he's got to be better than ours.
It's a Hoovercraft.
OK, now THAT sucks...
Mork from Oreck, I presume?
There IS a higher power!
We've come to help drain the swamp.
Windows..., do you do windows?
You know how yesterday you saw a cloud shaped like a duck . . . . . . ?
Any chance they're just here to clean up after the dog?
Look! A Hoovercraft!
I can't pick them up; are you sure you changed the bag?
I wouldn't worry, nature abhors a vacuum
Now I see why he barks at the vacuum
The Hooverians are benign. It’s the Roombians you need to worry about.
In space, no one can hear you clean.
Apparently nature doesn't abhor a vacuum.
Look! There is life in a vacuum!
You'd think an advanced alien race would be flying a bagless.
Their boarding procedure sucks.
We heard there's a mess to clean up. Take us to your Tweeter.
No reason to panic. Nature abhors a vacuum.
Take us to your outlet!
This is probably going to suck.
Will you go away if I promise to pick up after him next time?
The 4 legged one is the only one speaking out so the other 2 must be pets
You missed Spot over there
And that's why nature abhors a vacuum.
This is really going to suck.
People of earth, give me your tires, your spores, your puddled mattresses.
We tried sucking up their leader-but his hair has clogged the intake.
I'm confused the app says that Gilles is picking us up in a black Toyota Camry...
They say nature abhors a vacuum, now I see why.
Apparently, air travel sucks on ALL planets.
Where did you say you got those brownies?
I never understood until now what was meant by, "there is a vacuum in space."
Take the leader, and leave the other two.
It's Hoovering above us!!
I told you an alien encounter would suck.
H.G. Wells was right, Sylvia! Martians do live in a vacuum!
Is this how it ends, in a vacum?
As if the anal probes weren't bad enough.
I'm starting to see why Nature hates these things.
Whatever happened to "beam me up"?
This can't be real! Nothing exists in a vacuum!
Well, its either gonna blow or suck. Either way were screwed.
This is a lot easier than beaming them up.
Act Caucasian -- it's Homeland Security.
It's not much use without a magic carpet.
E.T. Clean home!
I don't believe it, those are the two cats next door.
I guess we're about to find out what can exist in a vacuum.
The White House is that way.
Somehow I thought they'd be flying in a Roomba
Stop barking - it's just a vacuum cleaner.
Nature abhors a vacuum.
Be calm. They probably just want directions to Mar-A-Lago.
At last, an Identified Object!
I've heard of the vacuum of space but never believed it.
They traveled through the vacuum of space.
I guess I was wrong, you can live in a vacuum.
I know. You've told me before. Space is a vacuum.
Do you remember that giant sucking sound Ross Perot talked about?
They said they come in peace...and they don't do windows.
I told you there was a vacuum in outer space!
Stop barking - it's just a vacuum cleaner.
Nothing to worry about. That's the wrong attachment
I knew the Dyson-Musk merger was a bad idea.
See Rover, now we don't need that little bag anymore.
They call that one a Hoover-Craft.
Can you bring us back in 2020?
Word is they’re an extremely tidy civilization.
There you go, another myth busted. I thought nature hated a vacuum.
Spare our lives and we'll give you the dirt on everyone we know.
Ironically, I once longed to experience the vacuum of outer space.
Quiet, Nietzsche, quiet! Nietzsche hates a vacuum.
The Vacuum of Space
This is not how I thought it would end.
Is it still a UFO if you can identify it?
That hypocrite hired illegal aliens to drain the swamp!
I had a feeling this day was going to suck.
Grab the leader, leave his poop carriers.
I bet this gets swept under the rug
It looks like we're being sucked into a New Yorker cartoon caption contest.
Now I abhor it, too.
You got the Republicans on one hill and the Democrats on the other and you're worried about two aliens in a vacuum cleaner?
I wonder how often they have to change the bag.
Its the new return feature on Amazon
I hate that new art installation. It's huge and it sucks.
Don't worry, an advanced civilization would use a roomba.
When they asked for our leader say 'Hoover'.
Huh! Dogs were right all along about vacuums.
It's human nature to abhor a vacuum!
I have a feeling today is going to really suck.
In the vacuum of space, no one can hear you scream.
They can't be that advanced. It's an Electrolux!
Just as I thought. We are the dust bunnies of the universe.
That reminds me, "have you scheduled your colonoscopy?
You hold the dog, I'll hold my wallet. I knew this tax reform thing was too good to be true!
How do you think it hoovers like that?
Attention Dog Owners: Pick up or be picked up.
I always knew there was a vacuum in space.
I told you life on other planets sucked.
NO, PLEASE, WE HAVE GREEN CARDS!
It's an OCD UFO!
The weatherman did say a low pressure system would be moving in.
Looks to be a Hoover Craft.
Huh! I would have expected an advanced alien civilization to at least send a Roomba.
Don't worry, those cordless models don't have good suction.
He barks at the alien Swiffer, too.
Don’t worry, honey, we’ll be fine—nature abhors a vacuum.
First he was right about the squirrels -- and now this!
Which one of you posted, "Illegal aliens suck"?
Strictly speaking, it's not an 'Unidentified' Flying Object, but we should probably call someone anyway.
They clean in peace
Don't worry. It's the wrong attachment.
As if Tesla and Dyson was a good merger
'Suck me up, Scottie" just doesn't have the same ring.
Good grief...."Wrong Swamp, wrong Swamp"
Seems nutty to me too, but he did found Tesla and SpaceX.
Their leader can't be any worse than ours.
It must be a Hoovercraft.
You'll never get me up in one of those!
I've seen bagged and bagless, but this is my first encounter with the third kind.
Illegal aliens suck.
Stand still -- we're safe outside. Nature abhors a vacuum.
No, they must be from the past. They asked for President Hoover.
Now I know why nature abhors a vacuum.
I don't know about you, but I really don't want to get sucked into this.
I bet that was the latest model when they left their planet
I agree that saucers had a more elegant simplicity. But that may not be our biggest concern.
They'll never be able to clean up this mess.
Hold still and pretend you're a penny.
Don't move, don't make a sound and whatever you do, don't litter.
This is really gonna suck.
Let’s take them to our leader.
Are you sure you called Uber? Looks like Hoover to me!
Boy, is THIS gonna suck.
I thought they'd have Dysons by now.
I knew Pluto would fight back after its demotion.
I guess that's more proof space is a vacuum.
Okay, this sucks.
What did you expect? Outer space is a vacuum.
It's the new Hoovercraft.
So this was the giant sucking sound that Perot was talking about.
Damn. This is going to suck.
Well, I guess my biology teacher was wrong. Apparently life CAN exist in a vacuum...
Looks like Musk’s joint venture with Dyson is taking off.
Quiet, Fifi. It's just a Hoovercraft.
Well, someone's got to clean up the mess we have gotten ourselves into
That's funny. It sure sounded like they said, "Prepare to Dyson."
Stop barking, already. It's just a vacuum cleaner.
I said dial an Uber, not a Hoover.
So much for being superior beings. My upright has more suction!
I told you there's a vacuum in space. Now do you believe me?
More illegal aliens, trying to clean up the place and take our jobs.
Thank goodness, I forgot to bring plastic bag again.
Man, we haven't cleaned this cage in eons, it's filthy
Ask if they do windows.
Invaders from the planet Oreck!
Why the outrage at illegal aliens? This is work that no one else will do.
Don't go. Please. Please take us.
Hey, Bleep...do they qualify as white trash?
Do not be alarmed, earthlings. We clean in peace.
Isn't it just our luck--a low-tech abduction?
Told you the weather sucked today.
Apparently North Korea has one too now.
Yes, it's powerful, but can it get in corners?
Somebody should tell the EPA that's not what we mean by "Clean Air."
I warned you about littering
Trump was right Marge! Illegal aliens really are sweeping the nation!
I think he said, 'Take me to your cleaners.'
Take my wife. Please.
All these years and I thought the cat was just being silly.
We'll take you to our leader!
They're Clean-Ons
Looks like another pitiful attempt to drain the swamp.
EARTHLINGS!--We demand you hand over your crevice tool!
Oh shoot. This going to suck.
Who you gonna call? Dustbusters.
What makes you so sure the aliens are female?
We're hosed.
I'd feel much better if you'd stop singing "We're just dust in the wind"
I told you not to name him Scotty. Now every alien in town is trying to beam him up.
Suddenly, Fido's overreaction to vacuums took on an ominous foreboding.
You haven’t heard? Elon Musk was appointed head of ICE.
Whatever happened to blinding white lights and tractor beams?
I always thought "cleaning up the city" was just an expression.
Seriously, Rex - what will you do with it if you catch it?
Now THIS is fake news...
They should invade the kids’ room first.
The Clean Air Act is sweeping the country!
They did wonders with Times Square.
It's the most advanced technology in the universe, yet it's still less expensive than a Dyson.
Don't panic--it's just a Hoover-craft.
It may just be part of a new show at MoMA.
I downloaded the uber-scooper app.
That reminds me--did you turn off the iron?
Guess this ends the crop circles debate.
No Mork, look closely -- it's a Labradoodle, hypoallergenic and won't shed!
All we are is dust in the wind.
It seems like a more advanced species would have a Bissell.
I thought they’d beam us up, not clean us up!
If those guys are looking for dirt they need to fly over the White House.
Don't be alarmed. They returned to take Trump back.
In space, no one can hear you clean.
I dunno. I guess I'd just assumed it'd be more like a Roomba.
Is there nothing Elon Musk won't try?
Concrete proof that space is a vacuum!
Maybe nature doesn't abhor a vacuum after all?
Blimey, it's a Hoovercraft!
So, is Dyson working for Musk now?
Nah, we’ll be fine. Stupid aliens chose one of those wide nozzle attachments that never picks up anything.
Wow, I thought The Rapture would look different.
I guess there really is a vacuum in space
So that's how they do it! Abduction by suction.
I thought it was a metaphor too.
The anachronism of a cordless Electrolux was lost on the soon to be abductees.
OH MY-- Marvin! Quick! Hold your toupe!
Run in a circle. It drives them crazy.
Is that the Leader Ship vacuum?
They'll never get us with that attachment.
I think we're near the Church of Appliantology.
Go for the four-legged one. They are smarter!
Oh, great, now Rex will be scared of spaceships too.
Cool! A vintage Electrolux. I knew they'd come back.
Dyson announces an electric car. Hoover, not to be outdone...
I miss the old anal probes.
So that's the giant sucking sound.
Not what I pictured when I read about the deep vacuum of space.
Oh look, Harvey! Retro aliens!
Take us to your carpet!
It's The Good Housekeeping blimp!
It's some sort of Hoovercraft.
Omigod!! HEPA, someone HEPA!
Take the vocal one, it's the intelligent species.
At last, Skippy's warnings had come true.
Well, this will give you some perspective on our place in the universe.
I told you, we're nothing more than specs of dust in the universe.
Oh no, a Hoover-craft.
It was either this or we build a wall and make them pay for it.
no sense in barking Fido, sound doesn't travel in a vacuum
Take us to your carpet!
Oh look...a Hoover craft!
You hang onto the dog.........we'll take care of the poop.
We’ve got enough human samples, get the dog.
Amazon drones drop off orders and Hoovercraft suck up returns.
Be careful, it's Hoovering!
Try the human attachment
Oh no, a Hoover-craft.
That's what clean energy looks like!
I think it's a hoover craft
I'm all for cleaning up the environment, but this just sucks.
They take air pollution seriously here.
Whoa! I never expected the Rapture to look like this!
Just don't pick up that furry thing! I'm still picking hairs off the sofa from the last one.
Look its a hoovercraft!
Hoover? Damn!
I didn't know Amazon had moved past drones.
Looks like your mother's loose again.
What's that hoovering above us?
Who would you rather have with sweeping powers ? Aliens or ICE ?
Well, at least we won't have to go to your mom's place for Thanksgiving.
It's about time somebody got around to cleaning up the neighborhood.
Next time, we pay the upcharge for the tractor beam.
I'd always heard there is a vacuum in space...
I hear it works great on flying carpets.
I'LL GO ON THE PAPER! I'LL GO ON THE PAPER!
Relax, they're here for the carbon dioxide.
I finally understand why he barks at these things.
Their technology sucks.
No - wait. Sound and hair seemed to match the description of their leader. But it's a dog.
Easy, boy. It just wants to sniff your butt.
All this time, Buddy was trying to warn us.
There's only one astrophysicist who can explain this. Call Neil deGrasse Dyson.
Don't worry. It's just Amazon's new package return initiative.
Well, President Hoover is dead, but if you wanna just go ahead and take the current guy...
At least it's not the anal probe.
Makes sense. Space is a vacuum.
Thanks. We forgot the poop bag."
I told you illegal aliens aren't taking jobs you'd want to do.
I get the feeling we're gonna Dyson.
Wait 'til he finds out the pilots are squirrels.
Your mother again?
They said they were gonna clean this city up, but it looks like they outsourced the contract
The North Koreans won't know what hit them.
Relax, it's not even plugged in!
They specialize in cleaning flying carpets.
That's gonna suck.
I don't know why, but I abhor this vacuum.
Let them have the dog.
I always assumed our ascension would be less mechanical.
There goes the neighborhood.
Must be a Jehoovers Witness
Man, they must have some extension cord.
That reminds me--when's your mother coming again?
We travel 15,000 light-years to get here, and no one can change a lint filter...
Last time we did this, it clogged the hose for a week.
I think Dyson has gone too far.
Something tells me this is more than a demonstration.
Did he just say, "Take me to your cleaners"?
Another group of aliens, trying to take our jobs away.
Look Marge! There really is a vacuum in outer space.
Remember that time ages ago when we were stoned and you asked me if dust devils had an afterlife?
Apparently the only thing from our civilization that has impressed them is the Electrolux.
And to think, I used to worry about being abducted in a beam of light.
This is not the rapture I envisioned.
Somehow, I don't think that this is the Rapture.
Bark! Bark bark bark bark!
The technology really sucks.
It's cordless- we're doomed!
Maybe Amazon dog grooming wasn't the best choice.
We already have a vacuum in our leadership.
Don't worry - its not plugged in.
Well this just sucks.
That reminds me, the cleaning lady comes tomorrow.
So much for advanced civilizations.
I'm taking Rex's side on this one.
This is not how I thought the Rapture would go down.
Just when I thought 2017 couldn't suck any more.
Look! It's the vacuum of space!
So, am I supposed to feel safer because, "Nature abhors them?"
Did you remember to change the bag?
We can't hire them for housework unless they have green cards.
Ah, space really is just one big vacuum.
Somebody needs to tell George Lucas he got it all wrong.
I knew first contact was going to suck.
" I said hover, not hoover, you dotard!
When they said space was a vacuum, I didn't think they meant it so literally!

We truly are just Dust in the universe!
Easy boy. Nature abhors a vacuum
I know space is a vacuum, but this is ridiculous.
Relax Fifi. It's just a Hoover craft.
Did you call Uber?
I know. It sucks.
So you were expecting to be abducted in a cosmic beam of light?
For you were made from dust, and to dust you will return!
Finally! No more poop bags.
No, we didn't say aliens suck, our president did.
No, no - it's definitely Hoovering, not Hovering.
UFO seen Hoovering over Central Park.
I read that Amazon was using drones for deliveries but not about its newest scheme for returns.
Our Uber is here.
They're draining the swamp.
In this circumstance, I think it is ok for him to bark
We"re getting close to D.C., I hear a giant sucking sound.
Oh great. This time you explain it to the dog!
People of Earth, this is your last warning. Curb your dog.
Seems as though spring has come early this year.
Guess we don't need a poop bag today.
That settles it! The climate must be changing; normally, nature abhors a vacuum.
I wonder whatever happened to Ross Perot?
Greetings Earthlings! Please remove all metal objects and electronic devices from your pockets and place them in the tray provided.
She barks whenever we vacuum, too.
This ending sucks.
Have no fear. We've come from Mars to replace the EPA.
Earthlings! We offer peace, prosperity, and clean sidewalks.
Take us to your Repairman
So, nature doesn't abhor a vacuum after all.
They must be light years ahead in battery technology.
As if things didn't suck enough!
OMG! Space really IS a vacuum.
I TOLD you Obama was serious about clean air.
The dust bunnies must be reproducing again.
That's the vacuum I wanted for Christmas! They just fly off the shelf.
Like most of nature, Rex abhors a vacuum.
It's true what they say- space really is a vacuum...
Thank God! I forgot to bring a bag.
Ever since they arrived, they've been treating us like dirt.
Well, that's one way to "drain the swamp".
I knew space was a vacuum, but I didn't realize there were vacuums in space.
You know, this time, the dog might be right.
Well, we did vote for a mayor who would clean up the city.
This just proves my point. Air travel sucks.
There's that giant sucking sound again...
Did we forget the pooper scooper again?
Do you think you could visit my house first?
Twenty bucks says the crew look like dust bunnies
This is gonna suck big time.
Man, the vacuum of space is nowhere near as dramatic as it's portrayed in the movies.
Look! Female aliens!
So this is the new Environmental Protection Agency?
This is going to suck.
It's like they are living outside of a vacuum...
Are you sure the dog poo app is safe?
Honestly, I thought the vacuum of space would be a bit bigger.
I thought the rapture would happen differently.
So not how I envisioned my eureka moment!
Yes, but the Dysonnians are much more advanced.
On the other hand, how much worse could it really be?
I'm bored. Let's go for it.
Advanced culture? Its not even a Dyson?
You said a little exercise wouldn't kill me.
I guess what they fly is called a Hoovercraft.
Their universe must be stuck in the 50’s.
I've seen the future, and it sucks big time.
We're hosed.
Oh...Oh---The Grim Sweeper is coming!
Oh, my God! There really is a vacuum in space!
Don't Worry, They're just making America clean again.
What part of killer flying drone vacuum cleaner don't you understand?!
Is this what the dog has been trying to warn us about?
Elon! Listen to your mother and stop monkeying around.
And, suddenly, Spot understood the terrifyingly thin line between his nightmares and his reality.
I thought the 'Hoover Era' was over.
The vacuum of space is smaller than I thought.
You're welcome to refuel on our living room carpet.
They just never tire of teasing the dog, do they?
Well I'll be. A planet to planet vacuum salesmen.
It’s part of the ‘drain the swamp’ campaign.
And we thought flying on airlines sucked.
Obviousl,y space does not abhor a canister vacuum.
The E.P.A. is not what it used to be.
Wow, physicists sure misunderstood space vacuums.
I did pick up his poop!!
They're illegal, but they keep the city very clean.
So that's what the dog was trying to warn us about all these years.
Let me go, master. I've been training for this moment all my life.
They sent this to clean up our political mess
So that's where the Ozone's been going...
My God, they think we’re upholstery.
Illegal aliens trying to take the good cleaning jobs from citizens!
It's a job Americans won't do.
And it looks like a J. Edgar model, which is even more concerning.
I've been wondering what has happened to all the stardust.
So do you finally believe in global cleaning?
I never really knew what ashes to ashes and dust to dust meant.
I refuse to be sucked into someone else's drama.
So they stayed for a week.  Quit complaining.  My parents live five light years away.
That reminds me, are the kids coming home from college next weekend?
Be sure you vacuum behind the mountain
'Unidentified Flying Oreck...'
"Interesting... I always pictured the Rapture a bit differently".
Numbskull! I said hover, not Hoover.
If I had known I was going to be an intergalactic specimen, I would have changed my underwear.
And you said there are no more great salesmen...
Down there! You missed a Spot!
Sure, they're a bit noisy, but the streets have never been so clean.
So what is it, hovering or hoovering?
Ever get that feeling that you're just a speck of dust?
Take my wife. Please.
My mother had one of those. I always thought it looked like a spaceship.
Apparently "clean energy" was poorly translated.
de Blasio's clean-up-the-city campaign has gone too far!
Don't worry honey. Your butt is way too big to fit in their nozzle.
On the plus side, my allergies are gone.
I thought it was, "Beam me up." not "Suck me up."
Well I've always wondered what happens when you're exposed to the vacuum of space.
How much do we really love this dog?
We have a poop bag, thank you very much!
"Invaders from outer space? Well that sucks!
I hope they are just as inept as you are in in using that thing
Quiet Scotty or they may steam us up
I warned you about ordering vacuums on Amazon Prime Day.
Don't worry, Marlene. Wherever they're from, they're still just vacuum cleaner salesmen.
I'd call it more of a 'Hoover-craft.'
How far behind us is your mother?
You know Dyson could have made it more quiet and efficient.
Let's not get sucked into something we don't understand!
I remember when witches used brooms.
Well hon, this is gonna suck...
Global vrooming
Actually, you can live your life in a vacuum.
Well, it looks like the dog abhors it, too.
You would think they'd be bagless.
We can co-exist with the people, but for some reason the dogs hate us.
With luck, they've come to drain the swamp
Don't worry. That's the upholstery attachment.
I suppose you're going to blame this on global warming too?
I liked it better when the salesmen went door-to-door.
It makes a giant, sucking sound.
Take us to the carpet of your leader.
Electrolux finally got a military contract
Apparently, they have come to believe that dog poop is a valuable commodity based on how quickly we bag it off the sidewalk.
Like Nature, Fido abhors a vacuum.
"Vacuum me up, Scotty" just doesn't have the same ring to it...
Get the one in front - he must be their leader!
Huh... I'd expect it to look more like a Roomba.
When they said that space is a vacuum, I didn't take them literally!
I told you we should have brought the pooper scooper.
Gee, building a wall seems even dumber now.
I always knew an alien invasion would suck.
It isn't just nature that abhors it
That must be the vacuum that Nature abhors.
Do you think he was right about the garbage truck, too?
Their next stop is Uranus
I guess they want to clean up the mess before they take over.
This should be less painful than the upholstery attachment.
Yes, I suppose this is ironic.
Maybe the cat was on to something all along.
They're back. Apparently we've made quite a mess of things.
He always barks at vacuums and strangers, but I'm really with him this time.
This was it...The day Fido spent his entire life preparing for...
You can have my wife, but I'm keeping the dog!
I'm guessing it's a Hoovercraft.
I thought nature abhors a vacuum !
Wow, it's cordless.
Remember that space saver vacuum I ordered from Bed, Bath and Beyond..?
And I thought only Washington was living in a vacuum.
You'd think, wouldn't you, that alien technology would have advanced beyond the Hoover.
It's powerful enough, but doesn't corner very well.
Careful, you know what dog hair does to this thing!
I thought life under Trump sucked.
Aaron's Appliance Repair is on the next block.
I'd have thought they'd at least come in a Dyson.
This is a quantum leap for Dyson!
They'll never get us with that attachment.
The city has outsourced street sweeping again
My Grandma had one of those, but it didn't fly.
I hear it comes with a hundred thousand-light-year warranty.
'The Orecks are coming! The Orecks are coming!'
I'm having a hard time believing they came all this way just to take the dog hair of our pants.
'Amazing! I didn't think the invasion would be cordless.'
Their new ship really sucks
Somehow I expected more advanced technology...
It's hoovering right over us!
Is this what they mean by the vacuum of space?
Don't worry, it's an Amazon drone making returns.
Not again.
We've outsourced environmental clean-up.
I hear there's a serious penalty if you don't pick up after your dog.
Quicker Picker Upper or not, we called Uber!
How advanced can they be if they don't even have a Dyson?
Time has run out for us to clean up our own mess.
He thinks its the mail man.
FIDO! How many times do I have to tell you? It's just a vacuum cleaner.
I told you already... the bag is full
Oh, that? That's a Hoovercraft.
" Morning becomes Electrolux"!
Directions to the Hoover Dam? It's just north of Roswell.
All these years, I thought Rex were was just paranoid.
It must be from a very tidy planet.
Look! Is that a Hoover craft?
When they said, "we'll be vac," I thought it was just a Russian accent.
Beam us up. There's too much trash down here.
I think that this is going to suck!
Look honey! Its a "Hoovercraft"
There IS extraterrestrial life--Eureka!
The dogs are always the first to know.
Quick - get behind a chair leg!
H. G. Wells wasn't even close.
Fear not, Earthlings. Just looking for Hoover Dam.
For a UFO, it sure sucks!
I guess Ross P. was wrong. That's the giant sucking sound.
Take them to our leader.
Don't screw this up again: remember, just the dog!
It's hard not to get swept up in the excitement of it all.
Don't look frightened , maybe they'll just take the dog.
Just like the bumper sticker says : LIFE SUCKS AND THEN YOU DIE!
This could get real covfefe!
Oh oh. This might be my fault. I just threw one of their babies out the other day.
Take us to your Roomba.
Don’t worry, it’s not plugged in.
What is it with dogs and vacuum cleaners?
Finally! Clean air!
Bring it on dirtbags!
Down boy, if they were that advanced, it would be a Roomba.
Is this what they mean by the grim sweeper?
Show them the poop bag now.
I can’t believe they come in cordless now.
So that's the famous Interstellar Vacuum!
Please take us!
I think they've mistaken this for Washington.
Act Caucasian -- it's the HSA.
That science guy is right....... It is a vacuum in outer space.
Larry, suck up the four legged one... he's clearly the boss.
At least I won't have to pay my student loans . . .
Don't be afraid. It's just the Republican tax reform plan.
And here I thought we might someday be destroyed by a giant missile, not a giant Bissell.
Oh. You know this is gonna suck.
Don't worry, they've got the wrong attachment on.
This must be what happened to the cat.
Honey, can you see if it is set to "suck" or "blow?"
Wait...I've gotta to update my status from feeling "Meh" to "WTF"
I hope their anal probes are more up-to-date.
You used to laugh when she barked at the vacuum cleaner.
No climate control, but at least we have the Clean Air Act.
When the Republicans said they were going to "Clean up the streets", I pictured more police.
There goes the neighborhood.
This is what happens when you abduct the cleaning lady instead of the rocket scientist.
It's just a mirage. Don't get sucked in.
They want us to suck up to them
Vacuum me up, Scotty!
Don't worry. Your ass is too big.
Maybe if you ever did the chores, it wouldn't be so "unidentified."
I'd be more worried if it was a Dyson.
So much for the Rapture!
Darling, did you say hovering or Hoovering?
It's nice not having to carry poop bags any more, but this seems a little excessive!
They go door to door and are incredibly persistent.
There's that giant sucking sound again...
See, illegal aliens do the jobs Americans don't want, or are too lazy to do
This is what happens when you bring in outside help.
Just doing a little house cleaning before we move in.
I knew the rapture would come, I just couldn't figure out how. Thank God for STEM.
Quick, make like a sock!
I thought we were taking the train.
We've got three more years with this guy, I say we take our chances.
E.T. Clean home!
Their pooper scooper is light years ahead of ours.
Dang! I didn't know Castro had a space program!
I guess just poor communication after promising to clean up Washington.
That giant sucking sound? It's us.
We should never have left so much space junk.
I think we're OK. It seems to be smiling.
This is why nature abhors a vacuum.
I see they're outsourcing border control.
Don't worry. They only exist in a vacuum.
He tried to warn us.
Next thing you know, he'll be draining the swamp and tweeting about it.
My first UFO sighting and it kind of sucks.
Don't they know that none of us lives in a vacuum, Martha?
Quick, quick, under the rug!
I think we're going to be okay, here. That's an old model.
Oh great. Just when I thought this day couldn't suck any more.
They've come a long way since the door to door salesmen.
And we can be your masters for only twelve easy payments!
Apropos spaceships, that one sucks.
Look its a hoovercraft!
Wait, do vacuums work in space?
Think they'll leave us alone if we let them have the dog?
It's the vacuum of space.
The outer space vacuum theory was not a hoax.
If it's bagless we've got a shot.
You can't hear it because there is no sound in the vacuum of space.
What's this? I'm still not comfortable with drones.
I really pictured the Rapture differently
I remember my science teacher saying there was a vacuum in space.... Maybe this is it..
This won't do much to quell his fear of the vacuum.
I found three more ugly flightless organisms for the collection!
After 88 years of travel we finally made it. Take us to your leader, we heard he's one of us!
"I've always heard that there's a vacuum in outer space".
It's just a Department of Offensive Tactics Alien Removal Device., an old D.O.T.A.R.D.
You thought they abduct people with tractor beams? You watch too many movies.
Just like I told you when we left our planet, their dogs are scared of vacuums.
Carl Sagan was right!

Easy, boy, it's just a political vacuum.
Elon Musk's Department of Sanitation.
I've seen my share of UFOs, but that's a big sucker!
This isn't what I pictured when you said "vacuum of leadership".
No point in calling it in. They'll just sweep it under the rug.
Well, the afterlife might suck too.
There's a vacuum in our lives.
Wake up, Rover! You're having a nightmare!
Would you mind directing me to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave?
I've always heard there was a vacuum in space.
Now I see why nature abhors a vacuum.
so long, suckers...
I guess there is life in a vacuum.
It turns out the dog was trying to warn us.
I TOLD you, when you go after more than one, they get stuck in the tube!
Well, that really sucks.
Didn't the previous alien invaders use uprights?
There it is again, that crazy infomercial I was telling you about!
Okay Rex......you can bark at THAT vacuum.
Eureka!" "No, I think it's a Hoover.
I liked it better when aliens just probed us.
I always heard space was a vacuum. But this is not what I pictured!
If they clean up the mess in Washington as well, they can stay.
Looks like the physicists were right about the vacuum of space beyond our atmosphere.
I guess they haven't heard that nature abhors a vacuum.
I thought nothing could live in the vacuum of space.
Oh No!!! We forgot the poop bag!
Finally, one that will pick up dog hair.

At least it solves the Amelia Earhart mystery...

What's that hoovering above us?
Relax. It's just a wet/dry vac to drain the swamp.
I told you, the dog suit was fooling no one. Let Roomba go home.
Save yourself and the dog, I'll try to clog the hose!
Last time we were abducted it was so much more glamorous.
They must be from the planet Electrolux.
Great...now we're being invaded by aliens with OCD.
They can't suck anymore than our current leader
Apparently, we need a roof, not a wall.
All we are is dust in the wind.
Yes, to them we're just dust in the wind.
Don't worry - its not plugged in.
"Oh look, I pictured the rapture differently".
Honey, when I said get a vacuum that's out of this world, I didn't mean it like this.
They don't ever do under the bridges.
Yeah, he's always barked at vacuum cleaners, but this time he may be right
Wait! They told us we couldn't bring home another dog.
It was one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind, and a bunch of dirty footprints for everyone else!
Do you think they can remove dog hair off of suede?
You're saying it wrong. It's "hovering," not "hoovering." "Hoovering" is something Brits do. Be quiet, Sparky.
They've sure improved on their abduction devices.
Seven light years just to show up every second Thursday?
Well... if they can't "drain the swamp" they might as well "vaccume the sidewalk"
Remember, we only want the dog, no more humans!
Well, that sure sucks.
No thanks, we already have a Roomba.
I thought that Nature abhorred a vacuum!
How advanced could they be? It's not a Dyson.
They call it a Hoovercraft.
It's used to clean flying carpets.
Don't worry. It's just a Hoovercraft.
Grab the dog, Millie. That giant sucking sound means we're getting too close to the border.

They stole our technology!
He prefers to be brushed.
Sweeping change is here.
Ask Elon Musk.
Can you direct us to the Hoover Dam?
Suck me up, Scottie!
Well! they are going to have to settle for "we came; we saw; we vacuumed up."
Take us to your dust bunnies!
Take us to your Oreck.
And you said the Roomba wasn't watching us...
It's a political vacuum. It sucks.
You know, I never imagined being sucked into the vacuum of space would be like this.
Now THAT is the dog's worst nightmare!
Excellent timing, we've forgotten to bring a baggie!
Well, that sucks.
You can't say it isn't a novel way of cleaning up Washington.
Well, there you have it. Aliens suck.
Trump is looking for some supporters!
Well, we could use a clean start.
Say what you want but believe me when I say nothing can suck worse than living here after the last election.
I thought they would be an advanced civilization, but that’s not even a Dyson.
We're safe- It's not plugged in.
It can't be that intelligent, it's not bagless.
It's OK. They're on the way to Washington!
Let’s hope they’re just here for the leaves.
Oh geez, this is gonna suck.
I've always heard there was a vacuum in space.
I just knew that if aliens ever came, they'd suck.
Too bad you didn't think of that before you named him Dusty.

This reminds me of the time Buster was barking at that mailman-shaped alien spacecraft.
Well there goes the theory that nothing can exist in a vacuum.
Retract! That's a virus with two hosts!
I thought my fear of getting lost in the vacuum of space was irrational.
Look! It's one of those new hoover-crafts!
The big ones will clog the hose.
That must be the vacuum of space I've heard about.
You're right, alien absuction makes so much more sense.
Would you look at that. I didn't think they made canister vacuums anymore.
Somehow I imaged them being more, I don't know." "Disc shaped?
Well, it looks like the machina ex deum has arrived.
I get the push for cleaner air, but . . .
Rocket man launches a pre-emptive strike
You’d think an advanced civilization would have newer equipment.

Look honey, that tesla guy got into vacuums.
I would’ve expected something a bit less ‘dernier siècle’.

It’s the maid en voyage.
Ross, I do hear a "Giant Sucking Sound!!"

We ALREADY scooped!
For When a Plastic Bag and a Scooper Just Aren't Enough
That''s all we need...another out of town environmentalist.
You were right. Running into them would suck.
I thought cloud technology was more complex than this.
Did he say, "take me to your leader"?
Say something so they know we're not dust.
Suck us up Scotty!
Finally ... no more plastic baggies!
Relax Martha, They only want to tease the dog.
They've decided to replace the EPA.
Now that really sucks.
Well, dust to dust.
Mr Sulu, set phasers to shag!
Did you order an Uber Scooper?
Relax, it’s an obsolete Electrolux.
'I think he's looking to drain the swamp.'
Now THAT's a great sucking sound!
This isn't anything like the movies!
'Remarkable to think that they traveled all this way in a vacuum...'
Don’t worry they’re only looking for illegal aliens.
Keep walking and don't act like a specimen.
Ya...like I said...life sucks.
So that's the great sucking sound we've been hearing.
"...and the best part is that Mexico is paying for it!'
Not them, the small one's hair will gum up the filter...
If it was a Dyson, we'd be home by now.
Take us to your Roomba.
Finally, someone is going to clean up our mess!
Man, they're really cracking down on dog poop in the park.
Well, this could really suck.
Quick! Wave the poopie bag!
I knew the Boeing-Hoover merger would lead to strange designs.
Sure it’s powerful, but how often do they have to change the filter?

You really meant it when you said the new pooper-scooper is out of this world
They've been cleaning up other civilization's messes since the Hoover administration.
Look at the design of it. No wonder nature abhors it.
Remember when street performers would just juggle?
Guess they figured the swamp wasn't going to vacuum itself.
This could really suck.
Where in the universe is that thing plugged in?
It's all right, Rex. We picked it up.
I don't know about this new street cleaning contractor.
American's developed that technology over 90 years ago.
Don’t worry. I left all the loose change at home.
Maybe we should have picked up his poop back there.
That is not the way I imagined God would come for me
She was right about vacuums - maybe we should investigate the mailman too.

I don't know- who was the first director of the FBI? What brings that up?
I told you going out on a day like this would suck!
Well, they can't be Buddhists....too many attachments
So what if I can't spell armageddon. It's not the end of the world.
Something's upsetting the dog.
Advanced? You'd think they'd have something more aerodynamic like a Roomba.
Oh, wow. This really sucks.
Did you practice your "Klaatu barada nikto"?
Suck or blow?
Let’s just hope they changed the bag recently.
It seems to be Hoovering over us.
It's ok Rex, the family with the corgi clogged the nozzle.
Now that's what I call a pooper scooper!
Fun fact: it takes thirty seconds to succumb to the vacuum of space.
Take us to your leader. We want to see what makes a planet suck more than ours.
This isn't how I envisioned our "rapture."
Wow"Musk"and"Dyson"it was just a matter of time.
Don't worry, boy. They're here for the cats, not you.
Take me to President Hoover!
I told you all along that he was warning us about something bigger!
Specks of dust at 11:00.
We abhor nature.
I think we're going to need the bigger nozzle.
Well, we can't say he didn't warn us.
Doggie Bag at your service!
Just get the poop, not the dog.
Darn. I was hoping for a bagless.
Graham, look! It's from Our Man in Heavana.
Just don't yell out to the aliens, "you suck!"
Amazon still has some kinks to work out!
Detect. Abduct. Deport.
Holy cow! It's an unusually fastidious object!
It's the IRS's new "Easy File" program.
The city outsourced the street sweeping department.
I don't care if it does ten parsecs a second. The ride still sucks.
We should've kept the promise to your mother that we'd fly out to see her.
Hey lover, I think that hoover in a hover is scaring our Rover.
You're looking for The Donald? Please!
Don't worry. It's just a Vogon VacuumCleanerShip. They only get bit parts.
Its 2017 and this dog is still intolerant.
Down Fido. This one will suck the life out of you!!!
Oh yeah, Musk said if elected president of Mars, he would clean up Washington.
‘It still sucks’
Well, as they say, "Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust.
What fresh hell is this?
It's the new Hoover XL44. They've increased the range by two light years.
Just capture their leader. The intelligent looking one in front with the four legs and a tail.
Don't worry, that model doesn't work on pet fur
Is this what the mayor meant by "cleaning up our city?"
Damn. The cat was right.
What will Jeff Bezos think of next?
They say you can't do anything in a vacuum.
Hoovertrooper: We don't need to see their identification. Scruffy: These aren't the humans you're looking for. HT: These aren't the humans we're looking for. S: Move along. HT: Move along, move along.
I heard out in space is a vacuum, but this is not what I expected.
When he said he'd clean up the city I thought he meant the other people!
Those aliens must have had a really tight budget this year.
I wonder if they move upright.
Damned budget cuts! This is sooo un-alien.
They have atmosphere - much better than living in a vacuum.
Am I hallucinating or is that really a 1937 Kirby XL DustEnder?
The poop clean up makes up for the scariness.
Get ready for a large sucking sound.
I've heard about these. They run on clean energy.
Jimmy, please put down the drone and go to bed.
Should I tell them their trunk's open?
I always said space travel would suck.
No, it doesn't seem unusual to me. I learned in fifth grade that space is a vacuum.
Wow! The "clean up after your dog" sign sure made an impression on them!
Elon Musk is at it again.
Wow, I guess he's serious about draining the swamp after all. "
Don't worry, space doesn't make a perfect vacuum
Quick! Curb the dog!
Remember when we had to clean up after the dog?
Look, they hired alien contractors to clean the planet!
Looks like they're clearing the clouds again.
It's like my daddy said, all great inventions come from alien technology.
I never thought those door-to-door salesmen would make a comeback.
Makes total sense. After all, Space IS a vacuum.
These alien invasions suck!
OMG - More Illegal aliens coming to America...
They must be from one of those planets with a lot of dust.
I would have thought Dyson at least....
Those alien spaceships suck.
They come from a very clean planet.
This time Dyson has gone too far ...!
Oh, man, that sucks!
And you thought yesterday sucked.
Maybe they don't want to conquer the world — maybe just pet hair.
U-F-Uh-O
We're Electrofuxed.
Did you say aliens suck?
For as small as they are you'd think their hose would be shorter.
You say you come in peace, yet you deploy your most powerful attachment.
I preferred the beam!
...Dual cyclonic action, washable HEPA filter, multipurpose brush, bagless canister, and the best warranty in the galaxy. In short, Gorath, they WILL be assimilated.
Be nice if there were a pic.
Suck it up, Mr. Sulu.
Bet you’ve never seen one of those before.
It's a Hoovercraft. It's taking the place of the wall.
They should know nature abhors a vacuum.
Sparky might be wrong about the mailman.
Draining the swamp
Bye Fido.
It was cheaper than “the wall” and they used some of the parts left over from the “Star Wars” project in the 80’s.
I hope you're using the pet setting.
Make sure the setting is not on carpet...we had problems extracting the last batch of humans.
Throw Fido into it and run like hell.
Take us to your leader! His tweets are out of this world...
They get a little bit greener every year...
"Thanks for bringing your giant space hover. But your gonna need a death star to sort out the mess we've made".
Ok. Now I get it.
You can have him, but you'll need the 'shag' setting.
You feel as guilty as I do for yelling at him to quiet down all these years?
Their technology sucks.
Don’t panic. They don’t even have cyclonic vacuum technology yet.
Lucky we're pro vaxxer.
I didn't think we were becoming that vacuous.
I thought he only barked at the mailman.
They must've heard the White House is a dump.
Looks like Donald Trump has asked the Martians to help him drain the swamp.
Yeah, it does seem that all the blockbuster movies are just about product placement.
Here is another example of Elon Musk beating the government to the punch.
Embrace the suck.
That filter wont last a day.
It's Amazon's new pooper scooper.
We should never have given them access to the Amazon Prime account.
I think it's a hoover craft
It's a bird! It's a plane! It's Scoopermen.
At least now we can tell the children what 'that sucks' really means.
I always wondered how they cleaned up after the Thanksgiving Day Parade
Why, no. What makes you think we're here to collect samples?
Definitely Ancient Aliens. The new guys would be driving a Dyson.
Uh-oh, this is gonna suck.
Careful! The nearest repair shop is 6.2 light-years away.
When they come in a Roomba, we’d really be in trouble.
Is it 'hovering' or 'hoovering'? I can never remember.
Earthlings, can you direct us to the Augean stables?
It IS true, there is a vacuum at the top.
I told you this town sucks.
This is gonna suck.
Who says we don't live in a vacuum?
Well it is "yuge," but I dont think its better than staying in the Paris Climate Agreement.
Wow, martians really suck.
They weren’t joking about gentrifying the place.
We are sooooo Electrofuxed.
They are finally here to clean up the mess.
But I like Kansas.
He always barks at the vacuum.
I knew we should have showered this morning.
I guess the city council was serious about outsourcing sanitation.
What will they think UP next?
So much for the "life doesn't exist in a vacuum" theory.
Act like nothing out of the ordinary is hovering above us, but on the count of three, toss ol' Duke up in the air, and run like hell, it's our only hope!
Quick! Giv'em the dog!
They did say they're cleaning up this city from the top down.
Tuesday, it's tuned to Mexicans, Wednesdays to Muslims, Saturdays to reporters.
Quick! Engage fur attachment!
So there is a total vacuum in space!
I hoped they changed the bag.
There IS a vacuum in space.
Some called Tom a clean freak. Others dubbed his stumbling onto the vacuum time machine an act of pure genius.
We are from the Planet Canister: show us to your dust!
You missed Spot.
Cool, no shower today.
Our leader responds well to sucking up.
Looks like our investment in clean energy is finally paying off.
Sure their technology gets them to other planets, but they're not bagless.
I was always afraid of being left in a vacuum!
It's the Republicans really big - very big new clean air plan.
Look it's an Unidentified Flying Oreck!
Let's suck up to them!
You're right, this place really sucks!
They're trying to sucker us into one of those free vacation scams.
It's just the vacuum of space.
Looks like his fears were justified.
You'd think they would have one of those new up-right models.
Goodness! What will that Elon Musk think up next?
You suck all the fun out of our daily dog walks, John
This is gonna suck.
I knew we should have brought a bag.
Don't worry. That's the upholstery attachment.
Let go of the Poop-Bag, Harry!
I guess we should of brought more bags
Did you have a return for Amazon?
Don't panic, that's the attachment for spiders.
The city can really suck the life out of you
We've come to clean the swamp
It appears that the cosmic dust and spacecraft debris is becoming a real problem.
This is what happens when the president keeps tweeting about illegal aliens.
And you thought he'd hate the Roomba.
I think they want to remove Spot.
We should have gotten a bigger dog!
It doesn't fly worth a damn, but it sure can Hoover."
How can we survive in a perfect vacuum?
Not what I pictured when I read about the vacuum of deep space.
Rex's rigorous, self-imposed, yet underappreciated, training regimen finally pays off.
What exactly does "suck it up" mean?
Do not open your wallet.
That really sucks.
This is another example of nature abhoring a vacuum.
Maybe your mother could use a change of scenery.
I thought they flew in a 'hover' craft!
Intergalactic clean up crew for global warming.
Ah, the sights and sounds of autumn.
I guess now we can tell your sister's kids what it's like being exposed to the vacuum of space.
I guess we won't be needing the pooper scooper
Man, that's one big sucker.
It's like Uber, but instead of dropping you off at a bar, it's a safer planet.
Why is it hoovering over the field like that?
Now I know what it must feel like to be an ant when we clean the house on Sundays.
Quiet, Ginger—They can't hear you in the vacuum of space.
See, when I said, "Aliens suck," it wasn't an insult.
Easy, Fido, it's Trump's EPA at work.
The street cleaners have really upped their game.
Finally a space program that intentionally sucks.
Take you to our cleaner?
I thought the expression was, 'when pigs fly'?
Is it a hovercraft or a Hoover?
"He's a giant suck up".
Donald Trump? Oh, he lives the bit White House over that-a-way
Gees, I wish Dyson would just use a blimp to advertise like Goodyear.!
Oh. I thought you said it was hovering.
Do we still have to clean up our dog's mess around here?
This is another reason why I thought we should take the subway.
I heard that they were supposed to drain the swamp but they've been driving around in circles since November.
Seems Hogwarts School traded their brooms for vacuums.
At least someone's husband listens.
How many times have I told that in the end life sucks?
Well, they did teach us that outer space was a vacuum.
Looks like aliens really do exist, Helen. But that beam me up stuff was a total crock.
I think Dyson has gone a little over board on its new vacuum!
They may have simplified taxes, but these collection drones sure do freak dogs out.
Very impressive, but on this planet there's only one 'o' in hover.
I guess drones have gotten less sophisticated.
No, it's an IFO.
Oh no, it's not an electricalux storm, it's an alien clean air act!
Heck of a dog whistle!
Why does Johnson always get the sleek, sexy robotic model and we get stuck with a 50 year-old Hoover?
Take us to your leader...on second thought we can wait until 2020.
It's a stealth North Korea missile.
Looks like they finally gave up on their fancy new Roomba.
I THOUGHT FOR SURE THE EARTHLINGS WOULD TREMBLE w/FEAR ONCE THEY SAW A REAL MARTIAN SPACE SHIP???
Huh, I thought Space was the vacuum.
Those have to be the suckiest aliens I've ever seen!
Hold on honey. This is gonna suck.
Take me to your leader, is it Mr. Dotard or Rocketman?
On the bright side, we could have been invaded by welders.
We come in green peace.
Stay cool - they're just trying to suck up to us.
Not to worry. NASA is testing off-the-shelf technology for Planetary Exploration.
Oh, no. It's the inescapable vacuum of space.
First, it's sweeps week, and now this!
Oh no! I told you we should have been scooping the poo!
Oh no, they actually do suck.
Surrender. Leave the barking furball behind.
Geez, why can't you just suck it up, Francis?
The dog was right about the vacuum.
Gathering specimens, sucks!
Don't worry. That's pretty old technology.
Not your mother's dustbuster.
Sometimes, walking the dog just sucks!
Is it because we're made of stardust?
Looks like we are about to be sucked into the dogs nightmare!
I always knew it would end like this.
No filter.
It's an Electrolux, but I think I'll keep the Hoover.
Hold tight, Percival - it's the enormous vacuum of space!
Schatzie was right all along, George! The vacuum cleaner IS an enemy agent!!
Air-vac: Science's newest solution to air polution
See, nature does abhor a vacuum.
I forget. Is that thing called a hover craft or a Hoover craft?
Laa-Laa and Po got their H2-Bs to drain the swamp with Noo-Noo. Tinky Winky and Dipsy were denied. Now they're called Teletrumpies.
Oh dear, looks like Space has finally figured out how to remain a vacuum...
I would have expected a Roomba.
It beats raking.
I think it is just another flashback from the acid we took at Woodstock.
Did you forget to return the order to Amazon?
We come in peace! We just need an outlet to plug this thing.
Didn't I tell you to pick up the dog poop?
The City outsourced the Sanitation Division.
Dust to dust.
And here I thought you'd forgotten our anniversary.
Marty, where we're going, we don't need dust bunnies.
It turns out aliens are cat people.
Are they hovering or Hoovering?
I hope they put in a clean bag.
Take me to your housekeeper.
Pooper scooper, phase II
Something tells me this is going to suck.
This is really going to suck.
Let's keep moving. That is not our father, J. Edgar Hoover.
Wow! I haven't seen a '53 canister model in a long time!
It was only a matter of time before Musk revolutionized dog waste removal
Take us to your First Lady, we want to meet Melania, not Donald.
Who knew that's all it would take to clean things up around here?
Darned vacuum salesman doesn't know when to quit.
"Hoover me up, Scotty" just doesn't have the same ring to it.
Got a penny?
I'm trying a new app for mobile groomers.
Aren't they supposed to use a big column of light?
Our air force will mop them up.
So that's what he's always barking at at night. It looks harmless enough.
This invasion ain't gonna end well for Legoland.
Wait until Neil Degrasse Tyson sees this!
No, Frank, it means "devoid of matter."
I told you that outer space was a vacuum.
I thought you said your third wish was to stick to a low-carb diet
On what planet do they put their disposable bags?
They're about to eliminate our carbon footprint.
I'm telling you--this is not what they meant by 'retrieve the rover.'
Help yourself to the pup, he's not sparking joy lately.
Ethnic cleansing is getting scarier then ever!
We're on target, Commander. We're going to pick up the 4-legged Leader.
Excuse me, could you direct us to the swamp?
Well, SOMEONE is draining the swamp!
Damn Hoover.
That's not what I expected for The Rapture!
You think they want to be probed?
Huh, space is a vacuum.
People DO live in a vacuum!
E.T.'s compensating for something.
Run! It's aliens in a hoovercraft!
Crap. It's not even a Dyson.
Do you ever get the feeling we aren't really real, just the figment of some weird artist's imagination?
Told you the pet attachment was a great idea.
I just hope that *this* one uses the right Hepa filter...
'Do you think it's the bag-less model?'
So now we know what happened to J. Edger.
Of course it's a Hoover, I said you hardly ever see them hovering like that.
I just know this is going to suck.
OMG - I thought you said you saw something "hovering" over Central Park!
where will they discard the filters?
Their pooper scoopers are out of this world.
Oh yikes! What kind of cookies were those, again?
Space really is a vacuum!
I told you to keep up with those vacuum payments!
Now do you believe in cleaning up?
We're off to a clean planet
So those are the alien suckers?
View of regular home vacuum cleaner as seen from tiny dust mite world.
Don't they know they're just stardust, too?
When Amazon says two-hour delivery, they mean it.
The shape of new iPhones is getting ridiculous.
Our house is missing.
A flying vacuum cleaner may do a far better job on the floor than our own old rickety machine.
Well the dog's not on board, but I think soon we might be.
There's one born every minute. We don't stand a chance
I told you there were aliens hoovering around.
All these years I thought the dog was crazy to be scared of them.
The vacuum of outer space has a lot more mass than they say.
Aliens suck.
I don't think I'm understating when I say "This Sucks!"
They're aliens from the planet Dyson.
So that's what happened to those millions of illegal voters!
ELECTROLUX MY ASS ITS THE N.KOREANS
No worries, we don't suck.
I wonder how often they change the bag...
Our city goes to great lengths to eliminate pet waste
Making the environment clean again.
One Martian's trash is another one's treasure.
No one can clean up the environment better than those alien contractors.
Now that's what I call a deluxe pooper-scooper.
That must be from the Hoover Constellation.
The new mayor sure has gone to great lengths to clean up our city.
Wake up, Toto, you're having a bad dream.
Take us to your outlet!
This "draining the swamp" idea goes way back to President Hoover
"Calm down Toto. They are here from the great vacuum of space".
Careful Shloom! This baby handles nothing like the Beamer.
Apparently it's street cleaning day.
Eurekans! They have found us!
Come back! Don't you know life can't exist in a vacuum?
I wonder what the carbon footprint looks like on that.
Wonder if they'd be interested in doing our carpets...
I got rubbed the wrong way and now I’m toast.
Ugh! More illegal aliens taking our low-paying jobs!
The Stanley Steemer merger with a drone Company is way over the top.
I miss the old days, when they used to scoop it themselves.
Looks like 'nature abhors a vacuum' just applies to earth.
Talk about sucking up all the air in the room!
Wake up Sparky, it's just a dream!
Don't worry. Dogs have protected humans from these for years.
Gaack! They've come back to make America clean again!
Finally, an explanation for that "giant sucking sound".
This explains a lot about why space isn't as empty as once thought.
Relax, they’re in an obsolete Electrolux.
What do you mean you heard space aliens were cleaning up their act?
That is definitely NOT a hovercraft...hoovercraft maybe?
It's the Tesla Model Y.
Bright side, we don't have to worry about dog hair anymore!
Arnie, I told you we should have bought vacuum insurance from GEICO when we had the chance!
Holy Poop Scoop!
Take us to your leader...or your nearest 120 Volt AC outlet.
“He always barks at vacuum cleaners.” (Note: the word "always" should be emphasized by printing in italics, or using a larger font size. I wasn't able to enter it that way in the caption box.)
I told you to never leave the scooper at home.
He was right all along!
Relax. Trump being Trump, they've come to learn how to suck.
Without illegal aliens, I don't know that urban renewal would be possible.
Stop! He's hypoallergenic!
The upgraded pooper-scooper ... and it'll create 20,000 new jobs.
It's an alien hoovercraft!
Rover, it’s not the same vacuum we have at home.
I guess it sucks out there, too.
What did Marty do this time.
Distract them with your laser pointer.
Word is they're from the Hoover Nebulus.
There's life in a vacuum! And they said it couldn't be done.
Woof Woof Woof ( "Hair on your planet and the big suck you flew in on.")
Did he really put the aliens in charge of cleaning up the swamp?
He always barks when the vacuum runs.
Honey, we've been waiting for a cordless model!
You're right Carol, if they're desperate for work, no wall is going to stop them.
That must be the Vacuum of Space.
Efficiencies are well and good, Zarg, but these new models lack the old shock and awe factor.
So much for the "they examine you and put you back down" theory.
Its part of the new program to clean up the swamp
I told you we should have brought a poop bag.
I've always wondered what the vaccuum of outer space looked like.
Relax, Fifi, they're heading back to Zlorb to empty the bag.
WOW............that's quite a pooper scooper!
Don’t worry, it’s jammed with a furball.
I know you hate cleaning up dog poop - but this is really going overboard!
We gave our Roomba an inch and...
Hey, maybe that explains global warming.
It's okay, Fido. I just outsourced the poop scooping.
Did you just say “This sucks”?
They’ve privatized the pooper scooper!
Looks like we won't need the poop bag
I think that this thing with robot vacuum cleaners has gone too far.
Don't worry.Those things never work anyway.
Look dear, that spaceship is hoovering above us.
I thought Electrolux went out of business.
Take the one doing all the talking.
It's Amazon's new delivery device.
See I told you we don't need to carry the bags anymore!
I told you to get a "Hovercraft"!!
It's the only way to clean up our politics.
I still prefer the old-fashioned way to get a colonoscopy.
Just when I told myself I wasn't going to be a suck-up anymore!
So, I guess nature DOESN'T abhor a vacuum.
I'm beginning to understand how the dog feels when we hoover.
I told you that those robotic vacuum cleaners were going to be nothing but trouble!
Well, this certainly sucks.
Another good news story.
It appears the park clean-up has been contracted out!
It's a new drone company trying to suck up to us.
When I read about "the Vacuum of Space", I just didn't think it was really a vacuum. Certainly not a canister-style, anyhow.
I don't operate well in a vacuum.
There's nothing to be worried about, they just want our dust.
I'm all in favor for new technology, but remind me again what was wrong with the plastic baggies...?
Relax, that's not a pet attachment.
I always thought I would go by an upright.
Well, it looks like the newly revised 'Federal Clean Act' is already in effect.
They're from Eloctroluxemborg.
I'm sorry I criticized your vacuuming
Let's hope its not their pooper scooper.
The Vacuum of Space
I’m not sure about The President’s choice of Mr. Dyson for head of the EPA.
Must be the perfect vacuum of outer space.
Well it either the rapture or we are about to be abducted by little green men in a giant flying vacuum cleaner.
Buster knew it all along!
Aeeee!!! The Tax-o-Vac
I hear the Nutronians just use a mop and bucket.
I told you my fears weren't irrational
You picked up after Fido back there, correct?
I think the dog is more frightened of this alien invasion than we are.
I've always been warned life sucks...didn't know that applied to life on other planets too...
Does this mean we don't have to pick up after the dog anymore?
Wasn't yesterday street cleaning day ?
And so the alien vaccuumers began their barking dog revenge.
See? I told you this city sucks!
This could get real coverage!
Look Jim, its the new Hoover-craft.
Oh look Madge, the Hendersons are early. Remember how they cleaned us out last visit?
It makes so much sense - all they've seen are cute puppy videos!
Looks like extraterrestrial societies have to put up with vacuum cleaner salesmen too.
If only they had invaded Earth in time for the dust bowl.
That reminds me, honey, do you still have that coupon for Bed, Bath, and Beyond?
My mother's sent then. She always said I'd be sorry some day that I didn't clean my room.
They're bluffing.
We're just cleaning the swamp, ma'am
Well they may be aliens, but at least they're clean
Maybe it's Elon Musk's prototype
But can you call it an Unidentified Flying Appliance if you're sure it's a vacuum cleaner?
I know we said we wanted the hair out of carpet but this seems unnecessarily thorough.
We don't live in a vacuum.
It's Elon Musk again, Rex.
Cheaper than building the wall.
Is this a sign that the future will suck?
sucked into the vacuum of space
This gives 'Today sucks' a whole new meaning.
I had always heard of the vacuum of space.
They must be shooting an episode of 'Doctor Hoo-ver' nearby.
“The sign did say no dogs”.
You forgot the doo-doo bag again, didn't you!
I said "Hoovering" not "hovering".
I think Hoover is listening in.
I don't see the Trump name on it.
Stop barking, Dyson.
These environmentalists have gone to a whole new level of cleaning up the planet.
Daisy,, like nature, abhors a vacuum.
We hear you need a lot of cleaning up down there.
I'm frightened too but let's just suck it up and keep moving!
Eureka Mae, it's cordless!
Where are we on Climate Agreements?
these new planes really suck
Wait! did you clean the lint screen?
I still prefer them to leaf blowers.
We really are headed back to the 1950's
I was hoping for a beam of light from a silver saucer.
I told you we should have just sent the Roomba.
Whoa, is that the new dog poop sucker?
It's called "HIM." FEMA's solution to Harvey, Irma and Maria.
So that's what Dyson's new electric vehicle looks like...
Well at least these refugees clean up after themselves.
Unequivocal proof, the universe sucks!
My goodness Harold if this is what it takes to show you how the vacuum works well then so be it.
Glad I finally upgraded from the broom, now we can just suck up Dorothy and her little dog too.
Oh no, it looks like the Dyson factory has been hacked!
Uh oh, it looks like someone has ordered us on amazon.mars.
I told you we should have picked up after him!
__I guess nature abhors a vacuum only applies to earth people
Cordless is the way to go.
For years they had an inside man at the Hoover plant.
Oh! Our dog was correct: God is the giant vacuum cleaner.
"It's called a "Pooper Swooper".
Well, Mildred, I think this really sucks!
Don't worry. It's a Dyson.
Just ignore it.
What on earth possessed you to list our Rover as the pick of the litter?
I mean, I like the idea the government is trying to clean up the environment but I didn't picture it like this
they jumped over the wall !
Boy, they sure are afraid of dog droppings.
This planet sucks!
J. Edgar, to you.
Look, it's a Vacuumulonimbus cloud!
Oh, they're just shooting the sequel of Our Man in Havana.
Are you sure were ready for a dog?...perhaps we can start with a high maintanance plant...
look Henry its the irs blimp.
Man, tax season just creeps up on you.
Hoover Craft, hovercraft, potato, potahto - there's still nothing to get excited about.
"They only need a small sample".
Don't worry, that's just Al Gore.
It must be in their nature to abhor a vacuum.
So it's true -- aliens TOTALLY suck!
It may be expensive, but if it gets rid of his fleas it'll be worth it.
This might suck
who's going to keep the streets clean when the new immigration ban goes into effect?
Hey, it's a job. Okay?
I kind of miss the flying witches on brooms.
oh fuck lmao
Harvey. Irma. Maria. Something different must be happening.
Janitorians! Give them your candy wrapper, QUICK!
Bitsy has never liked them. Now I get it.
I say we give 'em a shot. They did say they would drain the swamp.
Darn it, we didn't bring the human extension today!
Increase suction.
Is that Mike Tyson?
We're here to clean up after that four-legged monster.
Suck me to your leader.
Even space aliens have a better clean air plan than Trump's EPA.
Honey, your new Cordless Hoover just arrived with Amazon's drone delivery service!
Will it go away if we scream, 'fake news?'
I said to 'hover' not to 'hoover.'
Look! It's the new Tesla Hoovercraft.
A snout only a mother ship could love.

Maybe we were wrong to get an upright.
Oh no, not again! The last time I was gone for three years.
I could use one of those for the house.
Don’t worry, that model had poor suction
I think it's a decoy.
No. You misunderstood. I wasn't telling you to turn it on. It's just a figure of speech.
You see, they submitted the lowest bid for the mayor's "Clean Up the City" campaign.
I see we do not rate high in their esteem.
I guess that's what Trump meant by a "HUGE sucking sound"
No matter what universe you're from, spring cleaning is always in vogue.

And to think that he was trying to let us know all along.
It's amazingly quiet for its size, Elmer.
