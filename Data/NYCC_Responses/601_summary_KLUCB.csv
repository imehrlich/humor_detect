3230,2142,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,601,Even the cacti are leaving California.
3236,2142,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,601,Did you feed another one of those things?

3167,2142,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,601,Stan I get the feeling we are being followed.
3144,2142,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,601,That last tequila has been haunting me for a while!

3040,2142,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,601,My name is Seguaro but I really was raised in Arizona. We're not all drug dealers and criminals!
3026,2142,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,601,Step by step. Slowly I turn

2895,2142,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,601,Bad news. It's Creeping Americanis Cactiosus.
4938,2142,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,601,The new sheriff is less prickly than the old one.
4868,2142,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,601,Not to worry. It's an inclusive species.
4754,2142,4,5,56,65,1.2,0.06650621717611764,601,Honey? What was in that canteen?
4737,2142,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,601,"Honey, looks like the Dreamers figured out a way to stay in the U.S."
4733,2142,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,601,Hydrate! It's a dry heat.
4687,2142,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,601,"If we run faster, he might stop needling us."
4673,2142,0,13,52,65,1.2,0.05000000000000002,601,I think he may be a little prickly about what you said to him back there.
3805,2142,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,601,He says he'll let us go if we water the succulents.
4651,2142,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,601,Can I get a hug?
4525,2142,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,601,Your travel agent clearly said unbelievable desserts.
4520,2142,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,601,She is one of the 'dreamers' from Sajuaro.
4493,2142,2,10,58,70,1.2,0.056098109857700425,601,I think he’s suffering from prickly heat
4474,2142,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,601,I think someone's position is evolving.
4423,2142,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,601,This new coach really knows how to stick it to us!
4283,2142,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,601,"Honey, you could have waited to go to the bathroom."
4178,2142,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,601,"You can wake up later - for now, just RUN!"
3917,2142,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,601,Isn't there an easier way to keep our water supply with us?
4558,2142,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,601,Be sure to stay hydrated.
2843,2142,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,601,"Well, I say if it's a plant, it must be stalking."
1448,2142,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,601,"Pick up the pace, cactus. What do you think this is, a walk in the desert?"
2660,2142,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,601,"Wait, I have a thorn in my foot."
1042,2142,0,13,52,65,1.2,0.05000000000000002,601,"Saying prickly was unnecessary, but why did you have to take all of the peyote?"
1006,2142,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,601,"Honey, does Bill look different to you?"
903,2142,0,13,52,65,1.2,0.05000000000000002,601,"It's just a mirage, honey..."
825,2142,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,601,I'm afraid we'll run out of juice before it does.
798,2142,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,601,That prick is gaining on us.
683,2142,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,601,Head to that haystack; it'll never find us there.
626,2142,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,601,Quit stopping for water every five minutes and keep up!
583,2142,0,13,52,65,1.2,0.05000000000000002,601,He's gaining on us and he didn't even need to stop at the water station.
500,2142,4,5,56,65,1.2,0.06650621717611764,601,Maybe we shouldn't have passed up that last water station
413,2142,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,601,I told you not to touch the baby cacti on Karen’s desk!
305,2142,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,601,Get in his space and he gets all prickly.
284,2142,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,601,Westworld doesn't seem all that believable aymore
274,2142,3,6,51,60,1.2,0.06638357975446148,601,"George, do you have our U.S. passports?"
174,2142,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,601,Hmmm...thinking ..Climate Change..?
61,2142,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,601,The cacti? is after us. I don't think that's right.
52,2142,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,601,When humans become the primary source of moisture.
2790,2142,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,601,I think we can outwalk the cactus.
1077,2142,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,601,"I don't think it can catch us, but if it falls over it could be a problem!"
1101,2142,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,601,"Slow down Jerry, I think he's trying to tell us something."
178,2142,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,601,‘The sceneary here never changes.’
1371,2142,0,13,52,65,1.2,0.05000000000000002,601,"Let's get out of here; after all, our bodies are at least 60% water!"
1197,2142,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,601,"Keep going, he's still following us"
2647,2142,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,601,Hold your arms like This !
2604,2142,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,601,You tree-huggers are all the same!
2092,2142,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,601,I think climate change is real - look at Yeti!
2086,2142,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,601,"Honey, this is no time to argue the preferred plural form. We've lost most of them, and now it's just us."
1921,2142,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,601,No idea how it keeps on following us since we're not leaving any footprints.
1915,2142,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,601,Did you order delivery from the Cantina?
1716,2142,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,601,I don't think that's just a mirage...
2405,2142,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,601,Can we keep him?
1696,2142,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,601,I think he wants us to stop.
1689,2142,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,601,What was the name of that stalker girlfriend you had?
1678,2142,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,601,We raised him from a seed.
1633,2142,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,601,That's it. I am off the cleanse!
1619,2142,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,601,Lets double back around the ghost town then we'll ambush him.
1598,2142,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,601,"That reminds me, I need batteries....."
1410,2142,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,601,Either my Mescal tolerance is down or that cactus is following me.
1711,2142,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,601,"I’ve heard of jumping cholla, but this is the first time I’ve seen a jogging saguaro."
1396,2142,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,601,I saguaro someone is following us.
2915,2224,2,9,55,66,1.196969696969697,0.05801574004611869,601,He looks thirsty

3025,2224,2,9,55,66,1.196969696969697,0.05801574004611869,601,This isn't what I expected when you brought me out here for a quick prick...
3136,2224,2,9,55,66,1.196969696969697,0.05801574004611869,601,Is it a cacti or a cactus following us? I get them confused.
3286,2224,1,11,54,66,1.196969696969697,0.0538481719921703,601,"He's slow, but we will probably become dehydrated he does."
3575,2224,1,11,54,66,1.196969696969697,0.0538481719921703,601,"We could pour water on him, he's not used to that!"

3819,2224,1,11,54,66,1.196969696969697,0.0538481719921703,601,"Well, I think he's kind of cute, even if he is a bit prickly!"
4013,2224,2,9,55,66,1.196969696969697,0.05801574004611869,601,"Those pins and needles still slowing you down, huh?"

4799,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,Our new trainer is a real stickler.
4801,3205,2,3,45,50,1.14,0.06395151224456967,601,Look out! It’s armed!
4872,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,He's reminding us to hydrate.
4919,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,"Yeah, but, that water hasn’t been purified."
4928,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,We're not the only transplants here.
4933,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,"Let's go, slowpoke!"
2553,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,Huh--maybe mine was a peyote protein shake after all.
4993,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,Come back! I just want a hug!
5000,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,"You did leave the water bottles in the car like I told you to, right?"
4456,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,Will the Cartoon Caption Cactus Catch us Cassius?
4449,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,Just tell me already! I'm on pins and needles!
4434,3205,2,3,45,50,1.14,0.06395151224456967,601,Stop being a prick.
4365,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,"you can run, but you will only die tired"
3836,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,We're safe now; its run out of footprints.
3862,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,"Why, when I needled you the most were you not there for me?"
3863,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,"Ok, ok. We won’t make you pay for the wall either."
3864,3205,3,1,46,50,1.14,0.07004371812646434,601,Did you order tacos?
3868,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,Ummm . . . did you say that some saguaro could grow arms?
3906,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,"Uh, Don? ...Don?"
3926,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,And people think climate change isn't real.
3962,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,"Honey, why are we wearing pants and long-sleeve shirts in the desert?"
3971,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,But I do need a pair of those little bitty cactus shoes.
3977,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,just one hug!
4048,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,"Honey, did you just kick a field goal?"
4088,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,Well this is certainly a prickly situation
4110,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,...of course you’re not concerned...it’s ...of course you’re not concerned...he’s got that hard-on for me!!...
3786,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,"Prickly pear? No, there’s only one."
4150,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,“Quick!... it’s my ex”.
4193,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,So we couldn't just get a regular water bottle?
4209,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,I've got a prickly feeling that cactus is following us.
4237,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,"Jason, how do I tell him, that one good support sock really helps?"
4244,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,This doesn't change the fact you forgot my birthday.
4273,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,"..so you said ""let's audition for this vegan prequel to Planet of the Apes...."
4287,3205,2,3,45,50,1.14,0.06395151224456967,601,He's just looking for a hug.
4291,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,He really needs to lose some water weight if he's making footprints in the desert.
4308,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,It’s just one more sign of global warming.
4318,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,"Haha Cactus if you can! Sorry darling, it's Cacti..."
4331,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,"Jog faster,... Tiffany is catching up and you know how prickly she can be in the morning."
4343,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,Oh dear! You most go to my spa and ask for Alfonse. He’s a genius at removing stubble!
4356,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,Sayonara Sagauro!
4364,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,He wants to give back our carbon footprint.
4160,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,"Ummm, Harold? I think those peyote cactus buds we ate had a big brother."
2531,3205,2,3,45,50,1.14,0.06395151224456967,601,give me a W-A-T-E-R
4216,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,So it's true - zombie cacti is not just an urban legend.
2489,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,He never stops for water!
843,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,Just a little bit longer until we hit our heart rate goal.
851,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,You'd never guess by looking that he has so many stamina.
854,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,"Come along, next stop is The Cactus Bar."
857,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,Talk about the climate change impact!
866,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,Remind me to decline Professor Smith's next invitation to participate in a dry run
898,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,"Come On Long, Muscle Guy!"" ""You can do this!"
907,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,"I told you. Whatever you did, we're not the police."
917,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,"Your Prickbit says just 5,000 more steps to go!"
943,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,He's fading. Must be out of peyote.
974,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,"Hey guys, don't run! I'm lost too."
981,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,YOU WILL NEVER BE ONE OF US
1032,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,He's such a slowpoke.
1069,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,Finding the nearest moisture
1070,3205,2,3,45,50,1.14,0.06395151224456967,601,I have a prickly feeling on the back of my neck.
1072,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,You are not the Scottie we were expecting.
1089,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,"No, we can’t keep slowing down to look for water!"
1090,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,Don't look now but we're being followed.
1119,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,I don't care if the heat is dry---we never should have left Syosset.
1132,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,"So long, Saguaro!"
1151,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,"Honey, is Sasquatch a cactus?"
1153,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,"Simon says: ""Freeze!"""
1169,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,"""Don't look now but we're being followed by a tall, dark, hairy cactus."
1180,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,I think it wants us to wait-up
1200,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,"No Gene, plants don't like it when you spit on them."
1242,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,Run faster! The selfie boogeyman is catching up!
1255,3205,2,3,45,50,1.14,0.06395151224456967,601,"I think he""s saying it zips in the back."
1291,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,"Uh honey, I think we need to change direction so we don't get stuck in the desert..."
826,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,Okay maybe I shouldn’t have said this cactus puts the suck in succulent
790,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,These New Year's resolution joggers are such pricks.
786,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,"Run, Saguaro, run!"
752,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,Wow! He is showing a lot of spine by sticking to his new years resolution.
2501,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,"I know I need to hydrate but we are being followed by a ""Hands up, don't shoot"" protester or a cactus leaving a small carbon footprint."
26,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,I think he needs some water.
41,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,"I said we need to exorcize this cactus, not exercise it."
68,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,Are you sure Interpol doesn't know that you pirated that video?
82,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,Don't run! I don't bite!
97,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,Your sticktoativeness is amazing!
134,3205,2,3,45,50,1.14,0.06395151224456967,601,Take me to your Leader !
201,3205,2,3,45,50,1.14,0.06395151224456967,601,"We know it's just you in that suit, O.J."
202,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,I think he wants to be our jogging partner!
203,3205,2,3,45,50,1.14,0.06395151224456967,601,"Yes, I‘m spineless and want to stay that way!"
211,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,What a slowpoke.
239,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,I have a prickly feeling
299,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,"Step it up, Bob. I'm wearing inflatable running shoes."
1314,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,Didn't think Saguaro also can get inspired by Groot..
311,3205,2,3,45,50,1.14,0.06395151224456967,601,"Henry, when you said your friend might join us on our jog, did you say his name was Groot?"
361,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,"Honey, the hydration station is following us"
365,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,So this what we get when we ask the ship to beam up someone from Earth we can trust.
373,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,Faster! Desert Big Foot is gaining.
441,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,"Hey, I'm sorry. What did I say?"
463,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,Are you sure that wasn't peyote we just ate?
573,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,I’m afraid it’s of the woody variety.
581,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,Someone in a cactus suit is following us.
587,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,"""Simon Says"" put your branches down!"
602,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,Coach Saguaro is being a real prick.
605,3205,2,3,45,50,1.14,0.06395151224456967,601,You can't prove we overwatered the succulent at home.
621,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,"Hate to admit it, but I'm not thrilled with this Dali route."
661,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,Maybe it's trying to lose a little water weight
734,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,"Larry, your personal trainer is a bit prickly."
339,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,I think those footprints are following us.
1321,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,The wall is coming up ! head south!!!
37,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,Beam us up Scotty!
1376,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,I don't think we're wearing him out....and are you a bit thirsty?
1975,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,How sweet- he wants to be there for us if we get dehydrated.
1996,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,Great disguise!
2003,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,"Sidney, it’s another one of those undocumented Alien cactuses! Why didn’t our Senators work with Our President to Build The Wall, protect us and keep these things from illegally entering our country? Donald! Help!"
2018,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,He’s telling us we’d be better off going home.
2044,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,"When I said stick em up, I was joking."
2068,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,Slow down and let this prick pass!
2124,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,This peyote hallucination will absolutely make my Freudian analyst's day!
2157,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,Hey! Saugoro you guys going?
2161,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,We should have take more water
2172,3205,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,601,Doesn’t he ever get thirsty?
2179,3205,2,3,45,50,1.14,0.06395151224456967,601,Watch out! It’s going to cact-us!
2203,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,Last one there buys the first round.
2253,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,Did you bring water?
2286,3205,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,601,"""Maybe they should build that wall."" (underline ""should"" please)"
2287,3205,2,3,45,50,1.14,0.06395151224456967,601,Do you ever get that prickly sensation at the base of your spine?

3054,3506,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,601,"Maybe it's not a wall, but the new border security is innovative."
3018,3506,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,601,Where's ICE when you really need them?
2967,3506,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,601,"You’ve got to keep up, son, we’re not gonna slow down for you."

2849,3506,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,601,"Let’s not play spike tag, again."
3767,3506,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,601,Could you possibly be walking any slower?
3790,3506,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,601,Come on guys ! Just wanna giveya a hug goodbye.

3827,3506,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,601,"I told the big prick it wasn't a touchdown, I think he's obsessed."
4988,3506,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,601,A caucus of cacti selected him to catch us.
4962,3506,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,601,This must be the famous Seguiro.
4929,3506,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,601,My gut tells me it's the Aztec two step.
4914,3506,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,601,Can I trust that it just wants a hug
4851,3506,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,601,"We must be watchful honey, or this could evolve into a very prickly situation!"

4740,3506,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,601,I think the cactus is giving up.
4702,3506,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,601,You said it was low maintenance!
4698,3506,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,601,No Dear. I did not have too many Cactus Coolers at the hotel.
4693,3506,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,601,Anything can be a dildo if you're brave enough
4635,3506,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,601,Looks like you're not the only one who gets prickly when he runs.
4557,3506,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,601,I thought you said it would be REWARDING to dig up my family tree!
4540,3506,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,601,Darn! I was sure we lost him at the last tumbleweed.
4436,3506,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,601,The advancement of climate change.

4428,3506,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,601,"I've heard of creeping ivy, but not stalking cactus."
4313,3506,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,601,"It's following us home, but it doesn't seem cuddly."
4256,3506,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,601,"It's great to see you again, but let's skip the hug."
4226,3506,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,601,"If we pretend we're jogging in place at a crosswalk, he can't see us!"
4181,3506,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,601,You take him for a walk outside.
4105,3506,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,601,That cactus reminds me of an old boyfriend.
4095,3506,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,601,The cactus is chasing us...or is it cacti?
4068,3506,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,601,Now I know what gives mobility to a cactus: practice!
4056,3506,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,601,Don’t be afraid. It thinks that we know where it can find water.
3999,3506,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,601,"Step it up, we're being saguarod."
2753,3506,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,601,Code Red! Code Red! I can`t shake him!!!

3958,3506,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,601,"Drop your water bottle! I""ve heard they need very little water and we don't have time to hydrate."
3919,3506,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,601,"If you prick us, do we not bleed?"
3871,3506,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,601,Cacti Nationalist.
4335,3506,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,601,This spa is motivating me.
2744,3506,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,601,Wait! Wait! He's giving up!
1328,3506,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,601,He is not meek and spineless.
2725,3506,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,601,Don't look now...but I believe we have been detected by the evolved wall....
1676,3506,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,601,"Uh, honey. Remember that peyote song you were singing at the Indian casino last night."
1639,3506,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,601,"Sure, he's a bit prickly. But it's cheaper than taking bottled water."
1490,3506,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,601,"Oh, look! There's a cactus following us! Chuck! Really! This time I'm not kidding!"
1458,3506,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,601,It's a thousand miracles - they can go so long without water.
1395,3506,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,601,"He's saying, it's called The Needle' at Arthur Murray's'!"
1279,3506,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,601,Cactus boy want hug! Cactus boy want hug!
1270,3506,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,601,I think we’re over-running the cactus.
1209,3506,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,601,"Who ever heard of a cactus that can give you ""The Finger?"""

1722,3506,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,601,What a creep!
762,3506,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,601,"Hear no evil, see no evil but evil prevails!"
524,3506,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,601,Mexico will pay for that.
514,3506,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,601,The prickliness of slow-pace runners is unyielding.

1168,3506,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,601,I told you not to make eye contact.
1755,3506,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,601,we have to keep running; saguaros are protected

2676,3506,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,601,When you said we'd hire a discreet body guard I had a different image.
2589,3506,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,601,"You can take the girl out of the desert, but apparently, you can't take the desert out of the girl."

1944,3506,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,601,"In this heat, at least we don't have to carry him."
1957,3506,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,601,We said we don't want your stupid free hugs!

1998,3506,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,601,I think it wants our tequila.
1946,3506,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,601,"Yeah, he's slow, but he carries a lot of water inside."

1495,4166,1,1,37,39,1.0769230769230769,0.05672833888524614,601,"Ugh, tourists."
1559,4166,0,3,36,39,1.0769230769230769,0.04322703745761662,601,"Don't panic, I was a runner bean in a past life."
1561,4166,0,3,36,39,1.0769230769230769,0.04322703745761662,601,Who's this prick?
1640,4166,1,1,37,39,1.0769230769230769,0.05672833888524614,601,xxxxxxxx

3599,4369,1,1,38,40,1.075,0.055325377864931344,601,I can see this is going to turn into a prickly situation
3617,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,I think we’re headed toward more global warming
3715,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,"No really, the cactus is following us. Not fake news!"
3981,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,He's tracked us.
3896,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,"George, that perpetual feeling of uneasiness I have is definitely associated with the cactus."
3897,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,Maybe we could put him on a leash?
3965,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,George's father-in-law went to the extreme to make sure nothing EVER happened to Carol.
3811,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,I brought you into this world!
3540,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,When are you going to learn to take NO for an answer. #MeToo
3300,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,At least we know he doesn't need a leash
3478,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,"There's a cactus, After us."
3324,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,We've got to train a lot more. I don't want to get beat by a cactus.
3306,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,"Why don't we just hug him honey? He seems so desperate for affection."" ""Dammit Martha! You should have told me that before we abandoned the car a half-mile down the road."
3249,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,"You mean, ‘at least it’s not cactI.’"
3093,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,"Built-in hydration? Okay, that's totally cheating!"
3021,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,And you call me prickly...
2935,4369,1,1,38,40,1.075,0.055325377864931344,601,I read that they're crossing before the wall goes up...
2928,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,I thought it was just going to grow tall and not adopt runners.
2900,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,"I have to stop the 5K to Mexico, I can't jump that."
4024,4369,1,1,38,40,1.075,0.055325377864931344,601,"Hey. If you can't keep up, just stay here and we'll cactus up on the way back."
3535,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,"It's looking for revenge. Amazon said ""No!"""
4112,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,Honey if we hold our arms up I'll bet we won't have to stop for a drink.
4518,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,"That may well be, but I still insist you maintain healthy hydration practices."
4194,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,C'mon! I can get you a great deal on a timeshare. I'll throw in free tickets to the cactus festival.
2844,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,It's not moving fast enough to catc us.
4922,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,Hug-a-muga?
4907,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,"George, a Saguaro is following us. Bad hombre. Need wall."
4895,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,"No worries honey, t's just a dry run."
4849,4369,1,1,38,40,1.075,0.055325377864931344,601,I didn't know the cacti also danced at the Sundance festival.
4966,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,It makes me nervous when you feed it Gatorade.
4734,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,I can't help but think that I have seen that cactus before.
4630,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,Wow! You've been from Tucson to Tucumcari!
4598,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,"Honey, we've been made. The cactus knows we're not a mirage."
4593,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,"Don't worry, he is not a gingerbread man!"
4539,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,Cacti were also covered by DACA? Tuscon Women's March is this way... C'mon Robert.
4531,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,I think we're being stalked by a stalk!
4458,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,"Talk about being a prickly, I barely criticized his mother! And now he going to chase us? I told you all cacti are nuts!"
4405,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,I think he’s thirsty too
4322,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,I'm getting this prickly feeling.
4300,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,And I though this was supposed to be a peaceful weekend in the desert.
4285,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,I guess this neighborhood doesn't agree with gentrification either.
4280,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,"It looks like, Rudy, that we have two thumbs' up for what we're about to do."
4276,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,"Run, or we are cactus!"
4259,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,"When I said let's run in the desert, I said let's take the Camaro, not the Saguaro."
4220,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,"Wait, I just want to give you a hug"
4154,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,"Ok, you win! Tell us why are you following us"
2825,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,"Wait! Come back, I just want a hug!"
176,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,It’s playing ‘follow the leader’.
2761,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,"Remember, the key to these distance runs is keeping your fluids up."
1465,4369,1,1,38,40,1.075,0.055325377864931344,601,the cactus is trump
1221,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,"Thatta boy, stick to it!"
1172,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,"Honey, your mother has a new hat!"
1088,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,Geez. All I did was ask for gas.
1034,4369,1,1,38,40,1.075,0.055325377864931344,601,"we can't let it cactus- I mean, catch us."
1000,4369,1,1,38,40,1.075,0.055325377864931344,601,"Hurry up, slowpoke."
951,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,We should have manifested a less aggressive new year resolution.
945,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,Now you know what it feels like.
890,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,Good thing we've been training or I doubt we could out run it.
1553,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,"Hey Bill, do you think we'll find some water?"
869,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,"Beam us up? We have phasers, I say we blast it!"
569,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,Quick Charles! Its the newly discovered genus sub family!
427,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,Times up.
407,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,Honey. The cactus is falling behind again.
181,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,Are you sure the water didn't taste funny this morning?
137,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,"'Ir's the desert version of a fox hunt."""
123,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,I truly think they shouln’t have lowered the time qualifying standards for the New York marathon...”
86,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,"""Fact is, a cactus has tracked us,"" said Jack's sis."
57,4369,1,1,38,40,1.075,0.055325377864931344,601,Run! It's angry that I appropriate the Western aesthetic in order to appear trendy!
2796,4369,1,1,38,40,1.075,0.055325377864931344,601,I would hate to be raped by that guy.
735,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,This costume is very misleading. I really need water right now!
1565,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,We're being followed
1453,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,I told you to not water it often; now it's following us
1588,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,"I don’t care how rare it is, it’s gaining on us!"
2727,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,He's looking for the nearest Barber shop.
2724,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,The water station isn't until mile 2.
2720,4369,1,1,38,40,1.075,0.055325377864931344,601,..don’t look now but I think we’re being followed by the SEGUARO STALKER!”
2685,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,Beware! Stray too far from the stepping stones and you'll be 'cactus'!
2628,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,We're getting needled to move faster.
2620,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,"It's fine, you're supposed to retain water."
2259,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,don't forget to breathe
1575,4369,1,1,38,40,1.075,0.055325377864931344,601,"Honey, I think we are bristling up the natives..."
2196,4369,1,1,38,40,1.075,0.055325377864931344,601,What did I tell you about overhydrating?!
2090,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,I'm at a lose for words.
2069,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,"Okay, okay,! So a bleeping cactus is more trouble than a dog! Who knew?!"
2204,4369,1,1,38,40,1.075,0.055325377864931344,601,Don’t be so pokey.
1955,4369,1,1,38,40,1.075,0.055325377864931344,601,I think someone's beating the border wall.
1608,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,Don't leave...you should stick around.
2028,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,I told you to wear shoes.
1690,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,Tell him you fell for a prickly pear.
1788,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,You've got to start getting at least 64 ounces a day.
1645,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,Signal when you're ready for a drink so he doesn't suspect anything.
1928,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,I think we're being followed but I'm not saguaro.
1937,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,"Yes dear, yesterday it was an ""Oasis"" today a ""Cactus"" that runs, and tomorrow?"
1949,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,That reminds me - I’m making your favorite- runny cactus soup - for dinner.
1860,4369,0,3,37,40,1.075,0.04217636961434866,601,I get this prickly feeling in my neck that we're being followed.
1556,4464,1,1,39,41,1.0731707317073171,0.05399010639311867,601,I think it's more prickly than creepy!

3699,4464,0,3,38,41,1.0731707317073171,0.04117547077105886,601,"Don't look now, but I think we're being followed. OR Can cactus walk?"
3465,4464,0,3,38,41,1.0731707317073171,0.04117547077105886,601,I stand corrected: I guess there is such a thing as a cactus whisperer.
3461,4464,0,3,38,41,1.0731707317073171,0.04117547077105886,601,"Suguaro, Suguaro, I love you, Suguaro...you're always a step too slow!"
3116,4464,0,3,38,41,1.0731707317073171,0.04117547077105886,601,Well this one could use a good shower and shave....
1807,4464,0,3,38,41,1.0731707317073171,0.04117547077105886,601,Is it following us?
1532,4464,0,3,38,41,1.0731707317073171,0.04117547077105886,601,"Honey, the name of that cactus; is it ""Saguaro"" or ""Seguiro""?"
3760,4464,0,3,38,41,1.0731707317073171,0.04117547077105886,601,"Simon says, 'Hop on one foot.'"
