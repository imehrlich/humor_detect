Are you feeling any symptoms of withdrawal?
It's like you're holding something in.
Now turn a quarter to the left and cough.
Mr. Houdini, are you sure you don’t want to reschedule your appointment?
If I may be honest, Mr. Houdini, I would recommend retirement at this point.
I'm afraid we will have to probe further. Are you allergic to dynamite?
"You have no heart. have you thought about banking?
Okay now open wide
Sorry, it sounds like a combination of things.
It appears to be a combination of things. Physically, you're strong but emotionally I'm guessing you're empty inside.
I'm hearing a lot of deposit buildup.
I'm just giving you a check-up. It's the billing department that figures out how to get the money out of you.
Ok, I need you to relax, take a deep breath. And now think of the first 3 numbers that pop into that head of yours....
I think we can dispense with the iron supplement now.
Frankly, your options are safe sex or no sex.
You're absolutely sure it was safe sex?

Yes. Your heart is strong enough for safe sex.
I guess I don't need to ask if you're having safe sex.
I really can't tell. It looks as though we're going to have to open you up.
Well this confirms it. You ARE a heartless capitalist.
So I assume you're practicing safe sex.
No. When I said safe sex I meant...
I did my residency at Leavenworth.
Any changes in your combination since you were last here?
It's normal to forget your combination. Don't worry unless you forget what a combination is.
Well actually, the expression is "it is better to be safe than sorry" not "in a safe and sorry".

Good. Now open wide
Well, your problem could be a combination of things.
Yes, I am familiar with Houdini Disorder.
Don't be embarrassed, I've seen the family jewels before.
I think it's safe to say it's a combination of things.
I hear some clicking...but that's normal.
So, you mentioned that you have some questions about safe sex.
Next, I want you to open wide.
Sounds like you're having a hard time opening up.
You have an unusual combination of symptoms.
Exhale on the count of 38-16-22.
Sounds like our best option will be a combination therapy.
I assume you're still practicing safe sex.
I suggest we try a combination therapy.
Keeping everything locked up inside isn't healthy for you
Really? 36-24-26?
I'm afraid it's a combination of issues.
It sounds like a combination of a number of things
I cannot find any one thing wrong with you; I'm afraid it's a combination.
When you say you're feeling empty inside, do you mean that literally?
Now try turning to the right
Actually, a lot of men do this after I recommend prostate exams.
Your iron levels came back a little high
Well, my last patient was an open book.
The good news is, your health has taken a turn for the better, the bad news is it's taken three turns for the worse.
I'm so sorry. We don't accept FDIC insurance.
You really just need to open up.
Cough once to the left and twice to the right.
Do you know if your prescription plan covers dynamite?
No, this is not at all what I meant by safe sex.

Turn to the right and then the left and then the right again and cough.
I have good news. You can afford the co-pay.
Your have an upper repository tract infection.
You have the tumbler of a safe half your age.
Turn your head and click.
You will feel better if you open up.
If you want me to help I'm going to need you to open up.
As I thought, we're going to have to open you up.
Turn your dial twice to the left and cough
It's safe to assume you have a combination of problems.
Deep click...Good, now clack.
These days it's normal to feel empty inside.
Well, if you would just open up, we could talk about it
And would you say you've been having withdrawals recently?
Don't worry a bit. I'll have you cleaned out in no time.
It's not healthy to keep holding everything inside.
Practicing safe sex?
I'm sorry, but we're going to need to open you up and have a look inside.
You just can't keep everything locked up.
We're going to try a combination of treatments.
Try to cut down on the crackers!

We may have to go in.
Open wide.
Your symptoms aren't from any one cause. It's a combination.
Good news. You can afford the co-pay.
If this doesn't work, do you have any dynamite allergies?
Turn twice to left and cough.
It's OK to open up. This is a safe space.
Really sir, you can't stay in there until November 9.
You have too much iron.
There's only so much I can do if you won't open up.
Next I'll have you open wide.
And when did you start feeling unsafe?
It may be a combination of things...
Just give me two deep clicks.
Your heart's good enough for sex, just make sure it's safe sex.
And now take a breath counter-clockwise.
Turn your dial and cough for me please.
It's a combination of things.
Relax. A lot of safes feel empty inside.
I must advise you to engage only in safe sex.
And do you feel safe at home?
Do you practice safe sex?
I’m afraid we may have to open you up again.
I warned you about unsafe sex.
Don't worry, the procedure is perfectly... well, you know.
I can only help you if you'll open up!
Please Mr. Houdini, I can hear you. Try to stay calm.
My best guess is claustrophobia.
This is interesting. You're not only dying, you're also dead broke.
I'd say the family jewels are safe for another year.
Other than the claustrophobia, is there anything else bothering you Mr. Houdini?
How long have been having these feelings of insecurity?
"How long have you had that ‘empty’ feeling”?
Anything alarming that I should know about?
As your internist, I'd say you're problem is a combination of things.
Why do you feel your wife thinks of you only as a source for money?
Well yes, I did tell you to go to your safe place when anxiety hits.
We'll have all that icky money out of you in no time.
Everything sounds normal, but I'm concerned about your weight.
I'm just trying to get you to open up.
Frankly, I'm surprised you could even hop up on the table.
Well, we can rule out a sexually transmitted disease, as you obviously practice safe sex.
Ok. I'm just going to turn your dial very gently, and I'd like you to click when it feels right.
First, let's take care of the copay.
Your deposits show no sign of having grown.
Sounds like you've got a combination of problems.
I have some bad news, Jake. Your 9 to the right and 36 to the left are fine, but your 23 to the right is in really bad shape.
You were right to call me. It's better to be safe than sorry.
Perhaps 'go to your safe place' wasn't a great choice of words.
Just relax and open up.
You're hiding something from me.
The tests will confirm, but I'd say you are still impregnable.
Bad news! You will outlive your money.
I can't help if you don't open up to me.
Mr. Houdini, time's up, Mr. Houdini?
Well, it's a combination of things, but your main problem is that you're way too heavy.
It's most likely a combination of things
I'm afraid I'm going to have to refer you to a locksmith.
Let me assure you, I take patient confidentiality quite seriously.
I'm going to have to refer you to an auditor.
You're hiding something
Your numbers are very good. 36-8-14.
As your doctor, I can't really help you unless you open up.
No. Not so unusual, a couple of weeks ago I had a small car full of clowns come in.
So, how long have you struggled with these feelings of insecurity?
Are you comfortable getting undressed now, Mr. Baxter?
Try not to worry, we have several procedures available to us before we even contemplate dynamite.
I'm a triple threat. Psychiatrist, Cardiologist, and Locksmith.

If this is going to work, you'll have to open up for me.
Do you tend to keep things in?
I'm afraid it's a combination of things.....
I'm afraid we're going to have to open you up.
I recommend reducing your junk bond intake.
Turn to your left 3 clicks and cough.
And how often are you going through withdrawal?
You're very lucky. The piano you landed on cushioned your fall.
There are many therapies available. We'll just have to find the right combination.
If you want to change, you have got to stop keeping everything locked inside you.
Hmmm. Your heart rate is 36-11-18.
Mr. Houdini, I'm going to need you to cough a little louder.
It's safe to say, you have a combination of things.
Hmmm. Sounds like a bad combination.
Sounds like 120 over 80, then back to the right to 60 ...
If you want me to help you, you have to open up.
'I'm assuming you have the funds to pay for this.'
Yeah, we're going to have to open you up.
If you really trusted me, you'd open up.
It's what's inside that counts.
Well, it's certainly not an iron deficiency.
Sooner or later, you're going to have to open up
Withdrawal pains are perfectly normal.
You've got a combination of problems
No problem here! You sound like a million bucks.
We'll need time to get you to open up.
I want to run a stress test. What bank are you with?
I know I told you about the importance of having safe sex, but this isn't what I was talking about.
Clearly, you don't understand safe sex.
I think you're suffering from a combination of things.
So, when was the last time you opened yourself up to anyone?
Unfortunately Sir , as I suspected , you have a lethal combination.
Nope, it's still not safe to come out, Congressman Ryan.
Cough to the right, cough to the left and cough to the right again.
Still practicing safe sex, Howard?
I can only help if you are willing to open up.
Better to be safe than sorry!
you need to work on not keeping everything locked up inside
Are there any numbers you do remember?
I'm afraid I hear the clicking too.
And you say that he locked you in here with his tax returns and enough food until November 9th?
I'm hearing a combination of symptoms.
Take a tumbler of WD-40 and call me in the morning.
I guess I don't need to apologize for my cold hands.
Now open wide and cough up.
If you want to make progress you're going to have to open up.
46 left. 49 right. And 5 undecided.
I'd say you're well enough now to have safe sex.
You shouldn't keep things locked inside.
Your blood pressure is normal...120 left over 40 right.
Your heart rate seems to be a little elevated, Mr. Houdini.
Say the second number louder.
How many francs did you eat?
I'm afraid it's your clicker.
Have you been engaging in unsafe behavior?
And click twice for me, please?
Drop your tumblers and cough for me
I can't help you unless you open up to me.
I'd like to get a second opinion from a locksmith.
I'm going to run some more tests, but I'm pretty sure you're stuck in a safe.
I'm going to prescribe you a combination therapy.
I'm afraid we're going to have to crack you open.
Just a few more minutes and we'll see why you feel so empty inside.
It appears to be a combination of things.
Well, your condition is a combination of things.
I recommend cutting back on iron.
No one risk factor stands out, it's the combination that concerns me.
I know you keep a lot inside, but this is a safe place.
Yes, I can hear you, but no, my card was not the seven of clubs.
Will you be paying in cash?
Give me a nice, big click.
I've never felt this safe in a doctor's office.
I still don't understand how you could forget your own combination.
If I'm going to help you, you have to let me inside.
Turn once to the right, twice to the left, once to the right, and then cough.
I don't think it's serious, but we're going to have to open you up to be sure.
You're a robbery waiting to happen...
You have better coverage under FDIC than the Affordable Healt Care Act
Given your weight, even safe sex has risks.
As your psychiatrist, I can't help you feel safe until you open up to me
I recommend we try combination therapy.
I'd say the fact that you drove yourself here is a good sign.
I am afraid your cat is dead Dr. Schrodinger.
I believe that you are suffering from a combination of problems, but I can't really help you unless you open up.
This isn't what I meant when I told you to go to your safe place.
It's totally normal to feel like you're going to crack.
I can tell you keep your emotions locked up
I am trying to get you to open up.
It appears you gained a few pounds while in Britain.
I hear some clicks but no murmurs.
I took the liberty of removing your co-pay during surgery.
You really shouldn't keep it all inside.
I'm glad you came in--better safe than sorry.
Glad to hear you two are practicing safe sex.
Its a good thing you came in when you did, your pulse is 36-17-20.
[small caps to show she's speaking loudly] Mr Smith? Can you hear me? Knock once if you have health insurance...
It's very important that you're open with me.
I can't help you if you won't open up to me.
Yes, we accept cash.
You are generally healthy, but I think we should get some of your numbers a little lower.
Sometimes the only way out is to let someone in.
I am going to have to ask you to open wide
How did you get in there in the first place?
Turn 3 to the left and cough.
Any questions about safe sex?
C'mon, open up so I can check the family jewels.
You say you fell from the twelfth floor?

Now, inhale once, and then say the first three numbers that come to mind...
It might be helpful to open up once in a while.
That's not what I meant by practicing safe sex, Mr. Smith.
If you won't open up to me, I'm afraid I can't help you.

Cough once to the left, four to the right, and three to the left.
No, you're safe.
I need you to relax and click normally.
Well it's safe to say you're not suffering from an iron deficiency.
"Cough!" 3 times right, 16 times left , 20 times right.
I do believe your heart is healthy enough for sex, Mr. Houdini, but I still want you to read the pamphlet on safe sex.
You have to open up if you want me to help you.
Now turn your dial to the right, 2 times to the left, once to the right, and cough.
Do you know how long you've had this clicking sound in your chest?
I'm going to need you to open up for me.
I resent the term, "Cracker."
You'd feel so much better if you opened up a little.
Thinking inside the box appears to be your problem.
And you _always_ practice safe sex?
When I said you should go to your "safe-place", this is not what I meant!
Some of us are just meant to keep things inside.
Turn your wheel and cough.
I assume you're having safe sex.
The problem is: you're not opening up.
Turn your handle and cough.
My advice is to rest up and lay off the junk bonds.
It's to protect patient confidentiality. Now cough.
It’s not healthy to keep these things locked up.
I think if you just open up a little you'll feel better.
Well I don't hear anything now. How often do you hear this clicking sound?
Mr. Schrodinger, can you hear me now?
You have fatty deposits.
You'll feel a lot better if you open up.

I'm hearing a combination of things.
And when did you first notice this clicking sound?
How the devil do you expect me to do my job if you won't open up?
I'm afraid we're gonna have to open you up.
You need to come out. This is not what I meant by finding a safe place.
And how long have you been feeling, as you put it, unsafe?
When did you first notice these feelings of insecurity?
I'm detecting security issues.

It sounds like a combination of problems.
I can see that you're going to be a tough one to crack.
Have you experienced any withdrawal since you've stopped taking currency?

The symptoms you describe could be a number of things or, more likely, a combination of those numbers.
Hold still...
You'd be surprised how many patients have issues opening up.
I'm going to prescribe something more effective but less safe.
You're safe for the foreseeable future.
Good. Now spin left to 36 and hold it.
Turn and cough up the money, please.
Show me the money
Sounds like this could be a combination of things.
I will try but I am pretty sure only you can unlock your potential.
The only way you're going to make progress is for you to open up.
What's your safe word?
I'm going to prescribe you a combination of drugs.
It's OK, you can open up to me.
I think it's safe to say you're empty inside.
Think hard -- You must have known the combination if you were able to open the door in the first place.
I'm hearing you don't feel safe.
I know that! My question was, 'Do you FEEL safe at home?'
Now open up and say 'Aah'!
You’ll still have to get the shot.
Cough!
No, you're not dying. His tax returns would make anyone feel this way.
I can help if you let me unlock your inner self.
My advice is to not keep things locked up inside you.
Cough up some cash and you'll feel better.
I'm afraid it's iron lung.
Whatever is troubling you, it would be better telling me rather than keeping it locked up.
Your cash pressure seems a little high.
This is a safe place-you can tell me anything
Coffer.
Safe sex?
Now, take a deep breath please, Mr. Houdini.
For the last time, you have got to stop falling on cartoon characters.
You're gonna have to lay off the dough.
Hmm…safe but no sound.
You know it's not healthy to keep everything locked inside.
How long has it been since your last physical, Mr. Houdini?
Every since the robbery, I feel so empty inside.
Take a deep breath on 1-22-13.
In my opinion, it's a combination of things.
This time, cough up the cash.
It's not healthy to keep your feelings locked up
Everything sounds good, I think you are a safe.
And how long have you been feeling insecure?
You will have to open up for the co-pay, anyway.
Doctor, like I told you before: I'm not coming out until the election over.
Good news Mrs. Banks. you'll be delivering that little piggy back in a minute now
The problem is I'm a urologist.
I told you to stay safe,not stay in a safe!
This would be easier if you just opened up to me.
Are you still thinking about your safe place?
I would normally call a blockage like this unsafe, but you’re a special case.
It's safe to say you have a combination of ailments, but lack of iron is not among them.
This is odd. Most of my patients come pre-cracked.
I know the safe is a metaphor, Leonard, but it's also an actual safe and I can't get you out.
Try to relax -- it's my job to listen and help you open up.
How long have you felt this overpowering need to be safe?
Until we open you up, we have to assume that the cat is both alive and dead at the same time.
I think we'll skip the prostate exam for today.
I can't help but feel that you are keeping something from me.
I sense a tightness in your chest.
So you say you forgot your "safe" word?
Of course your secrets are safe with me
You can tell me. This is a safe place.
This is really a tough case to crack!
Looks like toxic shock to me. Are you holding any Deutsche Bank shares in there?
You'll have to be more open if you want my help.
It's not healthy to keep everything locked away inside of you.
Take a deep breathe and exhale large denominations.
If you want me to help you, you've really got to start opening up.
Well you definitely don't have any insecurities.
It's just stress. You shouldn't keep everything locked up inside.
Your tumblers aren't tumbling. Your locks are 98% blocked.
You need to be open with your doctor, you can't keep things locked up inside you.
Are you sure you don't want me to let you out yet Mr Houdini?
I hear you in there Mr. Davis. This is not an effective way to treat your agoraphobia.
It sounds like you have a combination of issues.
Relax. We can open you up safely and remove what's inside.
I think we're going to have to open you up to see what's in there.
Of course Mr. Johnson, but can locking yourself in really make you feel any safer?
I suggest you get more iron.
What can I say to get you to open up?
No, the election isn't over for another month.
Just as I suspected. Your irregular heartbeat is due to your high iron content.
I assure you, the iron supplement is 100% safe.
Good news Mr. Johnson! Only two more weeks and the elections will be over!
You will neve feel safe unless you unlock your inner self.
I hear you. It's a combination of things.
Sir, I respect patient privacy, but don't you think this is a little much?
Mr. Evans, you have to speak up when you're in your safe place.
How long has it been since you had a really good combination?
Please turn three times to the left and cough.
I think we’re going to need to open you up.
Shallow breaths, Houdini, shallow breaths.
Relax, you're safe here.
What exactly did you say to your wife?
Perhaps you could try to open up to me more.
You probably wouldn't even be here if you had practiced safe sex.
I specialize in safes because that's where the money is.
Try thinking outside the box
Ok,now open widely
It's not healthy to keep all these things locked up inside of you.
She wants to love you, but first you have to open up.
We'll skip the part where I use the little hammer to test your reflexes.
We won't make any real progress here until you open up.
Oh my God money really does talk
You do seem withdrawn.
It's not just one symptom, it's really a combination.
No, no Mr. Giuliani, it's only November 7.
Left to 27, now cough...
I suspect it's affluenza, but I'll know more once I open you up.
Have you been having safe sex? You're pregnant!
To be honest, I don't know how much more safe we can make you feel.
You're finally starting to open up
I think we'll need to try something different to unlock your past.
You're lucky you found me, a lot of doctors are real thieves!
I think with the right combination, we can see what going on in there
Just to play safe, I'm looking at a combination of things
Now that you're in your safe place, you need to open up more.
I see you have a combination of problems. Your ticker is off and your numbers are high.
Keeping everything inside really isn't healthy.
I'll have to refer you to a psychologist because I think you need to really open up.
You need to open up and tell me why you don't feel safe anymore.
So you feel like you're always tumbling.
Your wife seems to think you're keeping something from her.
And you think that working at a bank has changed you somehow?
I'll be prescribing a combination of drugs
"Just relax,there's nothing to worry about.You can open up to me.
I feel you are trying to keep something from me.
Yes, I concur...safe sex is always the best option.
Well fortunately it's not your clicker
There is a murmur that the Fed is raising rates again.
Don't worry, i'm not going to ask to see your assets.
This is so much easier without patients as middlemen.
The Real You is in there, trying to get out.
Instead of numbers, I'm going to recommend a combination of diet, exercise and rest. If that doesn't get things to open up, we may have to consider an electronic keypad.
To diagnose your feelings of insecurity, I will need you to open up.
Mr. Snowden, can you hear me?
Now, two full deep breaths to the left.
You really should include at least one special character or number
I'm so sorry, it appears you are impregnable.
HOUDINI CAN YOU HEAR ME?
I expect that you practice safe sex.
Fortunately for you, I worked my way through medical school as a bank robber.
I'd recommend dropping a few pounds-- just not from a second story window.
I think you have lock jaw.
You're going to need to lose some weight.
It sounds fine, but I'll refer you to an accountant just to be safe.
Sir, I assure you...we take doctor-patient confidentiality very seriously here.
Your heart sounds good, so I think we can go ahead and talk about practicing safe sex.
It's safe to open up to me.
There's no doubt about it, you're a tough case to crack...
Your symptoms are hard to crack.
I'm concerned about your BMI.
But you’ll suffocate before the election is over.
No. You're not imagining it. There is a slight echo when you talk.
25 left, and cough
So when did you last feel this insecure?
Your safe is secret with me.
You can speak up. This is a safe place.
"You don't have to play it safe with me, I'm your doctor".
In order for me to help you, you need to open up.
You know, you are a hard case to crack.
You seem to be suffering from a combination of issues.
I assure you Mrs. Clinton, the normal parameters of 'doctor/patient confidentiality' should cover this examination.
Your liquidity is OK but your tumblers need more exercise.
If you want my help, you'll have to open up to me.
Listen. You’re taking this whole safe space thing a little too far.
Ma'am, please just calm down and try to remember the combination.
If you'd just open up, you'd feel better about yourself.
Are you sure you've been having safe sex?
We need to open you up.
Don't worry you're in safe hands!
Can you speak louder....was that 6 right or left?
As I promised, this is a safe space.
So, you're telling me that you don't feel safe anymore?
Right 5, left 19, right 48. Good news, everything's normal.
Therapy will not work if you refuse to open up.
You need to cut back on the gold and take more $10's and $20's.
Take two aspirin, change your combination, and you'll be fine.
I would recommend cutting back on your iron."
Stop chasing the almighty dollar, lose 2000 pounds, and exercise, exercise, exercise.
Huh! You seem to be infected by the Root of all Evil.
Mr. Knox, I can't help you if you won't open up to me.
Funny, last week we just had a self-drive car on the couch next door.
Don't worry, you're safe here.
It's better to be safe than sorry!
...no sir, your FDIC insurance is still considered out-of-network...
I sense resistance.
My patients usually open up to me more...
No, I said, "Go TO your safe place."
I don't open up easily.
I assure you once you finish therapy, you will open up a lot easier.
I think you may be taking this HIPAA thing too seriously.
Regular check-ups are the best way to ensure you stay safe.
I'll order some tests to see if you have an iron deficiency.
If you're not ready to open up yet, we'll never get anywhere with your problem.
Mr. Houdini, did something in particular make you decide to stay inside?
Are you having safe sex in there?
Safe and sound.
Sounds like someone's really done a number on you.
I'm sorry but your tumblers are dry, your petty cash drawer is empty and you're overdrawn.
Now just relax; this is a safe environment.
Sorry--I forgot your combination, and I think I left a surgical sponge in there.
Try opening for me.
take a deep breath, and open up wide
I'm afraid I'm going to have to crack you.
I know you're in there Houdini, I can hear you breathing.
Can you please exhale for me, Mr. Houdini?
So your lungs sound fine, but I'm still very concerned about your safety
I don't hear the family jewels. Cough for me, please.
Say Open
No, you did the safe thing by coming in today.
cough and say 54 - 18- 29
Take a deep deposit.
But keeping everything locked up inside is kind of the idea.
I'm confident that we're getting close to unlocking those pent up feelings.
Frankly, we're afraid we have some kind of deadly combination at work here.
you seem to have trouble opening up...
It's called agoraphobia and boy, do you have it.
You present a combination of challenges
Relax,your safe with me.
I can assure you that your secret is safe with me.
Just turn left, right, left, and open wide.
It’s unhealthy to keep everything inside.
I can hear them in there, Mr. Trump. Your tax returns are weeping and begging to be released.
I need you to open up.
Just relax your tumblers and breath.
If anything hurts, just use your safe word.
I'm afraid you are not a safe weight.
You say you had the combo meal at lunch?
Yes, I can tell money is near and dear to your heart.
You'll open up sooner or later.
That's one of the side effects of withdrawal.
Ewww! The money IS talking.
Stop playing it safe and open up to someone.
I want you to know, you are safe to open up here.
You need to open up more
Paying for Medical School shouldn't be this difficult.
We need to keep working on trust.
Well, its seems the iron supplements are kicking in.
We can't make progress if you don't open up to me.
Certainly you can feel safe with me. I'm a doctor.
So you've been practicing Safe Sex...
You can't stay in there until after the presidential race, there isn't enough oxygen.
If only you had practiced safe sex.
How long have you had this feeling of being not safe?
This is not what I meant when I suggested closure.
Cough when I push your tumblers. Again.
I think it's safe to say you have a lot of locked up emotions.
How long have you had these feelings locked up inside?
Come now Mr. Anderson, we can't start on your trust issues if you won't give me the combination
Don't worry; a 20-20-40 combination is healthy for a safe your age.
High cholesterol is the least of your problems
Relax. I just need to hear whats wrong with your clicker.
You can open up here, it's a safe space.
You're in a safe space.
So, how are the vault and piggy banks?
No problem, Mrs.Leary. You can come in, after the election, for the rest of your physical.
I have bad news. You're full of arcade tokens.
Pulse elevated. Turn your head and cough up Donald Trump's tax returns and you will feel much better.
It's okay, this is a safe space
If you’d like a second opinion, I can refer you to a good second-story man.
I think you have taken the idea of "safe space" too far
I understand that safety is your main concern
We could try combination drug therapy.
Mr. Gore, are you still in there?
I'm a little worried. A normal heartbeat does not go ka-ching ka-ching.
After the exam, we need to discuss safe sex.
You were almost cracked. You need a stronger password.
No, your chest is all clear.
Your symptoms suggest you may be cracked.
It's tumbleritis!! You'll need one tablespoon of 3 in 1 oil, 4 times a day for 1 week.
Next, you'll need to open wide and say "ah."
I always wanted my office to be a safe-space.
Sir, you are safe with me and I do not speak in metaphors.
Tell it to me straight, Doc. Have they unlocked a cure?
It's alright, you're safe now.
I have just the right combination for you.
This is Mme. Schrodinger. Please Meow.
Yes I'd say you've taken more than adequate precautions to protect yourself from zika mosquitos.
I can't help you. Your heart just isn't in the right place.
You blood pressure's a little high: 55-23-47
I can hear your money talk but the problem is that it's not circulating.
Have you been tested for lead poisoning?
Your lab results were sub-prime
Get Schrodinger on the phone.
Well, maybe if you opened up to me I could tell you what's wrong
Fifth generation Episcopalian, eh? I might have guessed as much.
Why don't you just tell me the combination.
I think your blood pressure is a little on the high side: 135 left over 85 right.
Let's just try to think outside the box.
You clearly have a combination of symptoms.
You can't keep your feelings locked up like this.
When I touch the dial, I want you to turn your head and cough.
It's okay, you can be open with me.
You are right to get a second opinion. Having a false sense of security can be deadly.
As your psychiatrist, I am telling you that you need to open up and let me in.
I do detect an insecurity. Perhaps this is why you have trouble opening up."
Yes, you're still safe.
Yes Mr Houdini we can treat claustrophobia
Deep breath, Mr. Hoffa
It's hard to help when if you won't open up.
Now, a full deep turn to the right.
Don't worry, I'll have this open in a heartbeat.
PTSD is very common after trauma. How soon after the robbery did these feelings of emptiness and worthlessness begin?
If you want to be safe, you should get a second opinion.
I'd get a second opinion, just to be on the safe side.
The tick IS a bit faint but, in my professional opinion, you're safe.
You can come out now Mr. Jones. I am not the proctologist.
We can rule out anemia.
Cough louder.
I think you need to stop the "locker room" talk.
I'm afraid your number's up.
No, this is not how you practice safe sex!
You can feel safe with me.
If you feel safe, you can open up to me.
Spenser, you're going to have to come out and face the election with the rest of us.
Let it out. Keeping things inside isn't healthy.
Yes, this is a safe place...
How long have you been feeling all empty inside?
Welcome back. How's the claustrophobia treatment going for you?
Your right, you are very empty inside
If we go by the numbers you're a little on the heavy side.
I hear your pain . . . If only you would open up!
Come on. Just open up and let it all out.
Playing it safe has definitely paid off!
You feel like a million bucks? That's funny, so do I...
Yes, I told you your secrets are safe with me.
Sometimes a ball bearing is just a ball bearing.
Too many locks and not enough bagels.
Don't worry sir, you're totally safe.
This will go a lot easier for the both of us if you just tell me what's going on inside.
Do you feel safe?
I see what you mean about feeling empty inside.
Keyhole surgery is out. We're going to have to blast you open.
Listen, if there is anyone you can open up to, it's me.
I think you've got a heart of gold
It’s not healthy to keep your emotions locked up.
Click twice for me.
Rotate left and stop on 10, then turn to the right and stop on 3, then the left and stop on 30, then cough
I think it would be best treat this problem, with a safe, combination therapy.
It is not healthy to keep your feelings locked away!
You need to open up and show me the problem.
Your financial health is strong.
Calm down, you're safe now. Just give me three more clicks to the left.
Money talks--I can hear them!
Sounds like the money has stopped talking.
Stay calm, Mr. Feldman, we'll have you out of there in no time.
Yes, I'd say there's a low risk of you getting pregnant.
I wouldn't worry, a little dizziness is normal after two spins to the right and one spin to the left.
OK, I find you emotionally and physically ready for safe sex.
Let's see what's going on in there, shall we?
I know it's hard to trust me - but I'm nowhere near your prostate.
You're not opening up to me.
Don't bank on it but I think you're safe.
We don’t accept FDIC as insurance.
Just relax and tumble normally.
Your codicil needs to come out.
To be sure, we'll have to open you up.
You'll be safe for another year.
Seriously, it might feel weird at first but opening up is the best medicine for your condition.
Now, this maybe a little warm.
I really don't think you have enough air in there to last until after the election.
I think I know why you are feeling trapped.
I'm afraid your inorganic diet and sedentary lifestyle is a terrible combination.
I won't know how much I can help you, until I learn more about what's inside you.
It's not your vault.
So, how long have you been without food, Mr.Hoffa?
I've got plenty of time, if you ever want to open up.
You just can't keep things locked in.
It sounds like your insides are all locked up.
I'm going to need you to cough up a little more money.
You know the drill.
Hmm, have you traveled to Switzerland recently?
Yes, Mrs. Hawkins the election campaigning is over. Go ahead and tell me the combination.
Mr. Trump, I have good news and bad news. The bad news is no one can hear you. The good news is no can hear you.
Actually I have seen worse cases of agoraphobia.
Does it hurt when you do right three times to 43, the left once to 19?
"Open wide and say 'It's all yours, Doc'".
Open, and then say "ah".
If you were my patient all I would say is that you could lose 15 or 20 pounds.
Tell me more about your feeling suffocated. Quickly.
When I said it can be helpful to compartmentalize, Mrs. Weinstein, I didn't mean it literally.
In order to feel safe again, you need to unlock your inner self.
Any history of heart in your family?
The odd thing is people usually open up when they feel safe.
Louder, Mr. Carlson! I still can't hear your safe word!
Still... better safe than sorry!
Your chest seems a bit tight.
Heart rate is still too fast. You're keeping way too much locked up inside you.
Your pulse is a little high, are you hiding anything.
You're not twenty anymore. Perhaps you and your wife should change the combination.
My diagnosis is that you need to get out more, Mr. Houdini.
I think you're safe for now.
Trn your knob and cough
Yes, it's safe.
There's nothing wrong here that a new combination won't fix.
Your money or your life.
You're safe here.
I'm afraid we won't know if you've met your deductible until I complete the procedure.
How about next allergy season we just try an anti-histamine?
In my professional medical opinion, you've gotten yourself locked in a safe again Mr. Jones.
Open up, and say aaaaaaah!
Of course you can speak freely...this is a safe place.
You really need to open up about your medical history.
I'd love to help you, but I can't get to your co-pay.
You profess a steel exterior,but you're empty on the inside.
Your tumblers are a little sludgy. I'd double the broccoli and cut the cheese.
Sounds like you didn't practice safe sex.
Let's get the copay out of the way first.
And what is your mother's maiden name?
How often do you exercise?
I'm afraid I'll have to refer you to an internist
It's normal to feel unsafe from time to time.
Now please open and I'll say "Ah!!!"
If you want help, you need to be more open
I thought money was supposed to talk.
How's the old clicker?
Yes, I am a doctor of internal medicine.
Your numbers are far worse than last year's.
I appreciate your frustration, sir, but we have no access to your password as long as you are in safe mode.
When I turn your dial, please cough.
When did you start thinking there was more to life than money?
Since you don't have insurance, I'm going to have to open you up first.
I sense you are keeping something from me.
When was the last time you were cracked?
Now, lets see what makes you tick.
This isn't a compliment but you have a heart of gold.
Now take a deep seventeen right.
Over time, I am confident we will find a combination that will allow you to open up and be yourself again.
you're going to need to open up for me
Sorry if the stethoscope is too warm.
It's safe to come out now, Mr. Jenkins, Trump is way down in the polls.
There's a 95 percent chance we won't need dynamite.
It's safe to say your numbers don't add up.
I hear that you can't open up...
Sorry if it's a little warm.
I'm beginning to regret naming this clinic 'A Safe Space'.
This diagnosis would be a lot easier for both of us if you would just open up.
I'm detecting a combination of symptoms.
Say: "Open Sesame."
Sounds like a severe case of tumblelitis.
Your chest results came back with a number of combinations.
All square but you need to start practicing safe sex.
You've really got to open yourself up if you want the treatment to work.
Are we looking for a safecrack or a wisecrack?
Well, at least you're better than sorry.
You might have abs of steel, but you have no heart.
You need to cut back on the junk bonds and derivatives, and go on a strict cash diet.
Breathe in and out deeply, Mr. Houdini.
It's normal to feel a certain degree of isolation, Mr Houdini.
You do not need to whisper. You are in a safe place.
How long have you felt like your insides were all locked up?
I am going suggest a combination of therapies, and you tell me if your are open to it.
Your heart sounds wealthy.
It's a combination psychosis.
My professional opinion is that you need to be more open.
These symptoms can arise from any combination of conditions.
Sounds like newmoneya.
I'm hearing security is an issue.
I am a doctor dammit, not a safecracker!
Some health issues are not easy to crack and your symptoms might be the result of a combination of things.
Just whisper your safe word
If you would just open up, I'm sure I would feel much better.
You can open up to me, I'm a docotor.
Tap if you can hear me.
Well, your X-rays showed nothing. . .
You are safe to open up here!
Trust me, you can open up now. This is a safe space.
You're going to have to be more specific than to say you have an empty feeling.
Well yes, other people's opinions do determine your value.
I want you to feel safe opening up to me.
Pardon, did you say acne or Acme?
Your tumblers are fibrillating.
You took a tumble, but you'll be okay.
I follow your blogs on Tumblr.
Do you want your blood pressure in dollars or Euros?
Sounds empty....you Do have insurance, right?
The referring physician tells me you're feeling empty inside.
The bad news is, that was your third failed login attempt.
Your secrets are protected by doctor-patient confidentiality, so its perfectly safe to open up here.
Feel secure; your tumblers sound fine.
Of course you can open up, this is a safe environment.
Just a few more appointments and we should be able to crack this.
It's nothing to be alarmed about.
It's a combination of things, but I think you're safe.
The good news is you’re still breathing; the bad news: Your policy doesn’t cover safe cracking and there’s a $5,000 deductible.
And when did your breathing problems start, Mr. Blaine?
I hear the ticking and I believe you're about to take a turn for the worse.
You definitely show symptoms of being cracked.
Can I be hearing sounds of safe sex?
This is the easy part. We'll need a whole team to open you up for the colonoscopy.
your iron seems to be a bit high
How can I help your Mr. Houdini?
If you'd just open up, we could really get to the bottom of what's happenening to you.
Dr. Johnson are you asking me if I engage in something other than safe sex?
Just remember, it's what's on the inside that counts
Once you feel comfortable opening up, I think you'll make progress in therapy.
Your iron level is through the roof!
Sir, I know that you're shy ... but you have to come out of your safe space.
If I'm going to help you, you'll have to open yourself up to me.
Can you hear me now?
Try as she might, Anna began to realize that traditional psychoanalysis methods are probably not going to work with Mr Gittinger's severe agoraphobia.
A classic case of "Pneumoney"
I would like to run a few tests, just to be safe.
Turn your head and cough up the money.
You'll do best on a combination drug.
I'm sorry, but, you'll never be totally safe.
I may need to do a bypass and crack your chest!
Believe me, it's who you are on the inside that counts.
The Feds are gone, Mr Trump
When I said this is a safe place, I didn't mean that literally.
The cause is just stress from your job at the bank. Seeing it more and more these days.
Turn your dial and cough up $200.
We'll let you out on November 8th.
You're not alone.We all feel emptiness inside.
If you start feeling uncomfortable, use your safe word.
Do you feel safe at home?
We've talked about you locking away your emotions.
I'm afraid Mr. Trump won't let you out until after the election, Hillary
Not to worry...your secret will be safe with me.
Sounds like Geraldo Rivera
Actually, by law, I'm required to provide a safe space.
I think it's safe to say that I see no need to crack you open.
Under your plan, the patient is responsible for the copay when the doctor cracks the case.
I'd say you are safe.
For a safe your age you are pretty sound.
So you say it's a hollow feeling?
'I'm-Locked-In-A-Safe' Who?
I'm going to prescribe for you a combination of drugs.
I'm hesitant to order an x-ray.
Now turn around and bend over. Your health plan requires us to check your bottom line.
You can pay with cash or bearer bonds.
I'm afraid we'll have to open you up, but it will be a safe procedure.
Please turn your dial and click
The things I do for money!
No, 1000 lbs is not good, and yes, it is your vault.
I assure you, Mr. Carlson, a flu shot is just as effective, and far less confining.
I see you've decided on the non-invasive treatment approach.
