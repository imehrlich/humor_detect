It could work. We both like worms.
One of us should look more concerned.
Where are the statues? I can't hold it in anymore.
I identify as fish
Will we raise the kids as birds or fish?
Let's walk into a bar.
What am I doing here? I missed my flight.
What do you mean I'm adopted?
No, you don't look like your profile photo.
It's not you. I've just...evolved.
I had a little work done.
Disingenuous? ME ??? YOU described yourself as 'wingy ' !!!
Be VERY afraid – we have bigger fish to fly.
You and me birdbrain.
"I've had it with your Phishing scams"! "Well, I've had it with your Tweets"!
Fish gotta swim, birds gotta swim.
Well, one of us is right.
Let me guess...Pisces.
The inevitable face-off of Roe vs. Egg.
One bad tweet and they put you on the no-fly list.
Vito warned me if I sing like a bird I'm gonna swim with da fishes.
Either you're a flying fish or I'm a dead duck.
Believe me, worms don't come with hooks.
Your brother is alive, in an aquarium in Queens.
Sometimes it would be nice if we could stay at my place instead.
One of these things is not like the other...
Without climate change, we never would have become friends
I told the genie that my first wish was for a perfect perch . . .
Actually, I think it's, "Fish gotta swim, Birds gotta fly."
I don't see species.
Ten thousand eggs at once! Wow!
Let's call Escher - he'll know how to fix this.
The pig's right behind me.
I was a stool pigeon and now I sleep with the fishes.
You'll be a real catch for someone else.
I know Mom will love you. Dad may eat you.
After Trump was elected, I was SURE I'd see a pig flying up here
I believe you're out of water.
One of these things is not like the other, one of these things just doesn't belong...

I think we should go back to long distance. I can't breath in this relationship.
Seriously, ours come without hooks.
One of us is going to have to wake up.
Well we BOTH can't be right.
First time in the Cloud?
No way! I like worms too!
whatever you do, don't look down.
Mom, am I adopted?
...and then they said 'youlz be swimmin with da fishes'....
Our parents will never understand.
And our offspring will be neither fish nor fowl
Are you in my dream, or am I in yours?
Our parents are gonna freak out.
Dad, I've decided to come out as transspecies.
Tell me the truth, Mom. Was I adopted?
I'm a little out of my comfort zone.
Do you ever feel out of your element?
Is this where stool pigeons go to sleep with the fishes?
They kept saying the sea was rising, I just didn't believe them.
One of us is seriously screwed.
I hear you have a good school system.
Of course you know our parents will never approve.
You look nothing like your tinder profile.
Great costume.
Some weather we're having, eh?
"Do you ever feel like a fish out of water"?
You're late, I got the worm!

Well, you don't look much like your profile picture either.
Climate change, am I right?
It could work. We both like worms.
This Travel Ban is so confusing, isn't it!
Okay, my dating profile may not have been completely accurate.

I'm on the no fly list.
I see the cat ate you too
I've been looking for a perch!
Holy Mackerel!
If you're not a fish out of water I'm in deep trouble.
Guess who's coming to dinner.
One of us is out of our element.
Now why exactly were you kicked out of school?
No school today?
I told my parents!
Is it "fish gotta fly, birds gotta swim," or did I hear that wrong?
Fish gotta fly and birds gotta swim and that's not fake news either.
There's a catfish and a dogfish, so why not?
Birds gotta swim; fish gotta fly.
I need to see the loan shark. My nest is under water.
Tonight, you sleep with the pigeons.
One of us is outside our comfort zone.

You don't look like your profile picture either.
You don't look like your profile picture either.
I self-identify as a fish.
Well, I've always sung it, "Birds gotta swim and fish gotta fly".
Actually, I'm looking for a perch.
Sorry son, but I need to finally tell you - you were adopted.
No, I’m pretty sure it’s “Fish gotta swim, BIRDS gotta fly.”
That's not the picture you posted on match.com!
This proves it. GPSs are 100% wrong, 50% of the time.
Just keep flapping.
Actually, I can use whichever biosphere I identify with.
I’m a triathlete. I fly, swim and poop on as many car windshields as possible.
You can't get there from here.
Thanks for meeting me half-way.

Just give it a couple hundred million years, you'll get there.
I thought the F stood for female.
Screw the scientists, they told the bumblebees the same thing.

Be smart, stay in school.
Yeah, but it's just a theory.
You never reply to my tweets.
One of us is about to die.
Now try flapping them up and down.
One of us is having a really bad day.
Your profile said odd bird seeks companion.
I didn't think the oceans could rise any higher.
Perch?

Yes, I do have confidence in my GPS - Why do you ask?
It's not you, it's me.
You look nothing like your profile picture.
What time is your flight
This will not end well for one of us.
You're a strange bird.
Am I drowning, or are you flying?
I don't know either, global warming?
Ok, compromise: H2O2.
Tornadoes suck
I just don't understand you anymore. Its like we're not even of the same species.
It isn't you. It's me.
We'd never have met had it not been for climate change
This just isn't working anymore. You refuse to evolve.
You looked different in your profile picture.
You are clearly out of your depth
...and that's the story of global warming.
Sure this is impossible, but two years ago I would have said the same thing about Trump being president!
Out of school?
Aren't you supposed to be in school?
I hate this mirror.
But where would we raise the kids?
I just feel that I am out of my element.
We expect immigrants to assimilate.
Out for some air?
I don't really like labels, but I consider myself bi-evolutional.
Without science, anything is possible!
No shit? I love worms, too
If fish can fly, and birds can swim, anybody can be President.
My dream or yours?
But how will we raise the kids?

I love worms too!
Just practicing for climate change.
How do you know that I am the father?
But, where would we live?
Wow. You missed about 350 million years of evolution.
Can we just agree to disagree on everything but worms?
Did you just see a pig go by?
So, then...you're not my real father?
A fish out of water? Wow, you're a real idiom!
Skies are falling, sea levels are rising, Here I am, stuck in the middle with you.
I'm starting to regret voting for the cat, just to shake things up.

I'm not into labels.
It's a long story called evolution.
Nobody's gonna believe my next tweet.
Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly. Or is it the other way around?

Are you by any chance a perch?
Wow, I'm a Pisces too!
I just came out as a bird.
Schooling has really changed you.

Unusually wet fall, don't you think?
I'm late. Any worms left?
The costume is a little uncomfortable but the sharks leave me alone.
Really? Three quarters of the earth isn't enough?
I guess we are living in a post-'when pigs fly' world, aren't we?
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
I gotta stop drinking.
Flyfishing?
Well, ONE of if us is out of his element.
The worms come with a catch?
Everything you've heard is true.
No offence, but you look nothing like your picture.

But, if this were your dream, there'd be bubbles!
What do you mean, you don't tweet?
You don't look anything like your profile picture.
Where's a good oxygen bar around here?
I guess sea level is rising faster than expected
I love Gary's parties. You never know who you're gonna meet.
"We can't keep on meeting like this".

Don't play Koi with me.
You think this is unbelievable? Wait 'til you hear who's in the White House...
So, are you a legal or illegal immigrant?
You don't look anything like your match.com profile photo.
are you Cod?
Mother said you'd be a fine catch.
Don't look down, or you'll flounder.
It's easier than being a little bird in a big sky.
Birds gotta swim, fish gotta fly ... or something like that.
I did not expect the ocean levels to rise this fast.
My doctor said swimming is easier on the joints.

I'm afraid that my parents would object.

We're going to build a wall and you fish are going to pay for it!
I have no use for a bicycle, either.
Well we both go with a nice Chablis.
It gets easier after the first few million years.
Moving in together will definitely change this relationship.
It would never work betweeen us - you're a Pisces and I'm a pigeon.
Still doubt climate change?
I taught the pig last week.
One of us is going to be very disappointed when we wake up from this dream!
One of us is in trouble!
Didn't you get the memo?
Can you believe this weather?
Can you give me directions to the underwater statues?
The sky has fallen!
People kept telling me, 'There's plenty of fish in the sea,' so, I guess, hi. I'm Rickie.
I thought you should know, I'm a Carrier.
There seems to be a glitch in the Matrix.
It’s harder to breathe but there are fewer hawks.
Now do you believe climate change is real?
Remember the old song? "Fish gotta fly, birds gotta swim. . ."
Huh! I was expecting a pig.
My opinion is that you're a fish out of water.
I refuse to be pigeonholed.
You make a compelling argument that it is nurture, not nature.

But what do you think our parents will say?
Is this the Fish Fly?
I'll tell you what's different. worms don't taste the same.
Thank goodness Trumpcare didn't pass. It covered neither fish nor fowl.

Got any threes?
Those are the smallest wings I have ever seen !
I went to camp, of course I know how to swim.
Just stay away from the cats.
What's all this hoo ha about fish and chirps?
A friendship like this could land us internet stardom.
Isn't it fascinating that we both like to eat worms?
I don't like being arbitrarily assigned to an evolutionary niche either, but could you not use the term pigeon holed?
Okay, I see, you're an alternative fish.
But where can we build our nest?
I love you, but where will we live?

We probably should change dating sites.
I refuse to be pigeonholed.
I like to tweet to communicate, how about you?

Holy Mackerel!
I think we are attacking this worm issue from different angles.
I fear this has encounter 'mixed metaphor' written all over it.
My analyst tells me I should try new things.
You're not from around here, are you?
Unless one of us has evolved, this will be a very quick meeting!
Can't see them ever pigeonholing you.
You're in my lane

Get out -- I'm a Pisces too!
Even Al Gore didn't think things would get this weird.
The post-factual world is so liberating.
Your dream or mine?
So are you alt-swiming? Or am I alt-flying?
Either you're flying or I'm drowning.
But where would we build a home?
One of us is seriously lost.
How about that humidity!
Jeez, the sea level rose faster than anyone could have predicted
Your place next time?
Of course I'll marry you -- as long as you are committed to not having kids.
Maybe so, but I'd like to see you land on that telephone wire.
Honey, it won’t matter how we raise our children. I’m going to eat them.
Your going to love it here. All the worms you can eat with no strings attached.
I thought rising sea levels would be a bit slower.
And I'm telling you...climate change is a hoax.
Quid pro quo. Now teach me to swim.
How long have you been on the no-fly list?
Some birds gotta swim.
You must know that one of us is in real trouble.
Why am I here? Why are YOU here?

I suppose we have climate change to thank.

Where will we live?
This is why I question computer dating services.

It's not "birds gotta swim and ..." ?
We won't know which of us is in trouble til the background's drawn in
I enjoy fly fishing.
You look different than your profile photo.
Oh man. I thought it was "Birds gotta swim. Fish gotta fly"
Is this a 'Fish out of Water' tale?
...and his name is Nemo...
Wow a talking fish
Well, one of us is screwed.
I agree this is clearly an existential crisis. We will know soon for which one of us.
So this is where the worms go.
You look high to me.
You do realize, one of us is proving Darwin correct.
This must be Heaven. There are no cats anywhere, and I’m talking to a fish.

Are we in YOUR alt reality or MINE?
In a few billion years I'm outta here
Yeah, right! When pigs fly.
Don't be scared; immigrants are welcome here.
No, the saying is NOT "Birds gotta swim and fish gotta fly".
Actually, we have a lot in common. You're out of school, I've left the nest.

Fish and chirps. We belong together.
Did you see which way that pig went?
If I look like a duck and quack like a duck, I'm a fish - it's called Trumpism.

I'm pretty sure one of us is in big trouble!
I do a lot of cross-training.

I don't trust you. Your tweets seem fishy.
Sorry, but we've changed our immigration laws
I'm right, you're left, but we both love worms so maybe we can start our conversation there.
It's the soggy bread crumbs I can't get used to.
I feel like I'm out of my element.
Let's agree to disagree.

Either way, one of us is about to die.
My doctor said I needed to do low impact.
Bet you never took a dump on statue.
The EPA trashed the air, I wanted to see if the water is any better.
I admire your alternative facts.
When Trump eliminated the EPA Clean Air regulations, it is now healthier to breathe water than air.
I'm out of my element.
Are You My Mother?
Go, fish.
It's not an alternate fact. You don't have wings so you can't fly.
Let's just agree to disagree.
You flying fish think you're so smart because you've been in schools, but how capable are you at carrying messages?
I'm sorry, sweetheart; you're not evolved enough for me.
Just don't get my father started talking about charter schools, and you'll be fine…
If we do marry, I feel we need a new place to live.
Okay...yes, but where will we live?

Your online profile made you look more like a mallard.
First off, you're at 33rd and Sixth, second, climate change was not a hoax.
No worries-I've just gone vegan
I didn't realize the humidity was THAT high!
It won't be a mixed marriage. We're both Mormon.

No matter how you look at it... one of us in in trouble!
One of us is living in alternative reality.
So, you couldn't swipe left either...
I'm not the first flyer who overshot the runway and went for a swim.
It's not just a compatibility thing, Mark. It's an oxygen thing, too.
No, not touristy things. I'm here to immerse myself in the culture.
Whose alternative facts are these?
One of us is out of our element.
I've only got a minute.
It's not that I'm anti-water so much as I'm air-neutral.
Funny, in my dream I'm swimming.
It's when pigs fly, you moron.
Was it hard getting in your school?
I'm just checking to see if the water is cleaner than the air.
OK. Now you teach me swimming.
Well, one of us is going to be suffocating pretty soon.
Either I'm way out of my element, or you're in way over your head.
On a scale of one to ten how's your oxygen level?
Let's agree to disagree.
You're out of your element here.
Wow! I guess sea levels really are rising.
You're going the wrong way!
Don't look down.
Our parents will never agree to our marriage.
A pointless space station experiment is what I think.
Only one of us can be the Chicken of the Sea
We need to break up. You're suffocating me.
Okay, if you're really committed to this thing, you need to know the best statues to poop on.
So, who evolved from who?
Fantasy meeting you here!
A relationship with you could never work. You're all wet.
As Mr. Gershwin said, "Birds gotta swim...fish gotta fly."
How have you adapted to global warming?
I told you it's like swimming without the water!
Well one of us is a fish out of water.
Just leave the worms for me and we'll get along fine.
Excuse me, sir, but do you speak pidgin?
Can you hear me now?
All I'm saying is that our love for worms isn't enough to fuel the relationship.
I'm not about to make a big flap over it, but there's something fishy about you, my friend.
I thought I would try a different migration route.
You new here?
Ever wish you could just walk away from it all?
Weird; I like worms too!
Listen, it's not me, it's you.
I'm setting up an offshore company to buy underwater mortgages.
I probably need to stop using Waze.
What do you mean, what am I doing in your neck of the woods?
I'm changing my lifestyle!
And they voted me off the ark.
So you're the proverbial fish out of water
Are you or I in the wrong restroom?
I'm species neutral
No more computer dating for me.
Trust me, the worm is a tool of capitalist exploitation.
Flying lessons ? It will cost you a fin
I seem to be out of my element.

No! Fish gotta fly, bird's gotta swim
Learn to tweet.
I hear we both taste like chicken.
Habitat flexibility is essential in today's climate.
I was born a bird, but I identify as a fish......mind if I use the bathroom?
I know I was born a fish, but surely you can see why I should use the bird bathroom now
I like worms, you like worms, let's get together.
Only one of us can be right
I HAVE to know, did they find Dory or not??
Humid out.
I still think we should do a flyby.
It's not as easy as it looks.
School or flock? At this point, what difference does it make?
Unfortunately, I don't think one can escape the effects of global warming by re-locating.
There are worms falling out of the sky. What's the hook?
I don't eat red meat either.
Hi, I'm Luca Brasi.
Nothing surprises me anymore.
Have you never heard of Fly Fishing?
I have heard some say it's due to global warming.
I brought a message from the future. Swim, crawl, walk THEN fly.
Just breathe through your nose.
But sweetheart, our children would be mythical.
HI! SPRING BREAK?
I didn't get the bill.
It finally happened. They moved my job off shore.
I was going to be a fish too, but they were out of costumes.
Actually, a lot of us have moved here recently. Who can afford Manhattan or Brooklyn anymore?
This school needed more diversity.
We should probably figure out which one of us can't breath.
You're really sweet, but you're so invasive.
You're new around here, aren't you?
How to raise the kids is the least of our problems.
No. I get the worm.
Keep flappin, and they'll grow for ya, mine did!
Are you "free range"?
You must be a fish out of water.
Slow down! You're supposed to spend a few million years trying to crawl onto land first.
We must be tripping!
"Now do you believe global warming is real"?
We're either all wet or high as a kite.
Knee replacement – I'm in re-hab.
Excuse me, I'm new around here. Could you point me to the nearest statue?
Okay then, one of us must be dreaming.
I'm an exchange student.
One of us needs to wake up.
We are going to build a wall to keep fish in the water.
We have to work together now that the EPA is "non-essential."
No, seriously, Donald Trump is president!
Why do we always have to meet at your place?
No school today?
You keep coming up with objections. We'll adopt.
All I know is that it's breathtaking for one of us.
No, silly, it's "fish gotta SWIM, BIRDS gotta fly."
This can't be good.
But where would we build our home together?
Remember: Mother will be fine; it's Father we have to convince.
You don't have to tell me, you're a fish out of water.
Are you too high or am I?
What part of "the birds and the bees" don't you get?
Sea World's in a pinch. You should apply.
All I know is one of us took a wrong turn somewhere.
That worm you just ate was for the birds.
One of us is in deep trouble.
Congratulations! You've mastered the flying course! Now I'll teach you how to leave droppings on a windshield.
You know according to science, we could be related!
Boy, your arms must be tired.
Flying has become such a hassle.
We've run out of space up there.
I live an alternative lifestyle.
This guy named Escher said, 'Wait here, I'll be right back.'
Alternative Fact: Fish Can Fly.
So, a duck and a fish walk into a bar...
Well, at least we see eye to eye.
I'm here to be schooled.
Psst... I think we have different daddies.
I gotta swim too.
I need to get some air.
That may be, but I gotta love one man 'til I die.
I have to stop eating that cheap birdseed!!
I think you'll find it's not any easier to breathe up here.
So what do you think a penguin is, a fish or a bird?
Here for the Galapagos reunion?
Have you run into Escher anywhere around here?
How interesting that our alternate realities are each other's realities!
I don't care what your mother says, We can make it work!
You looked different in your Tinder profile.
Looks like you're out of your element.
Hey honey, I think I found Nemo!
All differences aside, we share the same background.
Gosh, you make me feel so ... so metaphoric.
"Can a relationship be sustained on love of worms alone"?
Remember when we had to use our gender specific bathrooms?
I'm a real fish out of water.
For you, "I believe I can fly." is a euphemism.
Just getting a jump on global warming.
New to the neighborhood?
So Escher picked you for a model too?
There's a really good reason you feel a draft.
So I said to him, 'Just how do we go forth and multiply?'
I have to tell you--this really changes my mind on the whole climate change thing.
One of us is holding our breath!
Flyfishing?
Fly fishing helps me unwind.
Are you dreaming of flying or am I dreaming of swimming?
It's not just fluid dynamics; you made a wrong turn at Niagara.
I was home flocked but am now looking for a good school
Never trust a homing pigeon for directions.
I can tolerate your odd views on reproduction, but you kiss like a fish.
I was looking for fish in all the wrong places.
Have you evolved to fly, or am I swimming?
Sorry, Dad! The cloning lab screwed up!
One of us should not be here. I hope it's not me.
How's your school?
I was in the running but Escher found me too pedestrian.
You know what...we'll just have to agree to disagree.
Well, I'll ask around, but I'm pretty sure it's "fish gotta swim."
If you see a worm, it's mine.
My personal trainer suggested some cross-training.
I'm sorry, it's not you, it's me.
Are you high, or am I?
Not quite. First it's the chicken, THEN me, then the turkey.
Joe and Bob share their common fear of cats.
This may be a new high for an invasive species.
You must be a fish out of water.
I rarely date outside my genus.
Your place or mine?
And let me guess. Pisces rising?
"So, you're that fish out of water"!
No, the early fish is still screwed.
You're screwing with evolution!
Wow! You must be a genius!
Are you sure your parents are okay with us?
Lost in migration.
Dori? No. Why?
I'm a homing pigeon, but I think I'm really lost!
Only in the New Yorker would the two of us ever meet.
I know, you're a Pisces & like to take long swims at the beach.
If you fall there's Obamacare.
Yes. It's called fly fishing.
Oops. Wrong perch.
One of us must be an alternative fact
I understand that we may be related?
Birds gotta swim; fish gotta fly.
You look nothing like your Tinder photo.
It depends on what 'perch' mean to you.
Sometimes the medium really is the message.
Either you're one of those flying fish, or I'm in big trouble!
If the medium is the message, what medium is this?
Ive heard "when pigs fly!" but this is a new one.
I don't know if I'm figuratively high, or you're actually high.
Morning, how's the water?
I can teach you how to tweet.
I knew something was fishy when my homing device told me to continue straight at the edge of the pier.
Why are we always meeting at your place?
We're also the rats of the sea.
We both like worms so we have that much in common.
Let's face it, you're a fish out of water.
Species are fluid!
When do you think we should tell our parents?
Damm Google maps!
One of us is in big trouble.
Let me guess, Google Maps?
Where are we? We're neither here nor there.
One of us is wrong.
I follow you on Fishbook
Escher couldn’t make it. There’s a travel ban on Dutch Tessellaters.
I'm looking for a good perch.
Terrific! I was looking for a good perch.
When you go high, I go low.
One of us is about to have a very bad day.
"Freddie the Flounder sends his regards".
Birds of a feather don't always flock together.
Well this should put that whole "neither fish nor fowl" argument to rest.
We left the ocean, became reptiles, than dinosaurs, than birds. What have you been doing?
Actually, I'm fly fishing.
This is precisely why people should never drink and draw.
This is the heaviest fog I've ever seen.
But, where would we live?
So you're a flying fish. I'm still waiting to see pigs fly!
'What will the parents say?'
Darling, if you can fly, I can swim.
I feel a magnetic attraction to you, maybe it's the lead?
I just saw a pig.,
Stop playing, koi!
This is my first migration.
Good, now turn into a horse.
It's easy--just put your lips together and blow.
The owl goddess told us this day would come: 100% humidity.
wait...wait....we met in Bombay, right?
We both got it wrong. "Birds gotta fly, fish gotta swim."
Silly goose! You aren't supposed to be here!
Sorry, I don't do beak-to-gill.
No,it's Iowa.
I don't like to be pigeonholed.
One of us has a problem....
They throw bread at me too.
I have a message for you.
One of us has a big decision to make.
I'm from the government, and I'm here to help.
We're between Cartoon Editors.
One of us is in for a huge disappointment.
One way or another, my folks are gonna love you.
Doesn't look good. He said"A bird may love a fish-but where will they build a home together?"
Oxygen is so overrated.
The drones were the last straw for me.
Remember when they thought global warming was a hoax?
It's time for real change. No more Donkeys & Elephants.
You've heard of Chicken o' the Sea, right?.
Okay, no sushi for dinner.
You ask where we'll live? No problem! I've got a condo in Boca!
You do realize that we're wallpaper?
Aren't you a bit out of your element?
You should really have a parachute.
Word we're getting now is climate change was a hoax.
No, you get the legs first, THEN the wings.
I was in your place once.
Well I be damn, fish can fly
According to Darwin, we shouldn't be seen together
The rents in my neighborhood were just sky high.
Now do you believe in global warming?
Man, one of us is really high...
I'm just a bird, standing in front of a fish, asking it to love me.
I was just wondering the same thing.
I don't know quite how to say this, but you're out of your element.
Water that bad, eh?
Fake Science
Anyway, we both look at the same moon.
You can't get there from here.
One of us is having a really bad day.
The doctor will see you now.
After this can you teach me how to swim?
I come in peace.
You'll be fine. Just don't look down.
Give yourself a couple million years.
Is this the new normal?
We'll prbobably be on a sampler plate somewhere.
... first you'll need to walk on land; flying comes later.
You plan to hang out up here for the entire fishing season?
Don't worry, Honey--I know a fabulous plastic ornithologist.
Worms do taste better without hooks.
Talk about rising sea levels!
I feel the same way but this is wrong.
You're what we call a bird of a different feather.
Fancy running into you here...
I'm a bird out of air.
Come meet my friend, Mr. Escher.
They ran out of trees,so I live here now.
I'm going to lay off those poppy seeds.
I couldn't believe my Ancestry DNA results either!
Flying fish, you say?
Are you my diversity partner ?
You're supposed to walk on land first!
Your mom says we're neither fish nor fowl, so does that mean we're good red herring?
I'm going to tell Noah it's too soon.
Really, it's not your medium.
I needed to get away from that incessant tweeting.
We gotta get outta here. This is no cartoon. It's a menu!!
I don't mind the not flying, it's the not breathing I have a tough time with.
It's a gray area, okay?
I just wanted to see how the other half lives.
Meet me at the bird bath.
What's so wrong with just being you?
I was expecting a pig.
So you really can fly Carp Kent!
On election night, I saw a pig up here.
I'm pleased to say that you've been exceeding our expectations.
They tried to pigeonhole me, too. Then again, I am a pigeon.
Great to meet a fellow foodie. Let's Netflix and chill some time.
I'm fighting segregation.
I AM with the current.
Great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great Grandpa?
Either you're a flying fish or I'm in deep trouble.
Are you flying on fake wings?
You know, one of us is defying physics.
Never trust GPS again!
I didn't know a Blowfish was lighter than air.
It's not you. I'm just saying the circumstances are unfortunate.
Care to split a worm?
I heard there's better schools down here.
Swimmingly! How about you?
So, you're what I evolved from?
I'm sorry but I'm not ready to introduce you to my family just yet.
I'm swimin'. Are you flyin'?
do you tweet
Okay, explain this climate change concept one more time...
One of us is quite extraordinary.
"I'm sure the lyric is fish gotta swim birds gotta fly".
Okay, I'm de-evolving, but it's getting hot up there.
My uncle still thinks climate change is just a hoax.
Climate Change deniers still refuse to believe that sea levels are rising.
From my view of things, a fish won't get caught if he simply keeps his mouth shut.
You new here?
Okay, it's your call. "Heads," it's air. "Tails," it's water.
Wawa
You look just like your profile photo.
Yeah, I'll split a worm with you.
Oh, I thought it was, "Birds gotta swim, fish gotta fly..."
Not all mixed marriages work
One of us is wrong.
One of us is in a lot of trouble....
Who taught you how to fly?
Either I'm having a bad dream or you are.
Honest grandpa, that evolution story is really true.
One of us is seriously misinformed.
So, if the medium is the message, what are you saying?
I'm stepping out for some fresh air, if you'd care to join me.
We've got to stop meeting like this.
I wanted my poop to float up instead of down for a change.
Yes, I've heard of Mr. Escher.
I haven't seen a single windshield down here. Where do you guys go to the bathroom?
On break from school?
You take my breath away!
I don't date outside of my phylum.
No, I don't have to worry about the wall either.
I don't believe in Cod. We will raise our babies neither fish nor fowl.
We can't go on meeting like this.
What are you in for?
You really don't look like your profile shot.
I’m sorry, I haven’t seen Nemo.
I knew privatization of the FAA was a bad idea.
Yada, yada, yada...now we have penguins.
We literally can't keep meeting like this
Global warming prepping.
My parents are going to be a real problem.
You never know what you will find on ancestry .com.
You're a fish. This isn't water.
Yeah well get me in the water and I'm like a bird on land
my great grandma was a carp, maybe you know her?
I call this "alternative flying".
We really can't go on meeting like this.
I'm an odd duck.
Let's try the veal.
One of us is in deep doo-doo.
One of us chose the wrong milieu.
Climate change?
For you are the fin beneath my wings.
A fish out of water? Wow, you're a real idiom!
This is the last time I try to pick a roommate online.
It's not you, it's me.
Do you ever feel out of your depth?
My drake is beginning to suspect.
You'll be able to do this in about 200,000 years.
So, how have you been since Hurricane Sandy?
Not everything is a metaphor, man.
Don't I know you from when we posed for M. C. Escher?
But where would we build a home?
No, my ears don't pop.
Yes, I AM like a fish out of water
Just flap your fins.
I don't get it.
I don't know, sometimes I just feel like a bird out of water.
I love you too, but where can we make our home together?
"My daddy was a rogue whale".
You skipped an epoch.
And then my mom said, 'you can be anything you want.'
Escher wants us to model for him.
We just have to get through the next four years.
I think you're out of your element.
Can I borrow a fin?
Now that we're engaged, how do we break it to our folks?
You? Again?
I'm afraid of heights.
Wow! You look just like grandma looked when she got out of the ocean and flew away a few million years ago!
Make evolution great again!
I think one of us is definitely lost.
I'm working on my global warming strategy.
You called for Twitter tech support?
I can't be lost! I'm a Homing Pigeon!
This would blow Darwin's mind.
Did Escher put you up to this?
With alternative facts, fish can fly.
Carpe diem!
''I appreciate the effort you've made for us to see eye to eye on this''
I posed for MC Escher, too!
would you like to comment on my tweet?
Are you a flying fish or am I all wet?
First time in a tornado?
I'm sorry, I meant the other kind of perch.
Fish or Fowl
Did you see where the rest of the penguins went?
TSA was on my ass.
One of us is in serious trouble.
For my gap year, I decided to travel abroad.
It really is the humidity.
This is one of those fish-out-of-water stories, isn't it?
I'm an exchange student.
Seriously, though, where are we going to build the house?
No, YOU sing bass.
I know this is a historically aquatic neighborhood, but my wife and I found a lovely fixer-upper for a quarter of the price we would have paid 'up there'
His tweets are unbelievable.
Either you're a flying fish or I'm a dead duck.
Looks like evolution took a left turn somewhere!
You're in my lane
Do you want to find Nemo or not?
Did you ever really NEED a bicycle?
I love your accent! Say something else.
My flock flew off north without me. Is it okay if I hang out here through the summer?
It's all fun now but wait "till you spend a night sitting on a branch.
How long can you hold your breath? About as long as you can fly.
Am I dreaming, or are you dreaming?
Where do you keep the oil remover?
Let me float something by you...
All I can say is further study is needed regarding the halucinogenic effects of climate change.
So, I see that you got out of that bad mortgage.
So then I asked myself in 140 characters or less, is this really what you want to be doing with your life?
Great, now I have to ponder the meaning of life.
Pardon me but would you have any Grey Poupon?
Hmm. Fancy meeting you here.
You're like a bird out of air.
Have you considered a different news source?
Thanks for meeting me at the horizon.
So where do you stand on this Darwinism fad?
He gutted the Clean Air Act, if he gets to the Clean Water Act, we're hosed.
Well aren't you a breath of fresh air!
Are you here for the diversity training?
I’ve always believed in global warming, but I had no idea it would advance so quickly!
Wait -- am I diving bird, or are you a flying fish?
Wanna go fly fishing?
The humidity here is beastly.
And of all the gin joints in the world, she swam into mine.
Ever heard of Charles Darwin?
If they find out we're talking it'll be all over CNN.
So did you see the pigs fly past just now?
But this IS water!
I'm a fiscal bird, but a social fish.
One of us is profoundly exceptional. The other, not so much.
The character is the thing...it doesn't matter what medium you're in.
Wow, you don't look anything like your profile.
One of us needs to go to rehab.
Please don't try that "fish outta water" line here.
I'll just tell my parents you're an alternative bird.
Did you get my tweet?
I'm a little out of my element.
Well I'll be a monkey's uncle!
Your flying is impressive, but where's your landing gear?
No, I haven't read Infinite Jest... But I love his Kenyon commencement speech!
So, what time do you get out of school?
Want to sign up for Twitter? We're now expanding underwater!
I’m not flighty, I’m just not sure our species can survive a long-distance relationship.
Wow! I guess sea level rise is not a hoax!
It won't work. Birds gotta fly; fish gotta swim.
A little fresh air, you'll be right as rain.
One of us has made a terrible mistake.
One of us is out of their element.
Didn't expect to run into you here.
As a matter of fact I love worms!
Our children will be flying fish.
I thought you were a metaphor.
I was tired of being pigeonholed.
This whole long-distance thing just isn't working for me.
You know, birds started out as fish, so be patient.
Holly moly! One of us must be very high!
um excuse me, I identify as a fish.
Well, we can agree it's not a solid.
Any place around here where you can get a decent plate of worms?
Your leap first struck me as quantum.
When they go low, you go high.
No, I use lungs.
You could have knocked me over with a feather.
We can't both be right.
Hi! AncestryDNA says we're related.
Are you sure you are not a catfish?
I'm visiting distant cousins.
Why don't you grow a pair!
There is no underlying reality.
If one of us was wearing a hat this would be a really weird dream.
All my friends told me I was getting catfished.
Well, one of us is wrong, and it ain't me.
Jesus?
You're not out of the woods yet.
Maybe it's YOU who's being unconventional.
Evolution has given me so much more freedom
Let's just agree to disagree.
I'll be the wind beneath your scales.
You've evolved!
Did you see a pink pig fly by recently?
I am hoping to get into your school
Am I dead, or am I tripping?
I'm out of my element.
You've got it wrong! It's BIRDS gotta fly.
I won't let you down.
Yes I'm a carrier pigeon, but no I can't carry you.
I identify as fish
My wife drinks to much.
Sorry, but it's bird gotta fly, fish gotta fry.
One of us is in for a rude awakening
Wow, climate change really is moving faster than expected!
I guess this is what you call a happy medium.
I thought there were other fish in the sea.
We need a little context here. Are you flying or am I swimming?
You made a HUGE mistake-you are a fish out of water!
You need to upgrade those wings.
No, I haven't seen plenty more up here either.
My great, great grandfather didn't have gills!
Consider me an alternative fish.
Well I will be damn, fish do fly
We have to start over. They still believe in gravity, but not in climate change.
Now all we need is something catchy like "surf 'n turf".
A full time job is out of the question. You'd be like a fish out of water.
Fire and earth texted, they'll be late,
How did you know I was new around here?
Can I have your bicycle now?
It's not much cleaner up here, mate.
One of us is terribly misplaced.
Go back to school.
So, how long you up for?
What, you've never been catfished before?
I am not a fly by night, but you are sure a fish out of water.
I'd say you're a fish out of water.
You look nothing like your profile picture.
Remember, we are flying the friendly skies!
You need to get out more.
Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly. Maybe it's birds gotta swim, fish gotta fly.
Is there a third option?
You're doing fine. Just don't look down.
I agree. The Earthworm is an acquired taste.
Which came first, the chicken or the egg?
Let's get a bunch of our friends and do an M.C. Escher!
Aren't we related on the maternal side?
We've just got to stop meeting like this.
A bit flighty, are we?
Hi, my name is Romeo.
You're new around here, aren't you?
The good thing is that we are in a watercolor.
So, we're in agreement. Fish got to swim and birds got to fly.
Sorry. My mistake.
Ever feel like you're out of your 20,000 leagues?
I was always a bird trapped in a fish body.
Wait here, I'll be right back; I just need to get some air.
No it's true, I found you through ancestry.com!
Wow! It's worse than I thought. I was expecting a pig.
My place or yours?
I'm trying to stay one step ahead of climate change.
Ever heard the expression 'like a fish out of water'?
No offense, but you're not really in your element here.
It appears one of us is out of their element...
Oscar Hammerstein would never believe this!
Where's the pig?
It seems that we are drawn together
We'll just have to agree to disagree.
Well, one of us is dying for sure..."
It goes back some time, but we're related on your mother's side.
I THOUGHT IT WAS "WHEN PIGS FLY."
Why would they take gullible out of the dictionary?
I love you too, but where will we live?
Skipping school again?
Well! Aren't you a fish out of water!
Context is everything.
To Hell with Darwin, let's go out and have dinner!
Good thing cats hate water
I'm sorry, it's not you, it's me.
Because I refuse to be pigeonholed!
You're not breaking the laws of nature if you don't get caught.
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
Well the law says I have to come back here to use the bathroom.
So, what do you call a fish out of water?
Without the EPA, it's easier to breathe water than air.
I see no reason we should be handicapped by evolution.
Swimming out of your lane, aren't you?
That was an alternative fact
Our kids might not be fish or fowl, but something much better!
One of us is a whacked-out freak of nature...
This is going to end badly for one of us.
Well, aren't you just a fish out of water!
One of us is in a lot of trouble....
It all makes sense now. You gotta swim, and I gotta fly.
...but since I was a chick, I have felt like I was a fish
It’s the fourth day, so God will be assigning us habitats.
You just can't handle the truth!
I'm lost. Can you point me towards the nearest statue
Let me guess...Pisces.
When did they change the saying to "When fish fly.."?
I didn't expect to see you again until our next lifetime.
I'm game.
Thinking I took a wrong turn in Albuquerque...
One of us is in the wrong cartoon.
I'm adopting a new lifestyle so I can no longer be blamed for those awful tweets.
I'm fairly confident that the traditional "birds and the bees" lecture isn't applicable to you.
I've always had a fear of flying.
Funny meeting you here.
Talk about a "bad air" day!
Either bathroom is fine.
Just believe you're underwater and you'll be fine.
This is the future that liberals want.
One of us is living alternative facts.
One of us is dreaming.
Long time no see.
One of us is mixed up
Don't you feel like a fish out of water?
One of us is in big trouble.
My ex-girlfriend told me 'there's a lot of fish in the sea,' but you're the only one I see.
So everything is gonna turn out swell when you hook up.
To be perfectly honest, I was expecting more parrot and less fish...
This is not going to end well for one of us.
The most unlikely pairing of two things since "President" and "Trump."
It's not quite 'Hamilton,' but there's something artisanal about it.
You've never been comfortable inside your own skin, have you?
One of us is off course
Well, for starters, we both like worms.
You must be new here.
You had me before hello.
I hate to tell you this, but I self-identify as a pelican.
Working on the diversity section of the application for Noah's Ark. Want to hook up?
Is it me or you?
My people thought this might happen when the EPA got dismantled
Thanks for taking time out of the water to be here today.
One of us is in deep trouble.
I thought the saying was when pigs fly...
What do you mean, "What the hell is water"?
Your turn to fly.
Tweet?
I got punked, I thought they said, see a fish fry.
Yeah, after having to breathe in that smog all the time I decided to learn how to breathe underwater.
Quick, while the taxidermist isn't looking!
Turns out it wasn't a Chinese hoax.
