Don't you think it is a bit stupid to watch a contest between an elephant and a donkey?
It's turned off. That's your reflection.
Wide-screen... I just don't see the appeal.
Aren't these reality shows on Wild Kingdom great!
There's nothing good on TV--wanna' neck?
Keep in mind that the camera automatically adds ten inches of neck.
"For the last time Frank, America's Got Talent is not going to show you strip a wild apricot tree bare in 10 seconds flat."
"Relax, they said they would leave if he won."
"Alexa, tell my TV to change the channel to Animal Planet."
Really? Zootopia??
who'd even want a dick that big?
How about a little necking on the couch?
Who'd ever guess that you're really a couch potato?
"Animal rights . . . this is all very nice, but it's still a cage. And where is our tall tree?"
Would changing the aspect ratio help - it'd be nice to see their heads.
"Suddenly, being an African American seems less sexy somehow."
Have I ever told you how elegant you look sitting down?
"""Real Housewives of the Savannah"" again?"
I've seen this episode of Animal Planet. Spoiler alert. It doesn't end well for us.
See. I knew you weren't above TV.
"THIS TIME OF YEAR, IT'S ALL ELEPHANTS AND JACK ASSES!"
Lion King again?
"""Animal Planet"" always adds 10 pounds."
We should have splurged on the wall mount

Netflix and neck?

"Why is the elephant wearing an ""I LOVE PUTIN"" T-shirt?"
"Get up Henry"" ""The zookeepers wife is back from vacation."
Wild Kingdom again?
There are just no decent parts for giraffes anymore.
You'd think the 'top-rated zoo in America' would feature cathedral ceilings.
"I prefer academy ratio to cinemascope, it allows for more headspace."
"Just a reminder, hon. Sitting like that is easy on your knees but strains your neck."
"Are you watching ""America's Necks Top Model?"""
"Something's wrong with the color. Humans don't come in orange, do they?"

Read my lips. No elephants!
It just looks wrong to me.
I know you think I'm sticking my neck out......

We need to raise the tv. Hang it on the wall. Something!

I think we would make an excellent 3rd party symbol.
Neck-flix and chill again?
Don't watch that show with the lions. It doesn't end well.
Anything good on the 'People Planet' Channel?
Don't tell me you swallowed the remote again.

I'm ordering food from 'Outback.' Want anything?
I prefer the TV shots from the blimp.
Where am I supposed to Sit to See the TV?

I know it's a jungle out there but you have to start getting out of the house.
Told you we should have went with the wall mount.
Did you see where the lions attacked those zebras?

The picture is spotty.

"...and then he had the nerve to say, ""TV is likely the cause of my neck problems."""
Let's stay in tonight. It's a zoo out there.

Living here is so much better than our African Savannah!

"Well, I don't want to watch it if you've already seen it."
"The only other Republican I felt this way about was Teddy Roosevelt, and that was because he shot my grandma."
I’ve requested an ergonomic review.
Comfortable silence it is!
"I keep telling you, there is no remote. Just lean over and change channels with your nose."
It's Animal Planet. They want to renegotiate your contract.
You would rather watch TV than neck?
"First the gorilla, then those alligators... it's a shame that it's 2016 and we still haven't found a way to all peacefully coexist."
"I'm sick and tired of the establishment ripping us off and making us graze on lower trees, backing down to the zebra's and refusing to address the threat that humans pose abroad."
Let's not stretch our viewing time!
You still watching the debates? Neither of them is addressing our issues.
I miss Marlin Perkins too dear but we really have to move on.
It's official - I'm the tallest thing on the block without TRUMP on me.

I'm sure glad we're not elephants or donkeys
"When I watch the National Geographic Channel, I just get reminiscent."
"I think mom hid the remote on purpose, again."
"You're addicted to those nature reality shows, aren't you?"
"Only just necking through the highlights tonight, dear."
The ceiling's too low
So glad we found this place with high ceilings.
Try flipping the screen to portrait.
If you scoot over we could neck.
The politicians are acting like they've bumped their heads daily since birth.
Something ruminative?
"Don't worry. I set the parental controls to ""herbivore."""
Why are you watching The Real Giraffes of New York City? They're just camels trying to marry up.
You're losing touch with reality; it's all just CGI.
"Oh, THAT kind of necking."
I'll never understand your fascination with Mr. Ed.
That was Noah on the 'phone again.
"What is more compatible with 'Game of Thrones' than a juicy, natural acacia branch?"
"""Ok, I can't reach it. Satisfied?"
I'm leaving you for a symbiotic relationship with a tickbird
"Last week it was the Elephants, this week it's the Donkeys. Where's our candidate?"
Maybe we should get out more.
Are you sure we haven't forgotten our roots?
That was elephant calling on his way back from Cleveland. He wanted to know if there were any openings at Barnum's.
"It's a mirror, but you have to get really low."
You don't need the remote control.
I think that show's a bit of a stretch.
"I checked, Dear. Room service has Acacia leaves."
"I've told you before, there's only one thing I hate as much as ceiling fans and that's small TV's."
I am tired of the media saying that the candidates are neck and neck.
Watching Giraffic Park again?
I don't get it. Why did the Elephants nominate an orangutan?
Quit watching those animal kingdom reruns and pay some attention to me for a change.
Is that a rerun of People Kingdom?

Those gutters aren't going to clean themselves!
You're sitting on the remote.
"Let's eat out tonight. I hear there is a good, new acacia tree in Central Park."
They totally don't get the ratio.
It subtracts ten inches.
Somehow everyone knows you're a girl giraffe.
Can we get a wall mount?
1. do you thing the ceiling is high enough 2. our designer thought we would compliment the decor nicely
Our neighbor complains we have a tendency to look down on him.
Must we have this conversation every time you watch QVC? Turtle necks do you no favors.
Everyone’s head is cut off because you installed the screen on its side.

I have to chose between seeing the feet or seeing the head.
This Black Tongues Matter movement has really taken off.
I don't care if it's 4K! It cuts everyone's heads off!

"Crick in the neck, sounds serious, how long will you be off your feet?"
It's may appeal to you but becoming domesticated appals me.
Work was a zoo today!

"Let me get this straight. Every game all day Sunday, a Sunday night game, Monday night, and most Thursday nights until your little fantasy league is finished? I'll be at my parent's house!"

CSI: Savannah is my favorite too.
"Honey, will you please come home. I'm sorry I called you a cow."
"Well, son, modern technology has made us obsolete. We've been replaced by the rear-view camera."
Real Housewives of the Serengeti?
Anything new on TV about same-sex couples?
Maybe it's stiff because you slept wrong!
Did you hear that? Trump is going to put us all in a Zoo!
Didn't I ask you to get a portrait template not a landscape!

What's streaming?
I thought that 60” was the vertical measurement.
I don't think we were even in the running when the democrats selected a mascot .
"""We could go shopping the lions are away for the weekend.'"
I really do prefer NEKFLIX to HBO.
Stop watching that damn t.v. and lets neck!
I agree. There is nothing as relaxing as an evening of TV after a hot day on the Serengeti.
"That's the trouble with politics today, not many remember how to rise to the occasion."
I see you paired the fainting couch with the Republican National Convention. Nice choice.

I'd like to redo the sofa in zebra.

How about something romantic and a whole lot of necking on the couch?

Let's upgrade to tall screen.
"Move your neck a little more to the left, and hold still. Perfect."
I know I'm old-fashioned but I'd rather listen to Saturdays in the Serengeti than watch Wild Kingdom reruns.
But are we really happier?
Your not a donkey or elephant so what are you going to do?
You're a real couch zucchini
It's a come-on. I wouldn't stick my neck out if I were you.

It's funny. These political pundits think they are sticking their necks out.
Basketball?

Woah. Lions are a lot less scary on TV...
It's the latest thing; a wide screen TV.
You do know it's not really about an elephant and a donkey.

We should have gone for the tall screen instead...

Sorry I'm late - today's photo shoot required extra footage.

What's on the Giraffe Channel tonight?
Watching the Nature Channel sideways doesn't make the violence and sexual content appropriate.
Discovery marathon?

This ain't to hard to swallow !
Your agent called. They're going a different way.
Could I interest you in MY forty-eight-inch display?
It's the suburbs out there!

You need to quit watching that Animal Kingdom show!
Perhaps if we turned it the other way...
The boss said I shouldn't stick my neck out.
I'm going to go out and stretch my neck.

We should have gotten the plasma set.
"Yep, you're dying."
Have you not noticed I removed all the ceilings
Lets turn off the tv and get neck-ed!
You can vote Libertarian....
I'm so glad we splurged on a place with high ceilings.
"Son, do something with your life. You can reach higher than this."
"I can deal with the lower ceiling, but it's the single 6 ft. bed that's a game changer."
"Yeah, but we don't complain when they invade our habitat !!"
Stop watching Animal Planet and go outside and look for Pokémon like all the other kids.
The best leaves on not on the Herbivore Channel! You gotta get out there Garry!

Are we being levelled with...?
"I think it is in the spot, bur don't you think a higher?"

What did I say about no hooves on the couch?
"I think it's about time for them to come up with ""Tall Screen"" television."

Sorry if you lost the signal. I hit my head on the dish again.
Watching the chiropractor network?
I specifically told you Hi Def

I got a crook in my neck yesterday from sitting that way and watching TV.
Would you like a drink?
I can't believe Junior made it to Animal Planet!
Again with 'The Lion King'?
"Babe, this is not why we moved to Brooklyn."
I can't get enough of these Toys R Us commercials.
"Gary, your giraffing me crazy!"
"Dear, Bror cheats on Karen who falls in love with Denys. It's just another predictable Streep film!"
"That does it. Next TV is portrait, not landscape."
Are you watching animal planet again?
Really Shelia?? Why would I want to go see Secret Life of Pets?
Was that Aunt Betty you saw on Animal Planet last night?
Because (a) I don't do sitting yoga and (b) you're taking up the whole couch.
"Quiet Stu, ""The Young and the Neckless"" is starting."
I'll never know why you find those human wildlife specials from the conventions so fascinating.
I do not find the conventions that interesting.
We are the silent majority.
"long day, ya know... it's a jungle out there!"
Why is it that I'm always the one who has to go downstairs to watch TV?
You're such a couch coconut.
The Geographic Channel is the only thing worth watching.
Forget the tube. Let's just neck.
She may have knocked down the glass ceiling but you still need to be careful.
Hi !
I told you those high heels would hurt your feet.
Have you seen the remote?
You really do miss Marlin Perkins.

"Really, a couch potato? I thought you were above all that!"
Is my neck too long?

"Discovery, Again?"
The Tree Channel will get you in the mood.
I'm going to stick my neck out and suggest we watch Human Kingdom.

"I'm telling you, it works better in portrait"
I'm heading out for some low-hanging fruit.
I wish
"Honey, I can't find my good interview tie. I thought you laid it out on the bed, stairs, and kitchen table."
In the mood for movie and a couple of longnecks hon?
I know its not healthy but tonight we get to look down at a retrospective on Kurt Vonnegut!
I don't care if it's the nature channel.
Looks like it's neck and neck.
"""Watching real housewives of the savannas again?"" They have such wild life styles""...."
"Game of Thrones is over till next year, let's go out in public.."
Chin up! Bernie could forget how to e-mail in four years and get a second chance.
Hand over the remote!
"You're 17 feet high, soon 18. It's time to get off the couch and hit the Serengeti !"
We should've ordered the tallscreen TV.

"I know you're not handy, but you could lift a hoof now and then."
"Are you gonna scooch over, or is it a nudge yer after?"
Channel forraging again?
Who needs a horizontal screen?
I'm still looking for a vertical screen TV.
You're quite the ruminant.
May I sit neck to you?
I always picture you reaching higher than this.
"So I guess I'll be watching TV behind the couch once again, huh?"
"We saw this, the zebra doesn't make it."
"I promise not to change the channel, so cough up the remote."
We should do something nice for the elephants next door.
We could be doing all those ads if that insurance company was called GRAFCO.
"Sure, roaming the plains of Africa sounds amazing, but you're not seriously thinking about giving up a rent controlled apartment in Manhattan, are you?"
"If you can't find the remote, YOU get up to change the channel."
"So where’s the low-hanging, fruit basket that was prominent in the brochure?"
Even I find his ideas a reach.
"Get that dreamy look off your face, Olivia. He's only got 95 spots! You want your kids to look like Holsteins?!"
I've told you a thousand times that your neck will hurt if you stay up watching Netflix all night!
"""No, we're not moving to the big city it's a jungle out there"
"Guaranteed, knee replacements will be needed."
Binge watching the Bachelorette is not worth a sprained neck!
I know a zoo when I see one.
So that's why we have long necks and purple tongues!
Nature doesn't come on for another two days. Are you just going to set there like some kind of human?
It looks more fun than necking!
You'd think vertical screen TV's would be a thing by now.
DO WE HAVE A GALLON OF THROAT LOZENGES?
I'm buying a convertible.
"I'm not talking down to you, I'm just trying to get you to use the sense you were born with. A lost cause, obviously"
airbnb said the TV is at eye level
Did you walk the dog?
The weren’t expecting this third party.
Well that's a stretch.
Sometimes you can be such a pain in the neck.
"Sure i like humans, but giraffes are funnier !"
"Honey, please stop watching this. You are just going to cancel my vote."
"You need to finish the leaf removal before watching the ""Jungle Book"", Fred."
Binge watching Animal Planet does not reinforce our reputation as a smart species.
We've been in all day. Let's go outside and stretch our legs.
If you move over we could watch Safari Planet and do a little necking.
Do you think my neck is too long?
"Jack Hanna, again?"
Did we make the right decision about this high rise low ceilinged unit?
That's the last time we're using airbng.
At least there aren't any elephants in the room . . .
"I know the rent's ridiculously high, but it's so hard to find a pre-war building with these high ceilings."
Why is the TV sideways?
"Wow, 70"" isn't really that big."
I sill can't believe you watch Life is Short
Would you get off your lazy butt and eat the lawn?
The aspect ratio is all wrong.
"Wide screen, flat screen, but they never got around to making a tall screen."
I don't think either party will ever nominate one of us.
We need a larger sofa.
"Well, they do say that television adds on ten inches!"
The jungle had HD.
"All day, it's telenovelas! You never want to go out for a drink!"
I know the tiny house sounds great but I just really don't think it will work for us.
"Oh I have seen this episode, the leopard catches Geoffrey."
How many ties should I wear with my blue suit ?
Need ceiling mounted once again I prove correct.
I don't get it. Why do they continue making them with the landscape screen format?
Did the paternity test show Larry is the father ?
Big deal—we break ceilings all the time.
Did you install ceiling fans in my man cave?
Enough with the 'Born Free.
"Time to move, the zoo knows where we live."
Orange is the new Black?
I hate to be constricted by this horizontal format.
Binge watching reruns of Wild Kingdom again?
I'm gonna get a beer. Want another long neck?
"When that show's over, maybe we could go out and graze some trees, get a little exercise."
"You've got to get a grip, Gladys... there's more to life than Animal Planet!"
How did you get in the door?
"Nature channel? No, that's the porn channel."
Up for a little necking?
"Hey, I just coop master's corpse up in the garage. So, what should we do next? It's matter of time before cops realize."
that can't be good for your posture
The TV Guy is bringing the stilts on Tuesday.
"""You know, Dear, I liked Bill Clinton's positive, upbeat speech of Hillary, but after the G.O.P. ""dumped on Hillary"" so bad, I think Bill should have ""stuck his neck out"" a bit and 'dumped the Trump"" back."
"For the last time, don’t change the channel with your tongue."
"Yes, even though you're not a donkey or an elephant, a third-party candidate could supercharge your modelling career."
First an elephant and then a donkey; wonder when it will be a giraffe's turn?
Did you hide the cookies on the bottom shelf again?
"Hey Baby, ya wanna 'neck'..."
Get your feet off of the couch
You're turning into a couch goose gourd.
I'm staying in. I have to catch up with past Animal Kingdom episodes.
We're moving back to Africa if that orangutan insults us next.
They need to hang it at the top of the wall.
Why is your TV sideways Jerome?
"Let me know when they have the ""Housewives of Nairobi."""
"Real Housewives of the Serengeti, AGAIN?"
...and then this drone got all up in my face!
I think Trump said we're going home!
Not another necklace !
Stop watching 'Real Housewives of Beverly Hills'! You're not getting you're neck fixed!
"But honey, Wednesday is my night to choose."
What do you mean you didn't reach your target?
Wild Kingdom is staged and rehearsed.
We need to talk about the elephant in the other room.
Did I tell you about the time I joined the furry fandom?
The screen is too orange.
"No, we're not getting a cat."
Looks like the race for the White House is going to be neck and neck
Again and again I told you...get tall screen TV not wide screen TV.
"Honey, I can't reach the remote."
I miss 'Tarzan.'
"You've been stuck on that couch for, like, half a gestation period."
Jed Falby just called—wants to know if an English bloke can win the New Yorker cartoon contest? I told him not to stick his neck out.
"Hey babe, how ‘bout you and me do some necking during the Jack Hanna Animal Adventure show?"
Don't strain your neck to get up.
Why are New Yorker cartoons always based on non sequitur illustrations?
Have you heard the one about the giraffe in the room?
We look better on cell phones.
"Move over, there's no room for me."
"Don't despair, every circus needs a giant"
"""We could use a larger TV""."
I would have made that Olympic team if I could only dribble.
TV shows the presidential race is neck and neck. We should be running since we're experts in that regard.
I've asked you so many times to keep your hooves off the couch.
You're not just my trophy wife.
"From now on, Esther, call me Caitlyn."
"I hate to disappoint you, but it's actually pronounced 'Jurassic World.'"
Lean over and change it yourself.
I have a sore throat that just won't stop.
Is this the only thing you can't do standing up?
"No,""High"" Definition does not apply to us giraffes."
"How about a tall one, love?"
I dropped the remote!
"I tell you, that new zookeeper at work really gets on my nerves."
I thought I told you to go eat the grass.
Did you find anything good on Neckflix?
Reticulated room for one
Now maybe you'll believe me when I tell you it's a jungle out there.
In the meantime the tree leaves will be curling up.
You're supposed to elevate them above your heart.
Darn if I know how to adjust the volume.
How about a little necking?
They're saying a third-party candidate may actually matter this year.
"That Rosie next door, she's such a pain in the neck!"
I am sick of all the donkey and elephant shows
"No, honey, I'd rather not spend the whole weekend binge-watching Neckflix?"
"Let's prioritize: before we get a bigger sofa, that ceiling fan has to go."
You forgot to bring snacks tonight!
Burmese humans try to emulate us.
Michelle looks taller in that color.
Is $100 an ounce too much for grass?
It's so nice to have a high definition TV.
Get off you high horse.
I’ve kept this secret for too long. I was Deep Throat.
"It's our favorite horror film, Neckrophilia."
"You need to stop binge watching Netflix dear, you're an animal."
That Kim Kardashian sure has a long neck.
How the hell did you bend and fold up correctly to get on that couch?
They talk about low hanging fruit as if that was easy.
Your getting spots all over the couch.
"I know you're homesick, but watching Tarzan reruns will only make it worse."
Not a fan of the widescreen.
I told your teacher you were doing your homework.
"Let me guess,tonight we're having T V dinners for supper."
I don't know why you watch these murder mystery shows. You know the lion did it.
"For the last time, it's not the wrong way up."
...So you mean literally Netflix and chill.
Have you considered IMAX?
That was Larry on the phone. A few of the guys are meeting up at the watering hole to watch the game - any interest?
Eat like a tree and leave.
You can reach the cobwebs too you know. Just sayin'.
"It's irony, darling. I can't explain it any better."
The doors are locked. Do you really need to see if the lion is asleep?
"We promised to stay off the furniture,remember?"
"This is my favorite. While Marlin races to the jeep to get more film for the camera, Jim is once again trapped in the snake pit with the poisonous vipers. What a couple of clowns!"
That couch is too small if you expect us to neck…
You're slouching
They call this big screen.
"Of course it bothers me, but as Ralph Nader proved over and over again, this country simply isn't ready for a candidate who looks like us."
The race is still neck and neck.
You can't just keep looking down on everything.
I wish these candidates could look at the situation from our vantage point.
I feel bad about your neck
Can we talk about the elephant in the room?
Maybe next time you can just hoof the bill and have someone come wall mount the tv so we can actually see it.
I say we switch to portrait view.
"Wanna watch ""Animal house?"""
You do know that wrestling is fake right?
"Why when I was your age, I would have been outside enjoying the fresh air, fleeing from ravenous predators."
"Have you seen my coupons for a free neck rub, dear?"
"Isn't that your cousin Gina in the Toys ""R"" Us ad?"
Do you intend to prepare supper tonight?
They say he's actually really short in person.
Can't believe I stuck my neck out for you.
I thought I told you to mow the lawn and eat all the leaves from the tree-tops out back.
``Housewives of the Serengeti'' again!
"With these necks, can't you just watch the neighbor's television?"
I tell you I tried. I can't get out the door.
It's not our cable subscription. Marlin Perkins has been off the air for thirty years.
Do these elephants and donkeys know everyone's watching them?
I told you the Tea Party wasn't what you thought it was.
Is Zoolander on yet?
I don't think there's a future for you in pornography – especially after watching us on Animal Planet.
Still hoping to find Mom on Wild Kingdom?
Are you watching your old Toys 'R' Us ad again?
They should of picked us over the elephant: we also stick our neck out!
I told you they installed it sideways.
Portrait or landscape?
"Are you are so tired, you need to lie down to sleep?"
I'll grab us a couple of long necks.
We didn't get out of the zoo just so you could watch Jerry Springer all day.
That Marlon Perkins still cracks me up.
Have you thought of rotating the sceen 90 degrees?
Why don't you get outside and stretch your legs.
"I knew we should have bought the 42"" by 72"" model."
All elephants and donkeys again I see!
Of course I think you are as pretty as Kim Kardashian.
All you ever do is watch TV! You're going to hurt your neck!
"You know, if you just mount it on the wall it will reduce your neck-strain."
They all have necklifts
I'm tired of just necking - Let's go to bed!
"Binge watching ""The Bachelor"" will never get you that baby you want."
Another Animal Planet RomCom ?
I wish you'd stop watching yourself in those safari videos
Are you sure it doesn't work in portrait mode?
Watching 'Walking Tall' again?
So you aren't even going to say anything about my new spot?
"You go to the store! It's raining, and you know I can't drive with the roof down."
"What are you watching?"" ""The Giraffe news, on the Giraffe Broadcasting Corporation"
And you think this is better than our lives at the zoo?
Just be grateful we don't represent a political party.
Turn off Animal Planet and do your homework.
Noah's Ark is so comfortable darling .I am so glad we decided to board!!!
The elephants and donkeys hired better PR firms.
Do you think she'll choose the Fantasy Suite?
"The Airbnb review was right, these ceilings are high."
"See, I told you 'Deep Throat' wasn't a Disney movie about a lonely giraffe."
How did you spend your day — on sofari?
best part of city life?....... no damn monkeys
Binge-watching Neck-flix again?
Would it kill you to put that thing on a wall mount?! Our necks won't be young and supple forever you know.
As if captivity wasn't a reason enough not to reproduce ...
Who do you suppose chose the TV aspect ratio?
"Oh come on, it's only a sore throat."
"Wide screen is OK, but wouldn't you like tall screen a lot more?"
Does it finally explain why we have long necks
It’s giraffe porn. 47 necking positions.
"Well, it's not the Serengeti, but it'll do."
You'll never see eye to eye with the donkeys or the elephants.
This election is neck and neck!
"Yes, Jon Stewart's new beard is oddly hypnotic. But I still think you should come graze with me."
I am fantasizing about becoming a ROCKETTE
I'm not sure it's healthy you're still watching old reruns of Land of the Lost.
Watch TV? I'd rather neck!
My money's on the donkey. The elephant has run amok.
I was laid off from the zoo today. The only job experience I have is being looked at.
"You sit like that for too long, you'll get a crick in your neck."
You need an ottoman for your neck
This is just what the manta rays are looking for. Wanna swap?
Gladys! I'm a giraffe. I look down on everyone.
"Are you watching your old Toys ""R"" Us commercials again?"
Do you not have a leg to stand on?
DANG... I told him AS the seat covers... Not ON the seat covers...
I think the TV is too low.
Did you fall in love with a virtual meme?
"By "" But we can't go back now, dear. This is it!"""
Stop watching this predator junk and put the game on.
I'm sick of you looking down on me...
I'm worried how easily you're assimilating to our new country.
Any tall tales on tonight?
Can you please turn that off so we can finally talk about the elephant in the room?
I don't think you're a couch potato unless you turn the thing on.
Just lie on your side and quit complaining!
Not tonight? Is it that sore throat again?
"They like their models tall, but with animals, they go for shorties."
Why do you waste your time on that low leaf eater waste land?
Why is it only my horns get reception?
Bad news. The remote fell under the couch again.
"Instead of watching all that stuff, you should be out on the Serengeti making it a better world."
"""This convention coverage is tough to swallow""."
"Honey, you broke through the glass ceiling long before Hillary."
"""The 'Legume Channel Network' again? Seriously?"
$100 a month and all you watch is Animal Planet.
We never neck anymore.
"I told you, it's Jurassic Park, not Giraffec Park."
The neighbors are growing suspicious. We may need to raise the roof.
You've seen every episode of Breaking Bad. How long has it been since we did some serious necking?
I told you to order extra long.
Now can you see why it should be on the wall?
"Humph, certainly not for me - living off-the-grid in some sweltering savanna."
We have reservations on The Ark in case Trump wins.
"Yes, but the wall will mean that we're ALL in a zoo!"
"Darling, we all know that the National Geographic channel plays favorites, and we giraffes always seem to get less air time than the big cats!"
"Now that Hillary broke the female barrier, I think a giraffe for president is not out of the question."
"Left or right, who cares? I want to hear more about low or high."
"I'll flip the screen vertically for you, honey, so you can see that video the way it was meant to be seen."
You need to tear yourself away from the TV . . . your room looks like a zoo!
It comes in clearer if you stick your head out the window.
"A little insensitive to keep using ""Neck and Neck"" don't you think?"
"Oooh baby, that Tarzan can really straighten your spots out, can't he?"
So far so good. Now let's check the bathroom.
"The baby is down for the night...most of him, anyway."
Feeling amorous? Wanna neck?
"If you keep watching Animal Planet, you'll think every neighborhood is full of hungry lions."
Maybe we should have sprung for the vaulted ceilings.
You're sitting on the remote again!
It's a jungle out there.
Wide screen does nothing for me.
Have you seen my socks?
You'll hurt your neck sitting that far from the TV.
"Ask the zoo for a raise, dear. We need a bigger couch."
You want some popcorn?
Let's order in. That door's giving me fits.
Those National Geographic shows always stereotyping us for eating the tops of trees.
Trump was right - this is the best ark ever!
Are you the same person who said she couldn't live on a preserve?
I told you they should have hung the TV higher
Hold your fire
"""When does ""Necking With the Stars"" come on?"
"See, it's good you didn't get that job as the GOP mascot."
"Are you still binge watching ""Keeping up with the Krustaceans?!"
The political conventions are getting hard to swallow.
"what do you feel like tonight, mimosa or acacia..."
"It's called ergonomics, Harold. Mount it already!"
Don't be alarmed. It's TV. They can't get you.
I can't find the ladder.
Do you really think this is the best way to stop looking into the neighbor's yard?
"As Roland Barthes wrote, wrestling is 'a sum of spectacles' so we're all being snookered. As for our next poetry contest, how much do you think we should charge contestants?"
"You love those longneck commercials, don't you?"
I knew we should've bought the TV stand!
Your watching Deep Throat again?
"Yes, I walk around with my head in the clouds. Don't we all?"
I hate FOX News more than Cheetah News
"Go ahead, watch QVC 24/7 if you want to, but you'll never see a suitable shoulder bag."
"You'll have to tip it horizontal to watch ""Giraffe Geopardy."""
"Err...Miss Jones, I'm about to stick my neck out."
A cup of hot coffee is already cold by the time it reaches my stomach. That's interesting.
"For the last time, can I please hang this over the mantle?"
"""Shortest Loser"" on yet?"
All they had were wide screens.
Ouch! That giraffe's house is way too little!
"Just because you have a big time toy sponsorship, doesn't mean you get to just sit around all day!"
"Do we get ""The Necking Channel""?"
I thought we'd agreed to remodel the doorways before getting a TV.
You're going to get a crick in your neck from all your binge watching.
If you're so interested in elephants and donkeys we might as well go back to the zoo.
We should have bought a long-screen TV.
Just turn off the news. It's a jungle out there.
Did you have giraffe day?
I prefer something more elevated.
We should really just talk more
Wide screens make no sense. Why not tall screens?
"I just registered a complaint about the doors, but - Good news! There's a resident chiropractor..."
I don't care for wide screens.
We need to elevate the discourse.
Don't you think we could have used a bigger screen.
"Please don't give me that look, we're therapy animals, after all."
Let's go trash a salad bar.
"The kids are all out, wanna neck?"
Wanna neck?
You paid $250 for that neck surgery and it's already getting mushy.
"If you just get up and go outside, you'd be ON that nature show."
Seriously? You’re gonna take up the WHOLE couch?
I believe what he said was too many embarrassing gaffes
They told me it had a long screen setting as well.
Are you sitting on it?
It's not what I had in mind when you retired.
This first story is a tall one.
Enough convention watching. Let's get nekkid.
Good news. The necklace I ordered for you will be ready in three years.
i caught our neighbors skinny-dipping again.
"If I wanted to marry a sloth, the zoo had ones next door."
They say they're tired of being called jackasses. They're looking for a new symbol.
I still thing it's silly for a hooved animal to own a remote control.
Do YOU remember me?
"Usual day at the office, what's on?"
I can't believe you're going to vote for that baboon.
I really don't understand how you watch this housewives of the Serengeti !
Animal Planet? Seriously?
"No, you can't order a scarf from the Home Shopping Channel."
We could sell this and get a tall screen.
"Don't let your head droop, too close to the television dear."
"Honey, the Curator got us front row seats for tonight's game at the Garden!"
How long do short necks take to evolve?
I've never been happier not to be an elephant or a donkey.
I bet you're sitting on the remote again!
"Hey, last Monday's dinner tastes wonderful!"
I am really hoping they will be surprised to see us.
Of course you're tall and thin enough to be America's Next Top Model.
Can you rub out this kink in my neck?
Animal Planet makes my spots feel bad ass.
"Really, no necking tonight?"
"Give it up, Geoffrey. They stopped showing your commercials long ago."
They're always wrong! It's not going to rain that hard.
Venti or Trenta?
Did you order Ethiopian take-out?
"Babe, I'm the only Bachelor you'll ever need."
"We don't talk anymore, Harold."
"Honey, can I PLEASE get a Lazy Boy now?"
I'm with you. I could watch the National Geographic channel all day long.
Stop watching Animal Planet and go outside.
I'm seriously considering hibernating.
See what the media does? These nature programs just feed your fears.
Just donkeys and elephants? Sounds boring.
I liked it better when we could see all the earrings and rings on those short-necked people.
Does this reticulate make me look fat?
"The front desk reassured me about their ""No Lions"" policy."
I hope Animal Planet doesn't keep showing footage of Uncle Joe getting drunk at last year's family get together.
You've got to stop watching Nat Geo Wild. The Wildabeast ALWAYS losses.
"Hey, you wannna have a neck fight?"
I can't find my turtleneck.
"Nothing to do with us, Honey, it's Donkey vs. Elephant."
Let's replay the part where the leopard goes ass over heels.
There's only ruminant for one of us on that couch.
I don’t care what it means. Don’t call your brother a camelopard.
You should have put it on the wall. Ten feet higher!
"Sorry, Bernie. That's not what I'd call a full-throated endorsement."
"I want a soda, but that lion is still hiding behind the fridge."
I hear you made center on the basketball team.
They reported you for overwatering our acacias.
I'm glad I'm up here and not down on that convention floor.
"Watching ""Cast A Giant Shadow"" again?"
"Don't tell me, watching the Nature channel again (ital:again)?!"
I agree. Giraffe Week would would enhance our brand.
Cut the tobacco wads and you'll have a picture.
Anything high-brow on?
How about a bit of necking?
"Sorry Love, Animal Planet isn't in our bundle."
Give me a break!... like a herd of giraffes could really survive like that in the wilderness.
"You call this ""a vacation""?"
"Your boss just called and said you were fired! I told you the ""R's"" were backwards!"
I've had it up to here with you laying around all day.
I’m afraid Uber only takes service animals.
Just call your spots beauty marks
too much television will stunt your growth
"Seriously, you ordered spot removing cream?"
These home movies just don't look right in HD.
This sure beats the Zoo!
Don't you think a movie screen is more our size?
"Unfortunately, Animal Planet is not part of our cable package."
I never felt Dolittle had much to say.
Stop watching that trash on Animal Planet - it's all gratuitous violence and sex
Congratulations. You are the first couch potato giraffe
"I thought you wanted a neck, flicks & chill evening."
The rooftop garden is delicious! And I can reach it from the bathroom window!
You said you'd walk the dog!
You look a lot more comfortable now that the elephant's left.
Just because I can see the tv from anywhere doesn't mean you can hog the couch
You never touch me anymore.
"Yeah, but I still wish we weren't banned from the theater..."
"If our neighbor calls me J. Ralph, one moe time, I may wring his neck!"
They never forget because they don't have our vision and rely on low hanging fruit.
I'll trim the trees if you clean the gutters this time.
It's bestial how low the presidential debate can go.
I think I swallowed the remote.
I just told the neighbor we were from Savannah.
Game of Thrones is a way better series than Veep. You can't even vote !!
"Humans... They think they are smarter than us. But if they were, they would be taller than us by now"
In my day there was no television - just monkeys and lions.
"""You need to get up, get real and get your head in the clouds like the rest of us!""m"
Be patient. It's going to take me a while to swallow my pride.
You know that's bad for your back.
My neck hurts - we need to mount the t.v. higher.
I guess it's donkeys and elephants for the next three months.
Accept it. We're living in a vertically challenged culture.
"So you still want me to mount the TV, honey?"
It's always 'Shark Week' in Philadelphia.
I promise we'll get a tallscreen next week.
I'm tired of watching people who think they're above us.
I told you we should have bought the L-Shaped couch.
I think we need to turn the TV the other way.
And I suppose there's nothing left on the tree to eat either.
"I don't know about this ""Jack Hanna"" guy..."""
"Next place, I vote for vaulted ceilings."
Did you want to watch Mutual of Omaha or Obama tonight?
I'm thinking of starting a third party !
This is exciting - he's neither elephant nor donkey!
I just can't watch the news any more. Its a jungle out there.
"Yes, I love the doorway...but my neck doesn't."
A long day at the office.
Get outside and graze with your friends!
"When I was young, television sets were small and had fuzzy pictures but they did tastefully cut to the next scene as the lions made a kill."
This year it's hard to identify with either party.
You didn't ask about the ceilings?
A little netflix and chill?
I'd like to stand tall with you tonight.
"Yes dear, I'm certain you'd win if there was an olympic competition for 'Treetop Chomping'."
Love to join you but I have the croup... hey... is that Marlin Perkins?
"This is NOT my idea of our ""forever home""!"
"Good grief, it seems like everyone these days has an acacia leaf show."
Let me guess: your mom called that she is in the documentary again.
I told you the conventions were a zoo.
"The heads are all cut off because they don't make vertical TV sets, only horizontal ones."
"Breakfast at Tiffany's, again?"
"Are you watching ""The Real House Shrews"" again? The news is on."
Bad trip man
"We'll return it and say we were looking for a 65"" VERTICAL Smart 4k Ultra 3D..."
"Watching all that TV is lousy for your knees, especially because of the way you insist on sitting."
"Just you wait and see, we're gonna shatter the ceiling"
"No, the movie I'm looking for is 'Jurassic World,' not 'Giraffic World.'"
Could we please watch something other than basketball?
"Did you DVR ""The Real Housewives of the Savannah""?"
They say TV hurts your eyes but this one is killing my neck!
"All things considered, I'd rather be in Botswana."
Turn that garbage off. Let's neck instead.
"You still have the same number of spots dear, even with this high def."
I still think we should have gone for the tall screen.
I don't like the idea of mounting things on the wall.
"Isn't this the episode of ""When animals attack"" where your cousin yells at that waiter?"
"Honey, the leaves won't graze themselves."
Both conventions ignored our platform demand for higher ceilings !
"No, the figures on the screen don't get taller if you turn the TV to vertical."
"I don't care if we live in Detroit, I find your enthusiasm for the Lions distasteful..."
"Watching ""Cutthroat Kitchen"" again?"
Really? Watching 'Walking Tall' again?
Must you continually binge watch Neckflix?
The bidet is broken.
I always found that show a pain in the neck.
I thought necking on the couch was passe.
I got you a membership in a jungle gym.
"Not ""Wild Kingdom"" again! Why can't you just leave work at the office?"
Can that monitor be re-oriented?
You installed the screen on its side.
Why don't they make a high-screen TV?
Man ... It's a ZOO out there!
"Darling, am I a moderate or a progressive?"
"I'm totally loving that whole, 'They go low, we go high' thing!"
I'd love to nibble Donald Trump's hair.
When they go low we go high too!
"It's nice, but personally I prefer tall-screen TVs."
Let's slip into something more comfortable.
Let's start a movement.
"""You should have got one with a giraffic interface""."
"Really, Mae? Fox News? They 're such a pain in the neck!"
It makes me glad we're no party's political symbol.
Watching Animal planet during the second day of our honeymoon! Are you homesick?
These modern zoos ROCK.
"Our time will come, that donkey and elephant can't last much longer."
I think we could at least go visit your brother at the zoo on Saturday.
I'll share the remote when you share the couch!
All right. I'll rub your Hooves. But no Necking.
Discovery Channel *again*?
You up for some necking?
"Well it so happens I'm nursing a bumped head, too."
Don't you think the high jumpers look silly?
There's no way out of this room!
How should I know how to turn it on?
Haven't you finished swallowing that Viagra yet?!
"You're right, the Giraffe National Convention has gotten less eventful since Trump's departure."
"Spoiler Alert: ""The wildebeest gets away""."
Don’t you ever get sick of Human Planet?
"You're right, it's too low. I'll call the Geek Squad tomorrow."
"No, you can't try out for the Knicks. You don't have opposable thumbs."
Do you seriously think they won't notice we watched a whole season on their account?
You look ridiculous.
"I agree, watching humans in their normal habitat can be uplifting."
I think we should mount it!
I THINK I'D LIKE TO NECK.
I told you. Only donkeys and elephants count.
Can you believe it? Hilary and Donald are neck and neck.
"Watch all you want...there will never be a ""Giraffe Week""."
This television binging is unnatural.
"You've already seen this episode of ""Hunting Lions."""
Four out of five doctors say watching too much TV results in increased herd culling from predators.
I'm not angry; just hitting the roof
Trump tower says no unless we're stuffed.
Great news: for a perfect viewing height just tie it in a knot! Makes navigating doorways a cinch too!
Tsk. Horizontal format... so uncool.
It's like Bernie gave us a Mountain Dew and now he's telling us to go to bed.
I'm getting a crick in my neck. Let's move the TV to the barn.
Spoiler alert! Only one of them makes across the river!
Those TV nature programs get us all wrong
I told you that we should have bought a sectional couch instead
What we really need is a tall screen TV.
Your selfies would look much better in portrait mode.
Any room for me? Love to do some necking!
"We are not couch potatoes! Now stand up, walk with me, and stretch yourself."
"Tell me again, are we more friendly with the elephants or the donkeys?"
You always liked balcony seats.
"You know, it occurred to me that it would be a lot easier for us both to see the TV if it were down flat on the table."
"Did you hear ""Side effects can include Stiff Necks"""
The Human Channel is too violent for me
I bet most people don't realize our 'spots' are really necking hickeys.
I told you we needed a 17 footer
"The kids used to look up to us, Fran."
Where did the throw rug go?
It's not quite the HIGH def we need.
"We could have gone to Rio, dear. Giraffes don't get zika . . ."
What happened to the wild life?
You're binge watching Downton Abbey again?
They only did them in horizontal.
"I still wish we would have bought the long screen, not the wide screen."
"Don't be scared, he just plays a lion on TV"
With Trump you're sticking your neck out.
"HiDef doesn't refer to height, dear"
Why in Hell would they put it on the floor?
Don't you think we're underrepresented in the industry?
How many times have I told you that we need a taller entertainment center!
Keeper says it's your turn in the outdoor enclosure.
A donkey or an elephant - hardly seems like much of a choice.
I told you to mount it 6 feet higher.
You're actually becoming a couch potato!
"Not ""Wild Kingdom,"" again!"
"No, I mean literally, I shattered the glass ceiling."
"I'm sure they mean elephant lives matter, AS WELL."
How many times must I tell you that NatGeoWild won't come across our Tulip
Don't watch those red neck programs. You've got too much to lose.
Are you hiding the remote again?
Housewives of New Jersey is utterly unsuitable for well brought-up young ladies.
The Okapi cousins are here.
We should buy a TV stand.
You've been watching too long.
Turning it on its end won't help.
We need a taller screen
"If you don't stop watching ""The Young Lions"", I'm taking the TV back."
If you flip channels with your tongue you don't even have to get up.
Animal Channel ...again?
We have to talk about the elephant in the room.
Anything good on the baobab tube?
Look at yourself. You need to get your head in the trees.
"So, did you get that pill down yet?"
This reality politics is wilder than the wild.
Get off the couch! I rented it through Airbnb and someone is on his way up!
Should we stick our necks out for Hillary?
"Tear yourself away, your dinner is getting tall."
They're neck and neck.
You don't think this hit-def thing's a scam?
I set the DVR to extended viewing.
I guess we're independents.
Look! That's Melvin from Madascar.
Binging on Neckflix are we?!
"Actually, this is high definition."
You know Attenborough gives you nightmares.
"If you're going to watch Animal Planet all day, we might as well go home."
"Sooner or later, we have to talk about the elephant in the other room."
Animal Planet again?
move over!
"Enough ""Dancing With The Stars"", boogie upstairs and clean your room!"
That's all you do all day is watch The National Geographic Channel!
Trump is quite a stretch -- just our kind of candidate.
Wanna get high with me?
Want a tall neck?
"Does it ""spark joy""? If not, just thank it for it's service and get rid of it."
Lean closer if you can't see it.
"It's not just you, Kathy. I look down on everyone who'd vote for him."
"Well, if I were running for President, I wouldn't stick my neck out so much."
"I thought I told you to turn the Democratic Convention off. Who do they think we are, some kind of zoo animals?"
I guess addressing the elephant in the room is an understatement.
"No, no, this is all wrong, I ordered a 'Chaise Extra-Longue' and a 'Tall Screen' TV!"
Like you'd ever make it on the Bachelor.
That thing will give you a crooked neck
The neighbors think we're Pokemon again.
Animal Planet has a show on tonight that has giraffe's in the wild.
How many times have I told you not to put your hooves on the furniture.
I broke another glass ceiling.
You just gotta get your head out of the clouds and join the real world.
I think we need to rotate the screen vertically.
Mutual of Omaha again?
Get giraffe off my side.
We bought it through Lending Tree.
So...Zootopia...again...
They say the camera adds ten inches.
"I told the genie I wanted a long neck beer, not a dear!"
Disney again? How can you swallow those egregious personifications?
We should trade in this old landscape TV for a new one that works in portrait mode.
"You know, we had to pull our necks in to get this place, but it's worth it."
It's 11 pm. Do you know where your tower is?
"You get much higher notes than those ""Voice"" contestants!"
I moved the television there so you don't have to crane your neck.
Really? 'Wild Kingdom' reruns again tonight?
Would you get me a long neck Miller beer while you're up ?
"It may be tacky, but we have to mount it over the fireplace"
That fancy shoe company has called again.
"No, YOUR'E scmoopy!"
I told you we needed a long screen TV.
Are the candidates neck and neck?
"Honey, why is the TV sideways?"
"Actually, I'd rather just neck."
"So, your fascination with Pokemon is over already?"
"Has the ""Slam Dunk Contest"" started yet?"
I really stuck my neck out for you.
"No, it is supposed to be horizontal!"
Apparently you ordered the wide screen instead of the tall screen.
Because they wanted an elephant and a donkey.
After millions of years of natural selection this is what you want to do all day?
The Travel Channel again? We've been to the Serengeti.
"I'm thinking a Long Island Iced Tea, how about you?"
"Camel backs are so dated honey, it's time for a sectional"
"Harold, you've been binging on Neckflix all day!"
No wonder your posture is so bad.
"I know the instructions were hard, but I still think we should have mounted it on the wall."
I hope all the flying pigs outside aren't gonna drive down our property value.
What's on the Necking Network Channel?
Cute!? He's probably only 17 feet tall.
It's tough being tall in a wide-screen world.
"The salesman said, ""for big-screen mode just lean in!'"
"Well, maybe just a little necking . . ."
Do you really think the donkey and the elephant have it so good?
I can't remain silent on this any longer...
"I know you'd miss your shows and the heat is a killer, but we've got a contract, and the kids expect to see two giraffes at the zoo. So come on! They'll put ice blocks in the pool."
Life's a real jungle theses days mom
"How many times can you watch ""Giraffic Park""?"
We better go before the people get back. They will not be happy about their ficus plant.
Are you still watching the re-runs of Giraffic Park?
"I can't believe I'm saying this, but now I actually feel bad for the elephants."
"""Seriously, another Lifetime movie?'"
We're portrait animals in a landscape world.
I've checked every store in Jersey and nobody sells acacia twig ice cream; how about some pickles?
"Let's have dinner now, ""Human Planet"" isn't on for 30 more minutes"
Care for a longneck?
"Derrick Rose has a bum knee, too, but you don't see him moping around watching Dancing With The Stars."
I've got a crimp in my neck from watching that small screen.
I know they're running neck and neck but it's dinner time.
These talking animal jokes never age.
Are you still binge-watching Animal Print Is the New Black?
We really need to get that thing mounted.
"Brad Garrett is very tall, but he can't neck like I can."
Real Horse Wives?
"I don't know about you, but I miss those crazy lions"
Aren't you glad we're not the mascot for any of those bozos?
You are so giraffeing lazy.
You're rubbernecking again.
You know the camera adds 10 inches.
"Hillary's no Dalí, but she paints a better picture than that orangutan."
why is the TV on its side?
That twit Attenborough hasn't a clue about true camouflage.
":I like watching tall tales, don't you?"""
"The Jerk Store called, they want you back."
"If you keep watching that tv, your tongue will turn red."
I strongly disagree with his position on migration.
"As much as I love the extra high cube walls the gang chipped in for down at the office, I feel like I hardly know what's going on in anyone's personal life anymore."
I want to watch the savannah documentary at eight. Aunt Jenny says her kids are in it.
"I know she's the first woman, but we've always supported the elephants"
"If they repeatedly refuse to include us in their party platform, they ain't gonna get giraffe vote."
"I think it's time we had the ""zoo"" talk."
Remember when we were thought of as funny looking animals? Wish I could say the same for this cartoon.
"Don't be fooled, 'a leopard can't change his spots' and neither can you!"
"Honey, you've gotta believe me - when I ordered it, I thought it the NECK-id Channel!"
The Sept of Baylor explodes and everyone dies.
Let's go out tonight for a movie and rile up the couple seated behind us.
"Yes, it's hot. But a ceiling fan will only make things worse."
All the chiroparactor's work won't help if you can't remember to sit straight.
Are the elephants still yelling?
I'm Nuts Over TV !
I sprung for the premier ark stateroom.
Dang! we haven't spent a single weekend on the savannah since we got this #@^&%/!! Netflix account.
"No, not another rerun of Animal Kingdom?"
That episode made me giraffe out loud!
"Get up, love, we're movin' to Kentucky."
"You really ought to stop moping around, and keep your head held high."
"By turning the set on edge, you won't lose her head and feet."
"Honey, I DVR'd The Great Migration"
No I'm pretty sure you CAN reach the remote.
reconfigure the height of the door and you won't feel trapped in front of the TV.
I was right. I told you we wouldn't turn into potatoes.
Did you at least try to reach the higher leaves today?
"Soooo Aerial, is that a family name or were you named after a type of fire truck?"
Not 'American Giraffiti' again.
"You can't spend all day watching ""Little Necks"" epidsodes."
You planning on watching until the cows come home?
Now you can see why human beings became extinct
Out of Africa?
"Since the flood, you just sit there and watch the weather report."
"How did we get here, Abigail?"
Get your hooves off the couch. Do you want them to think they had giraffes lounging around while they were out?
Hard day at work? Can I rub your neck?
The cooking channel is not what I meant by 'more domesticated.'
I'm just so tired of the silence.
Don't you just love our vaulted ceilings?
Enough TV. Let's stand up and go to sleep.
"Daddy, do you think maybe I could be president someday, if we can smash the giraffe ceiling?"
Don't worry. Jack Hanna can handle those Jersey Shore crazies.
Who had the bright idea to have TVs horizontal?
Dinner's on the tree. I'll be back in a few hours.
"Come ON! Watching reruns of The Redwoods of California again! First, you know we can't survive there and even if we could, we'd never be able to reach the tops for the tinder needles!"
"I miss the savanna, but I think I'd miss Animal Planet more."
"This apartment is ok, but the car's sunroof needs to be bigger."
I don't think the Hatfields will be too happy when they get home......there is giraffe dodo all over the kitchen floor!!!!
I liked our zoo better.
I'm a little concerned about the level of violence on the Nature Channel!!
Relax! It's just the MGM logo.
My therapist says I'm making progress with my acrophobia.
"Gerald, the conventions don't actually showcase elephants and donkeys."
Turn off the TV and let's neck!
What? You ordered sixteen neck pillows from QVC!
Wish I could trade these necks for some fingers on the remote.
This new television is head and shoulders above the old one
"I know it's better on the big screen, but we're not welcome in the theater anymore."
Why do you get the good couch?
Those 'performance enhancers' give me a stiff neck!
If put your feet on the sofa again and I'll break your neck young man!
Sorry I'm late. Got caught rubbernecking on the freeway.
Can I bring you a long neck?
I think you would find the viewing more pleasurable if you turned the TV on its side.
Do you think we'll ever get a check from Animal Planet?
"Now we are late, the ark left 10 minutes ago."
How's 'The View?'
High-def my eye. It's way too low.
Toys R Us is closing.
Which is it -- the elephant or the donkey?
"Let's stay in today, Doris. It's a zoo out there."
"Other than the low doorways, I could get used to this."
This beats the zoo but these doors are a pain!
You do realize that George Giraffe's neck is lengthened by CGI?
All the people trying to keep us out of captivity and here you are...
You left the door wide open and it's chilly in here. And now I'm feeling a giraffe . . . . . get it?
"""The other apartment was okay, but it only had 12-foot ceilings."
Tongue or No Tongue?
"I don't think we can be referred to as ""wildlife"" anymore."
Another name for couch potato is lion steak.
"To be stars, we need the TV vertical."
Scootch
Duh?! Donkeys and Elephants will never represent us!
Is this Giraffic Park 2 or 3?
Giraffic Park again?
Where have I been? I've been out running with a bad crowd of lions.
"Bad news, dear. We've been classified as illegal immigrants. And we're being deported."
What do you say we go scare some second story apartment dwellers?
We either need a taller screen or neck reduction surgery!
I miss the zoo -- the rent here is outrageous and the utility poles don't have leaves.
Turn it off and go eat your flora!
"""I'd really prefer that you say ""kiss""."
"How bout we switch it to Lawrence Welk, and neck?"
"All right Edna, at the risk of sticking my neck out...."
Do you see what I'm saying? We need a sectional.
You don't really think we look like Pokemons?
I've told you that I don't like watching these specials about lions before bedtime....
And you had to save the 60 bucks on the wall mount...
I can see we have arrived in the middle class !
"I'm sorry ,Honey. I called room service--but they're all 16:9s, no 9:16s."
Huh. So 4K doesn’t mean screen size?
"*whatever sound we make, but communicating ""get a job""*"
Elephants are Republican; donkeys are Democrats. I guess we're independents.
The door's broken again.
I'm tired of watching these donkeys and elephants. Time for a 3rd party.
Animal kingdom Again? I think your addicted to that program!
"Not to be a snob, but frankly watching the lowbrow fare on there is difficult for me."
"""Hey cutie, Ya wanna do a little necking while watching TV""?"
But you're the one who is better at changing diapers.
"So, honey, is the National Geographic channel still over-programming short-necked creatures?"
Just because you can turn the channel by pressing the button on the TV with your tongue while not getting up from the couch doesn't mean you should.
"You've got to get out more. It's ""Shark Week"" anyhow."
Does the internet really need more giraffes?
You know they'll never let you be on Jeopardy.
It's so depressing! No matter what channel I put on I hear about new walls and fences! We may as well be back at the zoo!
I suppose you'd like me to bring dinner down to you.
The Tree-Grazing Channel again?
Is this the one where they meet and run off into the Serengeti and live happily ever after?
Tarzan again?
Your definition of necking is different than mine.
"Hellooo, giraffing the sofa again!"
I am not watching another 'Nature'
I told you we should have bought the 170-inch screen.
"I told you to get the vertical screen, not the horizontal one. But did you listen? So now you have to choose what we watch: heads or tails."
High ceilings means high rent.
"Okay, so you're not elephant or donkey, but you'll be an ass if you just sit this one out."
I'm ready for chill (italicized)
I may have seen Junior in a weekender at Saks. . . I'll keep looking.
"Sorry I'm late , there was a giraffic jam."
Honey I can turn it sideways if you tilt your pretty face.
Animal Planet? Dear Lord. This is supposed to be a vacation!
Configuring an ergonomically correct monitor height is a pain in the neck.
I'm going to stick my neck out and suggest we buy a stand.
Your show is heads above the rest.
Of course you are going to get depressed if you sit here ruminanting all day.
Reality TV is fake. Let's go clean the garage.
I told you the contractor didn't know how to measure!
That'll rot your neck!
The olympics will really be neck and neck this year.
"I hope you're watching the Travel Channel, not the 2016 Republican National Convention."
"So, honey, are you still jealous the elephants got the job?"
What does that gorilla have that I don't?
I know—how can we cut the cord now that they added The Giraffe Channel?
Trump's Ark has a flatscreen! DVR of yesterday's Inauguration or breaking news on the nuke war that started this morning?
"""Can I get you a highball""?"
"Seriously? Binge watching the ""National Geographic Channel"" again!"
We need larger doors.
"""Let's get necked.'"
You know what I've told you about losing your eyesight from watching the TV 8 feet above the set!
I remember at your age for fun we'd get chased by a remote lion -not lying in a chaise with a remote...
He hasn't decided on our immigration status yet.
You're sure you don't want to mount it?...
Explain again how Bob woke up next to Suzanne Pleshette.
"I've got the next five hours free. Do you want that neck massage, now?"
"Honey, I'm up for anything tonight."
Wanna Neck-flix and chill?
We really need to get a higher-definition TV.
Why don't you get outside and play Pokemon Go like all the other kids?
You STILL can't see the lions sneaking up on Uncle Roy?
Do they sell high screen TVs?
"Ain't gonna lie to you, Beanie. It's a freakin jungle out there."
Try viewing it in portrait mode.
I think it's time you faced your addiction to The Real Housewives of the Savanna.
"You've got some neck."""
Housewives of the Serengeti?
"We may be ready for the big screen, but the big screen isn't ready for us."
How's the sore throat?
"Do be serious, dear, he's an uncouth wild animal!"
"I wish you could see far enough to recognize that Netflix is the new lion, and your lack of ambition is the new tearing my throat out."
I'm overextended
"Really, the Bachelor? I can't believe you watch these animals."
Are you just grazing the channels?
"So, why are you still here?"
"Short necks, short tempers, short attention spans."
No wonder your neck hurts - the screen is supposed to be at eye level.
You are a real pain in the neck.
Inappropriate ! Not enough nudity for your age.
"Uhh, didn't we agree this prescription was for medical use only?"
I would caution you not to put too much faith in those tall tales that Mr. Trump is espousing.
Did you use a mouse to turn it on?
For better visual effect keep your neck horizontally of turn TV vertically.
Why don't we form a third party.
"We need a tall-screen TV, not a wide-screen TV!"
I'm gonna grab a long neck. You want one?
"Speaking of tall tales, Hillary continues to claim she neither 'sent' nor 'received' any classified emails!"
Leaves. What are you the mood for?
It's called Deep Throat.
Trump makes the African safari seem tame.
"It's OK honey, the next president has no jurisdiction over the animal kingdom."
Raise the screen so it will really be hi- def
How did our ancestors survive the ARK?
Want another Longnecker?
"Billy's teacher called, Billy was caught necking during recess."
At least we'll be able to see over the wall.
Did Tyra send your sister off
"I hate sitting on the blue sofa! I had such a crick after that double episode of ""Serengeti Betty"" last week."
Sucks to be an elephant.
Your Uber is here.
Lets order Neckflix.
You'll pick up bad behaviors from watching the 'Human Channel'.
"If you're just going to sit around binge watching The Walking Dead, we may as well go back to the zoo."
The animal planet just isn't what it used to be. All I see are fish!
I'm going to the zoo. Do you need anything?
Hooves off the couch!
"""Animal Planet"" and chill?"
I find it ironic that I've been asked to join the Lions Club.
Binge watching David Attenborough?
"She broke the glass ceiling, not us."
"May as well be a clam, because you don't seem to use your neck anymore."
We could teach them a thing or two about basketball...
"How many times can you watch ""Out of Africa""?"
You never want to talk about the elephant in the room.
All these nature shows just encourage violence against prey.
I think a wide screen discriminates against us.
Widescreen just isn't us.
"Damn politicians, they are all a bunch of carnivores."
Is this the episode where the humans mate?
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say this speech seems plagiarized
"Watching ""Animal Planet"" again?"
The People Planet channel is definitely amusing!
"Phil, you said you were going to clean the gutters."
"No, I'm not high."
They call that a love seat...?
Have you started dinner?
"Airbnb is nice for a change, but I still prefer being out in the open."
"I've asked you several times, to take out the trash, but I see that you won't stick your neck out for anyone."
"Look Marge, I think I'm gonna go down to the waterin' hole and slap necks with the guys."
"""That ToysRUs trust fund won't last forever ya know."
"Can we watch the news? I am so over ""Wild Kingdom."""
"Serengeti, Schmerengeti."
Poor elephants.
Audrey Hepburn again?
"Eww, Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls. Scoot over."
I'll start watching the conventions when I start seeing some giraffes on that stage.
Management called me in today. They feel I'm always looking down on others.
That Trump is a madman
"I don't mean to interrupt, but have you prepared dinner?"
Stop worrying. I have been assured that no one will ever know are true identity as long as we remain in the witness protection program.
"I say, Gerald, have you noticed NatGeo shows us always loping and not sauntering as we normally do?"
I told you too much screen time will ruin your posture.
My dear child...we evolved to this...so we wouldn't need a remote.
"I can't believe we're breaking because you're jealous of a little girl who fed me acacia twigs. It's a zoo out there, Linda; it is just part of the job."
I swear ' The National Geographic ' said you have to entwine your neck.
Wanna watch Neckflix and chill?
"You know that the stuff that happens on this show isn't real, right?"
"See, I told you elephants and donkeys are bad influences."
Have it your way. We'll lower the floor.
Still watching Wild Kingdom reruns?
"The donkeys are boring, and the elephants are dangerous. What's not to like about us? Gary Johnson, we're available."
Please don't tell me the Republicans are talking about lowering ceilings again.
"This election is a real zoo, isn't it, honey?"
Are you done watching the people channel?
"Call me old fashioned, but do you want to stay in, watch a movie and neck?"
"No, I did not see Ze-BRA."
"You weren't listening. I said 'graze,' not 'gaze.'"
We _could_ just turn it on its side.
I don't feel like either candidate really understands our situation.
I'm going back to the zoo. I'd rather be a caged animal than a couched potato.
"Outside now, young lady. Those leaves aren't going to eat themselves."
I think the couple in 6F is on to us.
Get Giraffes of that sofa
The program says others look up to us.
"Honey, let's go outside and dance with the stars."
No . I will not raise the TV set .
"Is that the original Walking Tall, or the sequel?"
Let me adjust the vertical.
I told you we should've gone with wall mounted.
Let's grab a couple of longnecks and watch the game.
Mr Elephant called and asked if we'd fill in? He broke his contract.
We should really consider running as a third party option.
How many times have I told you to hold your phone vertically when you shoot videos of me?
I think we should have mounted the TV.
I can't understand your obsession with 'Tiny House Nation'
Do you suppose it was just chance that wide-screen TVs won out over tall-screen TVs?
Do you wanna watch TV or neck?
"You do understand that The Real Wives of the Serengti is scripted, right?"
Can YOU please go talk to the kids? They're behaving like wild animals again.
Didn't I tell you you'd be disappointed with Cougar Town?
"Yeah, it's disappointing. The conventions are over and they still have those old mascots. Maybe next round we'll find our voice."
Still ruminating?
"If you were to get a job, young lady, a trip to the Serengeti could be yours in a year or two."
Sit up straight. You weren't raised in a jungle.
Is that my orange-spotted turtle-neck sweater you're wearing?
"If we're going to neck, you'll have to move over a bit."
This new curved screen is supposed to minimize neck strain.
"Screw ISIS, the real villains are those guys on Animal Planet"
"Ah, the new episode of ""So You Think You Can Reach"""
Sure seems to me that the main stream media is human-centric.
If you were from Jersey like me I would point out that we don't need electricity. My tongue is two feet long.
Turn it off and let's neck!
Your watching Animal plant again.
They don't have a vertical control button on these new flat screens.
The Kardashians have really interfered with our necking time.
We never roam anymore.
"Let's watch it together and neck a little, too."
"""Attack of the Lions"" again! Can we watch another horror movie?"
I'm going to stick my neck out and call you a couch potato.
"Call me old fashion, but I do miss the antenna."
It's a savanna out there.
Didn't I tell you to buy the ceiling mount for the flat screen?
"I'm glad they chose an elephant for a mascot, not a giraffe."
It's a good thing we can go so high 'cause he sure goes low.
"No, you cannot skip Safari School to watch ""Katching Up With The Kangaroos."""
That's as high as it can go.
"Sorry, I'm late for dinner, dear, I got caught in a big giraffic jam on the savanna."
How was I supposed to know -- I though Deep Throat was going to be a movie about giraffes.
I don't feel like either campaign has reached out for the giraffe vote.
"Who got a rose ... no wait, don't tell me, let me guess."
Time to change the light bulb?
"Now that we finally got in, I never want to leave."
I wonder why Airbnb isn't more popular?
You got the the ultra wide? I told you the ultra vertical!
You know how these wildlife shows give me nightmares.
"""It's my favorite soap opera: As My Neck Turns""."
The Serengeti in HD sure beats the real thing.
Watch PBS and be more.
Somehow I thought life would be more exciting once we broke out of the zoo.
How about we turn off the t.v. and poke our heads out the door?
Is it just me or do you also find it strange that all these screens are installed horizontally?
"And remember, no lion documentaries before bedtime."
These boutique zoos are a bit of a stretch.
"But ""Real Housewives of Sub-Saharan Africa"" don't spend all day on the couch."
I think it would better if we mounted it on the wall.
It's been all about donkeys and elephants lately.
You sat through two conventions/
"Look, no one in their right mind would call you a couch potato, so don't worry about it."
Just because you can lick the screen from there doesn't mean you should.
"You miss the fresh acacia leaves, don't you?"
Maybe we should have gone with the wall mount.
"I told you, the news only covers elephants and donkeys."
What I'm talking about is structural heightism.
What's on Neckflix?
Salad? Again?
"Again with the reruns of ""Big World, Little People?"""
"Nothing but sex, violence, and reality shows. You really should stop watching the Wilderness Channel."
I prefer watching in the Portrait mode.
Why can't they letterbox the sides of the movie?
...and you didn't believe me when I said there'd be better reception here than out in the savanna!
Don't believe everything you see on the National Geographic Channel.
So how's the Sex Life of Giraffes Mararathon on Animal Planet coming along?
So maybe living together first wasn't a good idea.
"Okay, okay. I'll bring you some popcorn. But just know that if you get it stuck in your throat again, you're gonna miss the whole movie."
That door frame is ruining my neckline.
It's worse than a jungle out there!
"Why don't they come in a vertical screen?"""
The Fire Department wants to know who called them about a monkey stuck in a tree.
THIS is why we don't mate for life.
The neighbors want their gutters cleaned.
Would you like a double decaf expresso?
"You're with her ?! Well then, be there when they lock her up!"
Too many commercial spots.
Up for some necking?
We're out of straws.
Do you know when the documentary about Marshall McLuhan comes on?
Nothing new there. Just tall tales.
How the neck are you?
"If I could get rid of one thing in this world, it would have to be those pesky humans."
They're featuring Uncle Jeff on tonight's episode of Wild Kingdom.
At least we could see over the wall
Have you seen the remote? Losing it is a pain in the neck.
"""Out of Africa?"" Again?"
You never take me to the Serengeti anymore.
A horizontal TV?!? Have you been watching pornography?
Didn't I say no TV until after you cleaned your ceiling?
"Dearest, it's not only a jungle out there, it's a zoo, it's kill or be killed, it's survival of the fittest, it's like--hey, are you watching ""Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom"" again?"
"Well, I warned you that you'd get a shorter neck from watching all that TV."
"I telling you, Henry, if you don't start getting some regular exercise, your going to turn into a couch acacia."
Anything on GNN?
Noah invited us over tomorrow but it looks like rain.
Noah said he's building another ark. Turn off the tv. We've got to go.
"Yes, the HD is great but we could just go outside."
Place is great – TV is a little low though...
Stop being a pain in the neck and let me sit down.
If only we'd used the wall mount.
"Can you call me when ""Botched"" comes on?"
The Nature Channel should frighten you!
No wonder your eyes are tired. Giraffes don't have fingers and can't turn the TV off.
"Don't be so glum, I'm sure the new zoo will still have HBO."
You know the shows on Animal Planet are completely fake; all the animals are actors.
"Must you continue to watch reruns of your cameo role on ""Animal Kingdom""?"
You could've helped me with that elephant...
"Ever since FAO Schwarz closed, you haven't been the same."
I miss the old zoo.
I can't believe we fit that couch through the door.
These conventions are such a zoo. Wonder why they didn't invite us?
"Those neck cream commercials are for turkey neck, not for you."
"No, I will not admit that the giraffe on that safari ad has longer legs than you"
"Toys R Us was a great gig, but it’s over. Time to move on."
Does that couch give you a crick in the neck?
Mmm!! my favorite negligee! The kids must be at your mom's!
"We really need ""high""-definition."
"Be a couch potato, if that's what you want. I'm going to the zoo."
I'm glad the Hyenas had to cancel dinner. Let's watch that Nature episode where one gets mauled by a lion.
At least the elephants have it worse than us this year.
"And the best thing! If we lose the remote, no problem."
We should hang this higher up on the wall.
At least Trump is willing to stick his neck out.
It's your week for the remote and mine for the couch.
You're getting shorter you know.
I hate that the servicemen always install them so low.
Quick! Woody Allen's casting for a couch potato. Go audition.
Part of me wishes I couldn't stick my neck out for you.
Did you call the guy about the door?
Let's go dancing tonight.
"You're right, we can't fit through the door to leave, but that raises the question of how we got in here in the first place."
It's either this vast wasteland or the one we just left.
You never want to graze the bush anymore.
I told you we don't get People Planet.
"Yeah, but you can still watch it with a little imagination. The 'snake screen' was cheaper than the 'giraffe screen'."
Grab your keys; there's a tree growing in Brooklyn.
Ever wonder what our pixel count is?
"Ooh, is that a new Neil Giraffe Tyson series?"
I'm telling you that Nat Geo is scripted.
Animal Kingdom is not what I thought it would be. Ellen Barkin is scary!
"The Lion King, again?"
Want some shoots from the kitchen?
With the new wide screen we can finally watch giraffe porn
Don't blame me when all the good leaves are gone...
A little to the left...STOP...good. Now don't move till the show's over.
"You're watching that geographic smut again, aren't you?"
Need anything from the tree?
I renewed our passports....just in case...
We should try and leave as soon as the convention is over.
Wanna watch TV tonight or just neck?
So for THIS you sit down?
Is that really Bon Jovi?
tv again huh? I suppose no necking tonight
I pray he doesn't start in on us.
"Son, there's more to life than Meerkat Manor."
"Honey, you know how I feel about craning my neck to see the television."
"Cleaning the gutters was easy, but I still can't figure out how to drag the trash cans to the curb."
The hyena next door has his eye on you.
Turning it horizontal doesn't help.
"Well, did Netflix also happen to mention that sitting is the new poaching?"
It's a beautiful day out there. Why don't you and your brother go outside and play predator and prey?
I'll be impressed when it comes out in tall screen.
I wish we had a longer couch.
Looks like the game is neck and neck.
All I can find on TV are Donkeys and Elephants!
The aspect ratio is way off.
Bad news. I'm being transferred to the Serengeti office.
Bad news. Some humans moved in upstairs.
We are out of grass.
The Game of Thrones season is over. Time to join the real world.
Are you sure you wouldn't rather have a tall screen than a flat screen?
"Really Mabel, the guy from Wild Kingdom.."
"All that we have, we owe to Marlin Perkins."
There was more to watch at the zoo!
Good for you! Three weeks of taking it easy is the best thing for a sore throat.
I've always admired your plunging neckline.
Why are there no TALL screens?
"So, you're saying any time you get up, I can just grab your seat?"
Has he said high the wall is going to be yet?
Watching the nature channel all day is just going to make you more depressed.
Not bad; just needs a tad more headroom.
"Sharks, hyenas, and lions...Animal Planet should be more fair and balanced."
Did you the hear the Tigers accorded the street just got on the endangered species list? They're always showing off.
Can I have the couch? My neck hurts.
I don't think this kind of life fits us George.
"It's for you, someone from Toy R Us. He doesn't sound happy."
"Well, at least they left us the high-hanging fruit."
Again you beat me to the remote.
You're an insult to all self respecting couch potatoes you can't even lay flat!
What's up?
"It was the New Yorker. They wanted to know if we were voting for the elephant or the donkey. I replied, ""Option number three,"" and hung up."
The high resolution feature is what sold it for me.
The 10 foot ceilings really make this place........
Do you always have to watch that TV reality show about Zookeepers?
"Don't get so excited, the movie's not about us. It's the ""George Raft Story."""
"Ah, world's only living giraffe couch potato"
I told you we should have opted for the wall mount.
"If you believe the harness is real, it will be."
"Entertaining, yeah - but so low brow."
What's on Neckflix tonight?
"Like I've been trying to tell you Esther, you can keep looking at it from whatever angle you want; the candidates are FOR change, they're just not about to."
Have you even munched today?
"Honey, I really have a huge problem with your decision to vote for Donald J. Lion."
The vertical hold is off again.
"Don't sit too close to the TV, you will hurt your eyes."
You don't always have to stick your neck out.
"Well, that was fun... time for me to duck out."
Instead of necking all you want to do is watch TV.
I'm glad you found some highbrow programming.
National Geographic is doing a special on humans
It really gets cooking in season three
"Soooo, you want to - uh, what' s the word: spoon? make out? Give me a sec, I'll think of it."
If he wins I'm moving back!
Please don't tell me that the remote is under the couch again.
"Why don't they ever make a ""Giraffe-nado""?"
These human reality shows just bring back bad memories of the zoo.
You know their neck lines are Photoshopped right?
"watching wildlife programs is educational, but during the school recess you should get out doors and play more with your friends"
Donkey and elephant were already taken.
500 channels and all we watch is Animal Planet.
Watching the Wilsons going at it on Attenborough again?
Donkeys and elephants 2016... smh. I've never been so proud to be a giraffe.
So much life
I guess four stars and 'pet friendly' doesn't mean we can get into the bathroom.
Nature program making you homesick?
We're reticulated not reclining!
"As an African American the Oscars offend me, but I can't miss the red carpet!"
"Geoffrey, perhaps it's time you get a job and stop living off of your Toys ""R"" Us royalties."
Maybe we should have skipped the timeshare presentation.
"Oh, darling, no we're not the first or only LGBT couple in this building!"
I do hate when elephants trumpet
They don't even eat the rose Marge.
How about I mount it on the ceiling?
You care more about the Kardashians than your own family.
"Wow, let's vote Trump, if he makes President we'll qualify for deportation to Africa."
You were home all day and didn't clean up; we can't keep living like animals!
"I don't like plastic sofa covers either, but what I like even less are spots on the upholstery."
Why is it always wide screen and never tall screen?
"Geez, and they call us the circus freaks."
Beats the stifling savannah heat and that survival of the fittest run around.
The Chew?
"I KNOW I AM STICKING MY NECK OUT, BUT COULD WE WATCH SOMETHING OTHER THAN ANIMAL PLANET TONIGHT?"
"Coffee break is over, tourists are waiting."
We've got to do something about the shower heads in this place.
"Sooo, 'Neck'flix and chill?"
Human Planet again?
what were they thinking when they mounted this horizontally?
I stand corrected; the sword is mightier than the pen.
"Look I know the job search can feel overwhelming, but just start with the high-hanging fruit."
"By giraffe standards, Michael Bloomberg really is very short."
Maybe these zoo upgrades weren't a good idea.
I think we need a wall model.
"Come on show some desire show some innovation stick your neck out a bit change the channel , change the world then we can talk about a remote!"
Probably not-- Ivanka's dress looks better with swan necks.
"I know you don't need it, but I still would like to find the channel changer."
Why is National Geographic showing our home movies?
Perhaps we should have mounted the TV on a tree.
There's nothing on tonight. Shall we neck?
There were no tall screens.
Not another Randy Newman special?
What am I now? A man stretching his legs on a plane!
You're taking binge watching to new heights
"No, I won't wrap them in aluminum foil."
Some elephants stand for forty years.
Believing her has always been a bit of a stretch for me.
You better not have started the next episode without me.
I've had it up to eighteen-feet with your Nature channel bingeing.
Move over babe. This flick was made for necking!
Aren't you glad we're out of Madagascar?
We both need new pillows!
"Why do you find ""Dating Naked"" so awkward?"
"Look, Dana, I know you're having trouble with the move, but for the last time, there is no elephant in the room to talk about."
Did she eat the final rose?
I still prefer our life in the reserve.
Don't you ever get tired of watching 'Animal Kingdom?'
Giraffic Park movie marathon?
Stop worrying about what the polls say--Barron and Eric are paying for our hotel bill.
"As The Safari Turns was cancelled , that spot treatment you ordered from the commercial isn't working, Toto is having a free concert and I'm going with that light haired gazelle........"
You should try yoga.
"""I thought we were going to get it Portrait mode""."
"Apparently, head-and-shoulders-above doesn't get it anymore."
I think I'll stick my neck out and guess you're sitting on the remote again!
About last night.
"You know, when I was your age, we were never allowed any low-hanging fruit like the kind of bathroom humor you're watching."
Do you love me more because I've always been for women for all positions except for you?
I knew we should have gone with the 60-inch.
Mounting the TV would solve all of our problems.
I like it vertical.
You're in denial. The Wall is going to be taller than us.
"I thought watching ""Swamp Wars"" was beneath you."
George Zimmer in 2020?
I have no use for TV until a tallscreen format is available.
I'm for going high.
"I tried Animal Planet, National Geographic. No real giraffe news."
"You lazy ungulate, get those filthy hooves off the sofa."
"If Trump wins, we're taking an ark to Canada."
Why would you waste your time watching Elephant and Donkey Conventions?
I told you we should have mounted it.
Noah thinks we're addicted to Neckflix. Are we?
"Relax Dorothy, the people of this great country will never elect a cartoon caricature."
Have you seen my turtle neck?
Never in my wildest dreams.
"You know, it’s not the Serengeti, but it’s not bad."
Are you seeing spots?
I told you not to watch the convention. Those people are animals.
I oppose the media's unrealistic standards of neck length.
Excuse me -- my eyes are up here.
It seems like PBS is nothing but Englishmen.
Should we maybe have it wall-mounted?
"Housewives of the Kalahari Desert, again"
How many times do I have to warn you about the breakneck speed of high-speed television!?!
Told you we should have mounted it above the fireplace.
You look down on all the shows I like
Do we have to watch Deep Throat again tonight?
"We stuck our necks out to come up in the world, Spotella, and aspiring to be one of the Real Housewives of Acacia, I feel, is beneath our dignity."
"Come on, the nature channel again!"
"I don't care what we watch, as long as there are no elephants and donkeys."
"If our kind had vocal cords, I would tell you to vacate my favorite spot but since we don't, I will just motivate you to leave. Dinner's ready next doors."
hey bro
We didn't move to the city so you could watch nature shows all day.
I love the one where the antelope chases the lion.
Can you rub my neck? It's stiff.
"Pickles, ice cream, and a side of eucalyptus coming right up honey."
"Watching the Olympics, who do you think will win the high hurdles?"
"If it's any consolation, I feel bad about my neck too."
Want it higher?
Nothing on TV tonight. Let's neck.
Hee hee! When they come back they’ll blame the hairs on the couch on the dog!
"Quit saying, ""It takes a big man to admit he's wrong,"" about everything."
"""How did you get through the door?"" - William Davis-Greene, age 7 (submitted by his father Robert Greene)"
"Again with the Toys ""R"" Us commercials, Sheila?"
"Yes dear, with that many martinis you might be seeing pink elephants..."
"I tell you babe, it's a zoo out there."
"How do you watch this? It's just the same stuff, chewed up and regurgitated!"
Want me to turn the contrast up a bit?
Just because we can't fit through our apartment door is no reason to give up and spend the rest of your life on this couch.
"You know, when he insults pigs and dogs, he insults all animals."
Watching flat screen television isn't the same. Now that they did away with the long neck picture tube.
"Blend in, huh?"
"Yep, they say the election is neck and neck."
"It is bad enough they changed it to ""Nat Geo"" but I draw the line at calling us ""Raffs""."
How did you get that thing in here?
How was your day?
"Besides, you know the camera adds five feet."
This ballgame is neck and neck.
Let's start a new political party!
Move over Mrs. Potato Head.
How about we install the tv stand today?
Let's neck.
You're watching American Giraffiti!
You've become the elephant in the room.
Back in my day we actually had to stretch our necks out to change the channel.
"Honey, I'm going out for carrion. The Hyenas are coming over for cards."
"Ya wanna know how hectic work was today? I tell you, it was a zoo!"
Don't you wish they'd transmit in portrait?
There's no such thing as 'tall screen'.
Why aren't there any attorney ads promising settlements for our problems?
i checked with concierge...they don't have FOX news channel
"Mount it on the wall? Really, Carol?"
He says he's going to build a wall that's taller than us!
"Holy ossicone, I forgot to duck again."
I see I missed the boat. 'Noah' was just on.
I suppose you also have the remote!
I told you to order the 9 by 16 format but you went for the 16 by 9. Idiot: I'm surprised your not extinct.
"""I couldn't get it in Vertical Format""."
Don't even think of asking me for a neck rub.
You're not fooling me sitting in front of the television. You can't use the remote control with your hooves any better than I can.
Have you tried the floor?
It's all about elephants and donkeys these days
Ew! Doesn't it hurt to watch TV siting like that?
World's tallest mammals. Hah! Apparently we are smartest too.
I'm NOT asking Noah for a larger TV.
"It was only after I bought the thing that I realized that the ""high"" in HD had nothing to do with height."
"C'mon, we need to get to the zoo before the kids start arriving."
For heaven's sake don't stick your neck out for that candidate.
The Hunters said they'd be over for the big game.
National Geographic? You know I hate reality TV.
Does it really matter where the remote control is?
If we streamed Animal Planet we could watch it without the commercials.
Ya think the Cubs can do it?
Do you think you can adjust the vertical ?
"I don't think you're supposed to binge whole seasons on Netflix in one sitting with an anatomy like ours, is all."
I just heard I'm a finalist in the Animal Planet's cartoon caption contest!
"I told you ""high definition"" doesn't mean what you thought it did."
I just wanted to give you a Heads-Up!
How about another Spotted Cow?
They're making furniture so much smaller these days.
theynshould ave made higher ceilings
"You're sitting too close for your eyes, Gerald."
Did you know humans have the same number of neck vertebrae that we do?
We never talk.
I can't buy into these giraffe actors. They're so unrealistic - giraffes don't even vocalize.
"Hey babe, wanna neck?"
Don't you find it odd that all the movies on the ark are romances?
"Honey, you hav to stop watching these "" wild humans"" programs."
"Noah’s Cruise Liner is awesome, but the midnight buffet is definitely not for vegetarians."
When you suggested we live with your parents you did NOT mention that they weren't giraffes.
Did I just see Zebra climbing out the back window?
"Just think, before Mr. Trump promised us a better life we were stuck on the edge of the savannah, nibbling leaves off trees."
Call the desk and tell them we need a bigger bed.
"Melania, does my neck look small?"
"Sorry, I licked the satellite."
"Sorry, Animal Planet doesn't cut it for me. We have to move."
"Yes, you're tall enough, but how's your dribbling?"
So donkeys' and elephants' lives matter too?
If that one is elected we are moving back to Africa!
Frankly I think Discovery Channel has a distinct anti-herbivore bias
PG-13 refers to age not height.
They just got home. You'd better get off the couch.
"It's the pre-season, Doug. You don't need to DVR it."
This new wide angle TV does nothing for me.
Don't you love Airbnb.
It's hard to look up to you when you're watching TV.
"You're right, wide-screen doesn't do anything for me either."
"No, of course we don’t have sofas and a TV. We’re giraffes. But this is a New Yorker cartoon."
You think I don't know why you're watching animal planet
"Honey, let's turn off the TV and just snuggle on the couch tonight."
We can't keep ignoring the elephant in the other room.
"Could you lend me a hand in the kitchen, sweetie?"
"My favorite movie -- ""Get Shorty.'"
"Keep your head up, dear."
It's not you. It's just that we've outgrown each other.
"Chill out, Linda. The only really terrible lions I know of are in Detroit."
"No, long-neck bottles were not named after us."
"Carefull, watching too much TV can cause neck strain."
I thought you were an Independent.
"Junior, I told you, Wild Kingdom is off limits."
I'll sit over there so we can neck.
"Ohh, a 2 hour romance movie. Wanna neck?"
"Yet another 'My Squat, Short-Necked Life' marathon. Don't they know they're being exploited?"
"""Is that cousin Gerry on TV with Jack Hanna?"
I believe that you have my spot.
Can we run neck and neck instead of against each other?
Maybe if we turned it on its side...
We're never going to fit that couch back through that door.
"You can stand up now, Wilma. I've had the ceiling fan removed."
"Well I can't control the giraffic honey. But go right ahead, just Season 2 without me!"
Does David Attenbourgh always have to draw attention to our elongated necks... We get it.
Finally nice to see the animal rights movement enter the new millennium.
Maybe if the screen was positioned vertically?
It's got the neck room. Let's take it!
Why else do you think we built this place with 22 foot ceilings?
Trump banned us yet?
You can stop looking. I swallowed the remote.
Move over Baby and let's 'Neck'.
Try turning it sideways.
The zoo escape is all over the news. We're gonna need disguises.
It's presented in 87:9
To presume I don't need the remote is a bit of a stretch.

I need a chiropractor for a a spine readjustment.
Viewing kindred in all sorts of strange places.
"The witness protection program isn't working, I'm recognized everywhere."

We should live high.
It's high time we switch to Animal Planet.
"Wide screen, huh?"
I hope you're not ordering more turtlenecks from QVC
It was always my dream to play center for the Knicks
"Hey, he won the nomination. Not everyone looks down on him."
What do you mean I never stick my neck out for you?
Why are you peeved? I always stick out my neck for you.
I get the chills watching Dracula.
"For optimum viewing place base of television 32"" above the floor... I'd like to speak with the no-neck Gazelle that wrote these specs!"
I knew they'd get around to it: The Tall Channel.
Another night that I have to strain my neck to watch TV from the side chair?
"I'm addicted to Judge Judy, even though I know a kangaroo court when I see one."
"They're just elephants and donkeys, but it's still demeaning."
I say we get rid of that thing and go back to necking on the couch?
They say the election is neck and neck.
Let's get some beers in.
You never take the long view.
Why does it always have to be donkeys and elephants?
Won't Goldilocks be surprised!
"Honey, I'm thinking of having a neck reduction."
I hate the Sunday morning shows. The Donkeys and Elephants think they have all the answers.
Get off the couch with your shoes on!
Who says this isn't our natural habitat?
I'm waiting for Jeffrey to come on.
"You know her spots are surgically enhanced, right?"
"Darling, there's something mesmerizing about your interest in these tennis finals."
Let's put on a rom-com and neck.
"Really? 'Tiny Houses,' again?"
Stop watching The Lion King and audition for it already!
"What do you mean, you're vegetating? There's no vegetation in here."
The pizza was good but the mushrooms were strange.
"Please, get your feet off the couch."
DO we really have to watch the Giraffedashians again?
I still say they are damn dirty apes.
I've seen this one..It was the lion.
Sometimes I feel like we're vertical in a horizontal world.
"Yea, yea, portrait would be better for you but this IS landscape."
Turn it off! Trebek's going into detail about okapi again.
"Our home is empty without some nice, tall, juicy foliage."
"Ugh, when you swallowed the remote you left us with these endless shopping networks!"
I say we call now and order two of those bed pillows...my neck's been killing me.
Did you buy an adjustable stand?
"Like Michelle said: When they go low, we go high."
i was thinking sushi
"It's true, the camera adds three feet."
"You have your aspect ratio, I have mine."
Now do you know why I like N.B.A. games? There are a lot of tall people.
"Not Our Natural Habitat, But DAMN!"
Can you clean the gutters please?
It's pretty low for Hi-Def.
I thought these vampire shows were giving you nightmares?
"You know, all those feel-good speeches about sticking your neck out shouldn't apply to us"
You know we're sticking our necks out by not punching the extended warranty on the television.
Aren't you sick of ruminating?
Can you please just get a job? We need a place with higher doors.
The former tenants were pymy hippos.
"I swear, whatever you're seeing on Animal Planet is a doctored video. I've never been with anyone but you."
Why the long face?
What happened to us? We used to be so wild.
"Sure, Trump and Hillary are running neck and neck right now. But thinking that Trump can actually win is kind of a stretch, isn't it?"
I just find his views difficult to swallow.
Neckflix?
He now says the wall is going to be twenty feet high and the lions are going to pay for it.
"What do you mean, you swallowed the control?"
"Sure they make wide-screen TVs, but why don't they make tall-screen TVs?"
He sure made us great again
The Millers are doubling the height of their fence too. That must be some sale.
"I wouldn't worry about our demographic. We have more influence than numbers indicate. And, yes, we are documented."

We really should have rented that loft downtown instead.
These city life documentaries in high definition are great.
It is a tall order
Can you believe how bright his spots look in HD?
"World wrestling entertainment along with its iconography trumps soap opera, right?!"
"Why do you always watch these zoo documentaries right before bed, honey? You know they keep you up."
Do you mind if I watch basketball for a while?
Remember who you are. Think about it.

My legs hurt...we need to buy an antenna.
I told you it wasn't wall-mounted.
"show some loyalty , watch it in portrait"
"His Majesty, therefore, has proven once and for all that the sword is mightier than the pen."
I can't believe you sat there and watched uncle Harry get eaten by a lion on the Animal Channel!

How about instead of a wide screen television they made a high screen television!
Really?
I prefer the Elephant party but their guy reminds me of a Donkey.
"Yes, maybe we should hang it higher on the wall."
What remote?
Enough of the convention. Let's watch Animal Planet.
I had my doubts about Airbnb but this is great.
"Even for me, that's a stretch."
Animal Kingdom is not a reality show!
I'd prefer a candidate with a head on his shoulders.
Are you watching Pippi Longstocking AGAIN?
we have to keep searching. there must be someone we can vote for.

Thank God we aren't a political symbol.
Neck flicks again?
"Work at the toy store until you find something you like better, Geoffrey!"
"If you fall asleep out here, you'll wake up with a sore you-know-what."
We need to talk about the elephant in the room.
The zoom feature is broken... I think you can adapt!
A third party candidate? You are being ridiculous. The elephant may be taller than the donkey but it can still be the biggest ass.
Is Bernie Sanders on The Apprentice?
"Stop sulking, Maude. I'm not looking down on you."
I really prefer the portrait orientation.
Wanna neck on the couch?
"Turns out they did give us the biggest room on the arc, but the big cats got balconies"
"If you make some room on the couch, we can indulge in some sweet, sweet necking."
No big deal. You've been breaking through drywall and plaster for decades.
Spoiler alert -- the gazelle gets it.
I'm going to stick my neck out and say that Donald Trump just embarrassed himself.
and just where do you suggest I sit?
"Hey, remember when your parents caught us necking? What a scene."
"Watch all you want, but we're not getting a tiny house."
"If you buy one more neck pillow from QVC, I'm canceling the credit card."
"Hey, feel like necking tonight?"
Get yer affe (giraffe) off the couch
Can you at least help me with the hors d'oeuvres?
"Junior, I know all the cool giraffes your age have safari jeeps, but you're just not ready for one yet."
Let me know if you want that moved up a little higher.
How long have I been saying that this television is just not at the right height?
'Deported?!'
"I know he's ours, but we gave up our parental rights when he became a trump."
That Taxidermist captured her perfectly.
I think what we needed was a long-screen.
I thought when we got high-def the screen would be taller.
Really? Elephants and donkeys?
"First, it's $150,000 for a Harvard Law Degree, then $250,000 for a PhD in biophysics at Princeton. And, now, your goal in life is to be a minor league baseball team mascot???!!!"
"Seriously, Shirley. Giraffe's Gone Wild?"
"Not ""Out of Africa"" again?"
"It's not a midlife crisis, honey. The convertible is the sensible choice."
"No necking tonight, I have a sore throat."
No. There's no such thing as a tall-screen TV.
"You don't even know what a potato is, do you?"
"Forget watching the conventions dear, those damn elephants and donkeys do not represent us!"
Height alone won’t win you America’s Next Top Model.
It looks like you're ready to neck.
The cheetah did it.
Any idea how the remote control got on top of the trees?
"No! I cannot reach it, myself!"
It wasn't even close - he lost by a neck!
You can't refuse to face predators all your life.
The TV needs to be taller and thinner.
I think those Witness Protection guys kinda glossed over the 'new identities' part.
Have you seen my neck pillow?
I don't know how you can watch this newfangled television without a vertical hold button.
Animal Planet has turned into real trash T.V.
I think Donald is more like us. He sticks his neck way out and is very spotty.
Don't pretend you weren't watching those whores from Animal Planet.
I think we're going to need a wall mount
"Don't pout, I didn't mean it in a bad way when I said you had are giraffe neck."
"I like him on tv, but in person, Tarzan was much cuter!"
We're above that.
"Trust me, ""Born Free"" isn't for you, and it isn't the political movie you think it is."
"Honey, Noah says we really have to get going before it starts flooding."
Donkeys and Elephants get all the attention!
I think the aspect ratio is off.
"Don't complain, Noah's got the Zebras in steerage..."
Why don't you stream something off Zulu?
"I'd offer a neck rub, but it took three hours last time."
Get up. It's mating season.
But if we went to the game we would be able to see.
Not another episode of The Real Giraffes of the Serengetti!
Watching 'Neckflix' ?
"To be honest, I prefer the old zoo"
Next time we should stretch for a high definition set.
"""Your shift starts in 5 minutes. You should put on some sun screen before going back to the exhibit""."
Speak up!
"You know you're becoming a ""couch potato"" and from what I've read...it could stunt your growth...so I would think about that..."
"I know that you said don't stick your neck out, but what could I do?"
"Stop sulking. You're the one that insisted we move to a condo in Boca. """
Thanks for getting the elephant out of the room for me.
You're watching The Real Okapi of New York City again?
Ohio looks so fascinating. Those were your words.
"Next time we migrate, can we not use Airbnb?"
"If you hide out in here all day, the jackals have won."
"Before you buy a ceiling fan, measure the clearance."
I guess you could say I'm a little horny.
'Naked and Afraid'? Again?
Darwin'so got to be rolling over in his grave.
The RNC is a zoo.
It's another ground breaking humanlife documentary; this week from Philadelphia.
Democracy doesn't exist.
Let me guess: Lion Week?
Are you going to vote for the elephant or the donkey?
"Well, it beats me Daphne, how they have the cheek to call that thing High Definition ."
I didn't think witness relocation would be like this.
I think I'd rather be a jackass than vote Republican this time.
"Sure, wide screen's great but what about tall screen?"
Are we better off than we were four years ago?
"Don't forget, we're having high tea with the Fitzgeralds at 3pm."
We can’t wait another 10 minutes. I already set the ceiling for dinner.
"Mitchell, I thought the orthopedist told you to mount that thing higher."
I watch only high def.
Let's watch reruns of Human Planet!
"""I warned you it would make your neck look huge""."
Admit it... you won't be happy until we get a TV screen with higher resolution...
No remote needed
"Honey, have you seen my scarf?"
Still binging on Human Planet?
Wanna just sit on the sofa and neck?
I told you to get a TALL screen.
Soooo…Neckflix?
"A new TV, with a larger screen? Just lean in."
That speech settles it. There's no way I'm voting for Godzilla.
"Really, Bernice, you look sexy in pixels."
'Hatari' again?!
Come outside. I want to show you something on the roof.
"Should have gone with ""tall screen"" instead?"
"Do you want a bowl of acacia leaves, popcorn, or $1.00 slice pizza?"
Its a beautiful day... why don't you go outside and hunt for Pokemon
Could you move up a bit?
How bout a longneck ?
"You've got to stop watching reruns of ""Extreme Makeover"". Face it, in this political climate we're never going to be allowed to use the men's OR the women's bathrooms."
Is it just me or are the ceilings getting lower?
But it's the hometown visits!
Can we please watch something besides the National Geographic Channel tonight?
Is it the meeting of the donkeys or the elephants this week?
I hope Hillary does get rid of that glass ceiling.
I told you to buy a wall mount!
Penguin? Might as well vote elephant.
"Shark Week, darling?"
So what do you think of that ark deal????
Can't you wall mount the TV?
I doubt the shopping channel has anything in your size.
This election cycle is starting to be a pain in the neck!
"Long day, honey?"
CSI: Africa? Really?
"We were once young and restless, weren't we, Geraldine?"
These David Attenborough docos are just so retro.
"With a little effort, you wouldn't need the remote"
Isn't there anything on besides National Geographic?
"You know if he's elected, we're getting deported, right?"
Too much necking at Fox News.
"Oh, sure, if it weren't for our ancestors breaking through the grass ceiling all those generations ago, we wouldn't live as we do. So why do I still feel there should be more to evolve to than this?"
"You'll see, it's our turn now. People are really sick to death of elephants and donkeys."
This convention's more depressing than LionWeek.
"You think with Hillary's winning nomination, it is me instead of you who should go to cook?"
"I know his neck is long enough to win your vote, but he may send us back to Africa..."
"They're showing 'Jurassic Park,' honey, not Giraffic."
Our party needs a voice.
"""Yes - Oprah has a small neck - but you're you!"
You have to use the vertical control button.
"Every day it gets more difficult"" to hold my head up."""
"Oh please, stripes always make you look vulnerable"
Who's up for a little necking?
They say it's her first glass ceiling.
"Don't worry honey, we can mount it on the wall."
Sweetie have you seen my polka dot pajamas?
The polls say they're neck and neck.
Face it - we're vertical viewers in a horizontal world.
"Aren't you getting tired of watching the"" The Real Giraffe's of New Jersey?"""
This is the last time I'll overlook your behavior.
Go outside and pick some leaves. You've been sitting around here all day.
Are you sitting down?
Our high definition is better than those liquid crystals on that screen. After all we were picked for the ToysR Us logo!
"I do not want you to leave the room, yet."
I don't need wide screen; I need tall screen.
"Live! From Great Neck, New York! It's Saturday Neck Live!"
I always told you that we could rightfully look down on those elephants and donkeys.
"The ceilings are low, and the internet access isn't great, but I do like the no-hyenas policy."
"When the Lion eats the cameraman they won't seem so"" Born Free Beautiful""."
"Damocles, Mr. Trump has responded to your advice by way of a TWEET, which reads: “You’re a loser and your wife’s a fat pig - #BadDecision #Dionysus - ya gotta hand it to him"
You are watching the long jump aren't you?
Anything appetizing on Wild Vegetable Network?
"I agree. There just aren't that many good giraffe movies, but what can we do about it?"
You're becoming a couch zucchini
Ever watched Human Planet? It's a circus.
Don't you ever get tired of watching funny giraffe videos?
We should have bought the wall mount.
Can I get you something? How 'bout a longneck?
I checked the fridge. We have some longnecks.
When are they going to make Tall screen TV?
Perhaps if we stood it up on its side?
"""They didn't have stilettos my size""."
"Good news....they said if I can do something about my height, I've got the job."
"Alright, Linda. You win. This isn't funny anymore. Can we go home now?"
If Trump wins we're moving back to Kenya!
"Hill, it's in the BAG!"
"White wine or a long neck ""That's not what I meant when I offered you a longneck."
"You're right, this is a nicer zoo."
I'm not the only one around here who can forage.
"Yes, it's a shame. But ultimately even our necks show our age."
Yes — but if he wins we'll probably be deported.
"Now, can we talk about the elephant in the room?"
It's not fair that only Ostriches are allowed to bury their heads in the sand
Neckflix and chill?
This love seat seems to have a mal-function.
Are you watching that human planet channel again?
"What is it about ""Place monitor at eye level"" that you don't get?"
Can't you just switch it to portrait mode?
Do the security cameras still show the lions out there?
"I'm gonna go grab a couple of long necks, want anything?"
"If they score, please…no more holes in the ceiling."
'I'm with her?' What about us?
"Yes, that's how they neck."
We can stay at the zoo when we compete in Rio.
I agree it makes no sense; but they only come in horizontal.
Maybe we could rotate it 90 degrees.
I am trying to learn something about Africa in case Trump becomes the next president
How many times must I tell you not to put your feet on the couch?
"Well, well, well! Aren't you the couch potato!"
A camel's got the penthouse but there's a two bedroom on a high floor with a view of Central Park.
Still watching that nature documentary about giraffes?
What brought you to this neck of the woods?
Really? A horizontal screen?
Do you got the remote?
"If it were up to me, I'd watch in high-def."
Animal planet is on ch.43
Is this better than the zoo? Here we have to worry about the rent.
"Yes, I'm suggesting a wall mount."
You got to stop watching Keeping up with the Kardashians on Human Planet.
I'm too tired for necking; let's just have sex.
A stiff neck ? I'll call the doctor again .
Doesn't he remind you of the hyena we outran in 2011?
They asked me to limbo at the office party. We need to start up Tall Lives Matter!
Quit roominating!
"Come on Honey, if we get off the couch, you can look for Pokémon."
"But giraffes are High Definition, by definition!"
Do you remember the first time we necked ?
"Before we watch this, let me get us a couple of beers from the fridge. Do we have any longnecks?"
"I know it's not as nice as the Cineplex, but it beats hearing ""Down in front!"" over and over again!"
"Well, the kids are at camp. Wanna neck?"
Need the remote?
I told you cork flooring would be too thick
"That stupid Animal Planet again? Look, they don't even know we talk and keep house!"
"Really, you can't reach?"
Watching human mating documentaries on Cinemax again?
You promised things would be different once we left the zoo.
"Call me old-fashioned, but I say we just stay home and neck."
"Congratulations, Geoff, you've become the species' first couch giraffe."
Go outside and roam.
Why don't they make a long TV?
"Gladys, you said if we moved to the city, we’d ""live"" a wild life, not watch it."
A reality show about Giraffes living in the Jungle? That is so absurd!
I told you we should get a taller television stand!
I had a few twigs for lunch and fixed the signal problem.
I'm tired of necking. Let's get down to business.
"It's called ""Naked and Afraid."" They haven't a clue."
Let's turn this off and neck.
Leaves don't grow on TVs.
I don't think we should get the ceiling fan.
I love the high ceilings but I still wish we had granite counter tops.
"Your day? How about ""The weather is fine."" 1000 times a day."
"Hey, I've got some longnecks in the fridge, want one?"
"It's a black tie affair, I'd wear the 96 inch."
This place reminds me of our camping trailer.
"Sorry honey, I don't think they do tall screen TV."
Animal Planet is so idealistic.
Makes you glad you're not an elephant.
How about we mount it up on the wall?
I'm not sticking my neck out for you again.
"No, we weren't represented at either convention."
"Since we moved to the city, I can't even remember what it means to be reticulated anymore."
I will never understand why coffee gets cold once it reaches my stomach!
"If he wins, we're moving to Kenya."
Honey i really do want to know your feelings...but sometimes I get overwhelmed and need to stick my head out the car window.
"The do make wall mounts, you know"
"Well, who made the magic go out of our marriage--you or TV?"
Your time is up.
I told you we should have gotten the wall mount.
"Where did you go Harold?"" ""Martha, HDTV is so life like. I saw the lion attacking so I ran--ran straight into the kitchen wall."
Wear your glasses before you strain your neck.
Let's turn off the TV and neck a little.
"Of course I appreciate the new ceiling, but what about the problem with the door."
You're addicted to Human Planet since Trump came along.
"Those were gaffes. Trump made a lot of gaffes. Besides, we can't vote; only elephants and Donkey Kong."
Carol if you don't look at me I'm walking straight out that door
I've been recruited by a drug cartel.
I ate the last bagel.
Aren't you glad we are Libertarians?!
Did you have problems getting through that door?
Let's do a little necking before the kids get home.
You know that those scenes in Wild Kingdom are fake
We are not Party animals.
I still say you need to turn the screen sideways for specials about us.
Hooves off the sofa!
Since you got fired by Toy's R Us all you do is lay around and binge watch Netflix all day.
Will you marry me!
"Turn off the TV, sweetie, and let's neck!"
I get it now - a taste of my own medicine. This will take me some time to swallow.
Our compassionate political natures are head and shoulders above those elephants and donkeys.
The aspect ratio is not aesthetically pleasing.
Don't bother getting up - you always put the salad way down in the bottom drawer anyway.
Wide screen is fine but I wish they'd make a tall one.
"Honey, even though we live in Great Neck,NY, cozying up and necking with you is a tall order."
The sore throat from all the booing is nothing compared to the post-nasal drip of the elephant at the GOP convention.
"You have to stop watching Animal Planet, and go out and see for yourself."
Maybe you can scoot over a bit?
Noah can kiss my butt.
I always thought giraffes are better than donkeys and elephants.
Your grandparents wouldn't have called these low ceilings.
"It's very nice, but you should have gone with a tall screen"
My folks won’t be home for an hour. Let’s neck.
Are you coming to the watering hole or are you just going to sit here and watch bloody David Attenborough all day?
"No worries, we'll be able to see over the wall."
Bad news. I got replaced by a Pokémon down at Toys 'R Us.
"Very nice purchase dear, but how the hell are we going to use a remote?"
I feel skittish. There's a lion sitting in a parked car across the street.
You've been sitting on that couch ever since we got turned into giraffes.
"Aw, look, it's ""Born Free."" Wanna neck?"
"Well, if they deport us at least we'll be able to see over the wall."
How come we never talk ?
"l may be sticking my neck out, but I think you need to look for a job."
Noah really undersold the amenities.
Neutral furniture is perfect for our pattern!
Watching Human Planet again?
National Geographic promised they were gonna edit this part out.
My dear. Why ever do you have the television sideways?
Did you really think elephants making a fool of themselves on TV was going to be funny?
"You know just leaning in on the iPad has the same effect, right?"
Bye sweetie and don't forget to gargle.
What a relief not to be elephants or donkeys!
The elephant is in the refrigerator. So that's done.
Would you like to watch a documentary about human evolution?
Let me guess - Trump and Clinton are neck and neck in the polls!
There's never anyone who looks like us at the Republican convention.
"There's not going to be a third party, and you're not going to be the mascot."
I have to find a job with a higher ceiling.
Rabbit ears work better.
Would a Serengeti Sofa make you feel less homesick?
Don't you love David Attenborough's voice.
"Steve, is it too much to ask..... maybe a night out every once in awhile?? Heather told me about this fabulous Acacia tree that she found near Fourth and Main."
"Get off the couch, it's a jungle out there."
"We talked about this, Harold - no shoes on the couch."
"Maude, if you tilt your head a bit to the left, I'm sure the reception will improve."
"Honey, I'm having an affair."
I'm done with this convention zoo
Now do you see why we're barred from Rio 2016?
"No, honey, I don't want to keep up with The Giraffians."
How could we have let David Attenborough talk us into mating on camera?
I think we've finally got to the low-hanging fruit of living in a city
Cecil hasn't been showing up to work lately.
I get that you went on strike after Harambe's death but it's been two months. Get a job.
How did they get the TV through the door?
"The next time we commit to a furries fantasy weekend, let me pick our costumes."
"Watch the convention if you'd like, but they won't really change their stripes."
"If you sit that close, you'll strain your neck."
Spoiler alert! The hyena did it.
It's perfect if you want to fall asleep watching television!
Let's go down to the bar for a drink. The high balls are on me.
"He says he will fight for all citizens - Latino citizens, women, orphans, LGBTQ citizens, the elderly citizens.....But will he fight for giraffes, that's what I want to know !"
You really should not sit so close to the TV
I Love this movie ... it's Meryl's best performance ever.
"You're not watching one of those Attenborough horror films again, are you?"
Are you kidding me? They chose an elephant and a donkey over us?
"What's so fascinating about a Mr. Ed rerun?"""
I feel like this part of the jungle is becoming too gentrified.
"Tiger or zebra, but giraffe just isn't ""In."""
"When it's over, then can we neck?"
"It was a good speech, but she didn't say anything about giraffes."
"Bad news honey, the landlord is charging by the foot."
"Landscape vs. portrait really isn't a choice for us is it, Muriel?"
"Just because Toys R Us is closed, doesn't mean you give up Geoffrey."
"'Neckflix and Chill' doesn't mean the whole weekend."""
"We need a tall screen, not a wide screen."
Time to upgrade to a tall screen.
I told the zookeeper he gets his house back when we get more acacia leaves.
I'm working on getting Nature to do a special on us...
I'm surprised Dracula movies don't scare you more.
What else is on the Food Chain Channel ?
"I'm sorry but we've watched the program twice and they just didn't use the clip were you shouted out ""Baba-booey""."
"No, my dear, it's the movies that got small."
It's not a preserve but it's better than the chickens have it.
"Don't fall asleep in front of the couch, again. You'll wake up with a stiff neck."
Can I get you fifteen pillows?
"Did the realtor say co-op, or coop?"
"Your mother is on the phone, and she says that the lions are stalking her again."
"I don't care how long you watch that nature sow, the lions are still out there."
I need you to mow the savanna today.
"Stop watching TV, get off your ass, and get down to the watering hole where you belong."
I like it at about eye level. What about you?
Do you think we should have gotten the vertical screen?
I feel like Hillary really 'gets' our ceiling issue.
Which is it...The Real Housewives of Kenya or Zimbabwe?
Don't you wish they made tall screen TVs ?
"No, vampire movies make me uncomfortable."
"No, watching Wild Kingdom isn't the same."
"""Not 'Wild Kingdom,' again?!"" [To the editor - please print the word ""again"" in italics.]"
Don't tell me you're still watching little Donald.
Your T V Dinner is on the roof.
Your options are (1) watch baseball; (2) score a home run while necking.
And he doesn't shed?
I'm taking it back -- even in widescreen mode we get cut off at the neck.
Not so well for the old book club. Now are you glad we moved here?
It's time to go to the Convention!
"Yeah, but you rarely leave the apartment!"
There's no way her neck is real.
Another one of your wild game shows?
I happen to like vertical video.
"If I have to watch one more Giraffian have her neck augmented, I'm going to run out this door without ducking!"
You always look down on whatever it is I want to watch. I've had it up to here.
How about a high ball before dinner?
Phooey with the news. Why don't we just sit here and neck.
I feel uncomfortable - I don't think we can afford this.
Sure beats our 'natural habitat' exhibit.
We'll just have to put up with the ceilings.
Wall mount I said. No you said.
"I know it's a lot smaller than our old place, but dammit -- we've got hi-def!"
The store ran out of extra-tall wall mounts.
"You do know the virtual migration is just around the corner, don't you?"
Is this the nature channel or the food channel?
I don't mean to look down on you.
"Just because they're acting like a bunch of wild animals, doesn't mean we have to."
I told you not to lower yourself to human comforts and pleasures.
"Kung Fu Panda, Gorillas in the Mist, Angry Birds, or Finding Trump?"
"You just don't get aspect ratio, do you?"
Can we talk about the elephant in the other room?
I'm tired of sticking my neck out for you!
Aren't you tired of seeing the same old faces on the Nature channel?
That's not a giraffe. That's Audrey Hepburn.
'Zoolander'? It's not what you think.
"I don't know about you, but I'm fed up to my neck with politics!"
These cartoons are so unrealistic.
"No, I don’t think poachers are just misunderstood bad boys."
Still no articulated bachelorette?
let’s turn off the TV and do a little necking.
Don't you miss sitting on our balcony watching our nutty neighbors?
"OK, so we'll move it back above the fireplace."
Wanna make some little horsies?
"Yes, Donald Trump is orange but that's no reason to vote for him."
I think it's more than a little sick that you're watching The Hunt.
The Ad states it's High definition.
How about Casablanca and alotta neckin?
We've gotta mount this over the mantel!
I TOLD you we should've asked more questions about this place instead of assuming that Congo autocorrected to condo.
"Honey, I've decided to leave the zoo to become a third-party mascot."
'Planet Earth'? You watch too much reality television.
The kids still at the zoo?
This election is going to be neck and neck.
Be nice if they made these TVs in a vertical leterbox format!
I think you need to see how the other half lives.
"Can we skip the Nat Geo channel tonight and watch ""Wheel of Fortune"" instead?"
"There's really no point in opening the door for me, dear."
"Serengeti, Shmerengeti! What's on cable."
I'm always sticking my neck out while you relax
Little House on the Savannah will be on after a word for our sponsor.
I don't want to be antennae! Your turn.
Seems like the wrong orientation for HDTV
What's the score?
I'm going to the store for beer--we're out of long-necks.
Where did the elephant go?
I'm glad we don't live in a car.
"""Animal Kingdom"" again?"
"It's o.k., but I liked our old tall-screen t.v. better."
Of course she has a nice loooong neck. You can tell she had some work done.
This is just like watching the monkeys throw poo at each other.
Shall I go and get a longneck?
I don't see a candidate that I would stick my neck out for!
"After watching the political conventions, there's no reason for us to question the selection of the donkey and elephant symbols."
"I caught Junior watching the National Geographic channel, so I grounded him."
You'll strain your neck if you sit like that all day.
"I got a weird text from a ""Noah""."
"Son, get off your ass and clean up your droppings in the kitchen."
"Sweetie, the wall will be too high for us to jump over."
Why is the screen sideways?
"It's not neck to neck; trust me, she'll beat him."
We need to get that mounted.
The polls are saying it's neck and neck.
"Binge-watching ""Animal Kingdom""?"
I thought we agreed to mount the TV above the fireplace!
Housewives of the Serengeti is not an option.
"I don't know, he wants to build a wall to keep us in and have us pay for it."
"Turn it off, dear. There's no way they can deport us all."
This election
We look better in HD.
Are you watching National Conventions Wild?
"Ella, when Uncle Noah said ""Ark"", he meant ""Mediterranean cruise""! Sookie-sookie now Mama!"
I hope he builds that wall.
"Wow, honey, it's a stretch even for you to binge watch the GOP convention."
Are you all done with your grazing?
Did our leopard change his spots?
"I was proud of the Kenya connection,too."
The head room is a plus.
You're watching humans have sex again. What the hell is wrong with you. You need help.
"Honestly, the lengths some of them will go to."
"What time is ""Giraffic Park"" on ?"
What good are 189 stations and a remote without opposable thumbs?
"I'm just sayin', Trump sure has a tiny neck."
This sure beats the Serengeti Plain!
Do you think the cartoonist could have forgotten that giraffes have no voice?
The voting for Hillary thing I can see; the holding your nose thing? Not so much.
"Have you seen my good tie? You know, the long one?"
So tired of those reality shows on Animal Planet.
It just occured to me that Hell is actually other giraffes.
"""Orange is the New Black"" is not about giraffe spots, honey."
The least you could do is sit so I could enjoy your lovely legs.
Time to Netflix and neck.
Your mother in law is giraffing me crazy
The humans almost look real.
At least 'The Real Housegiraffes of New York' are getting some dinner!
He's no Marlin Perkins.
Mutual of Omaha re-runs still going on?
You are only allowed to watch Movies rated G (for Giraffe)
I think we should go with the ranch house.
You've watched this a dozen times. The lion always catches the giraffe!
I've always looked down on popular culture.
"Sire, the royal twine binders have advised me that this brand of rope has been recalled."
Sorry I am late; I got stuck in the tunnel.
"Raise the screen to eye level, our health insurance doesn't cover chiropractic treatments for stiff necks."
I vote wall mount.
How low can you go wasting your time like those humans?
Why do we have to use the back door? Why can't we go through the front lobby like everybody else?
"Why is it we never neck like we used to, whilst munching serenely the eucalyptus leaves?"
A complete waste of screen dimension.
"Hey, Babe, why the long face? .... Watching the conventions makin' you homesick for the zoo?"
The Bachelorette again? Which one is that cow necking with now?
We don't get Animal Planet.
Wonderful when the develop a TV for head shots.
"What do you mean, you want more premium channels? Why, when I was your age, all I got to watch were the endless miles of the Serengeti!!"
"I'm getting very tired of your 'Not tonight, I have a sore throat' routine!"
"No, there is nothing on the remote for ""angle of vision""."
"Yes, you're comfortable, but I'm going outside and watch the one upstairs."
I'm tired of standing like this. Why can't we get cable like everyone else?
The toilet's clogged again
"Don't be a pain in the neck, Stretch, move over!"
"I'll join you on the couch, but no necking."
First it’s the downstairs neighbors complaining about hoof beats and now the upstairs neighbors about head banging.
Animal Planet is so much better in 3D.
"You know, Janice, I stuck my neck out to get you that interview."
In the mood for necking ?
I think it should go on the wall.
The curved screen is nice but I look forward to the tall one.
I told you we should get a bigger screen TV. This one gives me neck strain.
Would you like a drink? The highballs are on me.
So much better than the savannah!
These post war ceilings are still too low.
C'mon Randy. You didn't really expect to be drafted by the Knicks.
"If the idiot installed it sideways, he should come back and do it right!"
"All right, keep watching - I'm going to find somebody to go line up with."
So why doesn't Idaho St. change their mascot and themselves to 'The Mighty Giraffes?
"Sure, the picure's great, but when are they going to come out with a 'tall screen' television."
"I worked so hard to give you a life outside of the Safari, and all you do is sit around all day watching TV."
Our rent-controlled lease has a 'no pets' clause. Could one of us be considered a pet?
I told you we should have gotten the auto-rotate feature.
"No, Emmet, you've got it sideways."
Don't get the big head over being on television.
"The kids are asleep, let's neck."
Do you think Mrs Goldman might tire of browsing acacia leaves in the punishing heat and want to swap back?
"If the volume's too high, I can turn it down for you."
Giraffes don't lie around watching TV - go outside and play Pokémon Go.
"Some Witness Protection Program, Marge... This is the last time I stick my neck out for anyone."
I told you wall mounting would be more comfortable
Is the animal channel making you homesick again?
Wall-mounted might be better.
This binge watching is cutting into our necking time!
"I don't get it, we always date naked."
"Ok, I understand ... no necking tonight."

"I told you to only watch ""G"" rated programs and feet off the couch!"
Look at those the silly elephants and donkeys.
We need our neck pillows to get through another convention.
I knew we should have gone with the leopard print fabric
Are you actually buying something on the home shopping network? ...platform shoes?
Can't we watch Animal Kingdom?
"Let me finish this, Your Highness Damocles. It's hung there for ages. What's a minute more?"
They're sending a primate to change the channel between noon and five.
Mother said no necking on the couch
I vote for neck flicks and chill
"I can't understand your fascination with 'Reality TV', it's all low hanging fruit."
"When I was young, I had to hold the tv with tinfoil on my ossicones to watch it."
"While you've been captivated by rhetoric and promises, I've been sticking my reticulated neck out all day long!"
"Don't boo, vote!"
We should check in the amazon for a higher table
"I didn't mean to, but like Hillary, I just shattered a glass ceiling."
I just don't get what's supposed to be so great with widescreen format?
What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this
"You can stay here, I'll take my chances outside."
"Stop watching 'The Kardashians"" and turn it back to The Discovery Channel."
"We're outta draft honey, all we have left is longnecks."
So glad we finally got a high definition TV!
Are you binge watching Tarzan movies again?
"Get a grip Gif, National Geo is not returning your calls, take that zoo selfie gig."
This is precisely why I said we shouldn't swap our timeshare with the Baboons.
"I'm sorry, ok. Will you please come back to bed, now?"
"No, it's *not* like there's an elephant's in the room whenever I'm around, honey."
You look like no other giraffe I've ever seen.
Have you seen 'To Catch A Predator'?
Try closing one eye.
This election is hard to swallow.
"Bob, every Sunday it's the same thing, National Geographic and Animal Planet all day!"
"You know, we're really not supposed to do this but hey, the 90's are back in fashion. Must See TV is a must see after all."
Is that calf appropriate?
Imagine how good 4K TV must look when you can see in color.
Really? The necked channel again?
I'm starting to wish some humans WERE injured in the making of this film.
'When are we getting IMAX?'
Ok. I'm sorry. Now come to bed!
"OK, I've painted the ceilings, cleaned the gutters, and pruned the trees. Do you have something less stereo-typical left for me to do?"
I don’t feel comfortable with anything wider than it is tall.
"When I was your age, son, I never would have dreamed of a giraffe president."
We need tall-screen not wide-screen
"I'll stick out my neck and say, no I don't like soaps."
I didn't fit in at the elephant or the donkey's parties'
Wanna watch a movie and neck like we used to?
Why don't we turn it off and neck a little?
"Son, get giraffe off the couch and make yourself useful!"
Another tiring day in front of the TV honey?
"You are a lazy pain in the neck, Milton."
Before this election we used to think Africa was wild.
"Obviously we'll start with some necking, but where is 2nd base?"
"Oh no, not the nature channel again!"
The Hippos are making such a mess by the pool
"Hoax or not, Noah DID own a film studio."
Don't look so dreamy eyed you know the TV adds six inches.
This sure beats Guantanamo!
"I'm sorry Beth Anne, I still don't feel at home."
Animal kingdom just doesn't seem to mean the same anymore !
"Would you have imagined that one day we would watch ""Nature"" on television?"""
I told you we should have mounted it on the wall!
Try tilting your neck.
I keep forgetting that these screens are measured diagonally.
"They don't make a ""vertical"" model!"
I wish they would bring back Marlin Perkins.
I prefer the format where everyone is tall and skinny.
"""My love, sitting is the new smoking""."
How in the world did we get in here?
I prefer portrait over landscape layout.
"Don't give me that look, Cheryl. You knew mounting it wasn't in the budget."
Do you think the Republicans know that elephants are African American?
"Now dear, didn't the chropractor suggest not twisting your legs when watching?"
I can't believe your dad is going to vote for him.
"I know you hate these reality TV shows, but I just love David Attenborough's voice."
I know . . . Tall screen would have been too much to ask.
Maybe I should run for President. This election is already a zoo.
It's beneath us.
I don't care to watch Animal Planet when I've lived it all day.
"You have been watching, ""Duck Dynasty"" for hours. You know what goes around comes around, right?"
Watching cartoons all day is not going to get you into the college you want.
"I'm going to sit this one out, rather than vote for that elephant. (Ed: ""that"" should be underlined)"
I am here to get giraffe off the couch!
"I used to look up to you and admire your lofty goals, but now you just sit around watching reruns of ""The Young and the Neckless""."
"I think we are in the lions' den, shouldn't we leave soon ?"
"You're right, it's time for us to start our own political party."
"Watching 'Noah's Ark' yet again, dear?"
Don't you wish sometimes if you could reach out inside this screen and bite his ugly orange head off ?
You never wear the turtleneck I gave you.
"After those conventions, it's time for a third party."
"You know the drill - PBS, yes -- animal planet, no........"
I think you've got the screen turned the wrong way.
"When was the last time you used your tongue to clean out your ears?...I said, 'What's for dinner?'"
Seriously? You really think you need the remote control?
Use a pillow or you'll strain you neck.
Maybe it isn't the right timing for a third party this election cycle.
Love fades. Spots are forever.
Wanna check out the red room? We could do a little necking.
I asked again. They don't make them vertical.
Why do the donkeys and elephants get to have all the fun?
Why don't you go to sleep already?
"Unfortunately, 'Orange Is The New Black' has nothing to do with Giraffes."
I don't think a wide screen is going to help us.
I see you're ready for some necking.
Wanna get neck'id and screw?
Come on. Let's go to the zoo and see grandma before it closes.
"But it's never really a choice between giraffe, donkey, or elephant."
"I'll hold hooves, but absolutely no necking..."
I've never seen you this low
The camera does add 100 pounds.
"What a day, my neck is killing me."
Don't waste your time. The signal is spotty.
We should do something about that door
It's Jungle Adventure again. They've agreed to set up a Netflix account for you at work.
"Hey, my turn to be the remote control today!"
"So--- is watching ""Animal Kingdom"" reruns really worth giving up our Serengeti patch?"
are you watching Serengeti place.
"Darling, I told you already: ""The Redneck National Convention will not address any of the daily challenges faced by middle-class people in our condition."""
That's enough tv young man... go out and stretch your legs.
You're sitting in my spot.
Don't stretch your neck watching that.
"I have told you the Discovery Channel, is just a conspiracy to keep us afraid."
If you turn it on it's side the kids heads don't get cut off.
"Well, I'm not changing."
Should have gotten a bigger screen
"I'm running out to the brush, you need anything?"
After watching the Elephants and now the Donkeys I really think we should get in the game.
How can elephants and donkeys even watch this stuff?
Nature shows? Seriously?
You're watching only because the candidates are neck and neck.
I thought the love seat was meant for us to cuddle.
"I keep on telling you,  is no such a thing as a giraffe channel!"
Why do you always have to take the giraffe's share?
Let's try turning it the other way.
"You Know, with the donkey and elephant doing so poorly this could be our year!"
Can you believe we once had opposable thumbs?
"For my birthday, I would love to have something very expensive: A wool turtle neck sweater..!"
Neck and chill?
"Bad news, sire, the chosen one's hands are too small."
hello
"You'll never succeed if you don't get your ass off that sofa, and stick your neck out!"
"Still hooked on ""Human Planet"" I see."
And no one believed in Lamarckian evolution back in the 21st Century!
The zebras are getting more coverage this year.
I'd like to watch the Bears Bengals game instead of your family on Animal Planet
I think it's high time we bu a wall-mounted screen.
Jeez. Don't you ever get tired of all these talking heads?
"Do you want to ""Neckflix and chill""?"
Want to neck?
You do know binging Breaking Bad will stunt your growth.
I don't understand your addiction to midget mud wrestling.
Just stop watching. It's beneath you.
"How about a real safari for our next vacation, darling?"
"There's nothing on, wanna neck?"
I never should have let you subscribe to the all headlights channel
I need him for president like I need a sore throat.
You really should rotate the monitor 90 degrees when you do a video chat.
would it be too much trouble for a man to have some hay in the trough when he gets home after a long day?
It's citizens like us who are putting a crack in the glass ceiling.
How about a little necking while the ads are on.
Is the race still neck and neck?
This zoo finally has some decent amenities.
You are right. Let's turn it the other way!
"It's not exactly giraffe-friendly, is it?"
You won't reach your natural potential by lolling about like that.
"I get it why the elephant in the first convention, but don't understand why the donkey in this one."
"Honey, aren't you tired of watching all those human shows?"
"Animal Planet! Have they gotten to that ""husbandry"" part yet?"
Sit up straight and stretch out your neck! You will thank me when you're an adult.
Let's bring in the children. They would enjoy this show!
Not all elephants and donkeys act like the ones you see on TV.
"This time, I think the elephants will forget."
Move over sweet thing and let's neck.
You need to play outside! I don't care if the servers of Human Go are down again.
Can we please watch something other than 'Real Housewives of the Serengeti' tonight?
"The elephant and donkey show keeping you up, darling?"
The Libertarians just asked me to be their logo.
"Edna, I wish you would stop watching those stupid miracle spot removal infomercials. I've told you 1000 times, I love you just the way you are."
The mall was a zoo today
There's a surcharge for using the baby pool but breakfast is all vegetarian.
She's right. Those 'Bernie or Bust' people are being ridiculous.
I told you not to watch Animal Planet before bed.
25 million years of evolution down the drain.
American politics. It's just a bunch of donkeys and elephants.
Do you want to get high?
"Yeah, she's the elephant and he's the jackass."
... Oops! I forgot giraffes are mute.
Does this new lamp accentuate my neck?
I thought I asked you to wash your feet .
I wonder who'll get voted off the ark next.
We need to turn the TV on its side - it's not tall enough
"No, I don't think trying house living would be a good idea"
"No, 'Deep Throat' is not a movie about giraffes."
We need High Definition
Hey Jerry- either turn the mirror vertically or add two more...
Why can't we talk?
You give really good neck.
You're hogging all the headroom.
"We HAVE to watch! When the Republicans blame it on their donkey and the Democrats blame it on their elephant, we've got to be ready!"
"""What do you mean, eye exercise"" !!"
It's so much better since you fixed the vertical hold.
lol u have GOT to be kidding me with this rn who comes up w/ these
The candidates are neck and neck and still at each other's throats? It's a jungle out there...
I'm going outside to stretch my neck before Wild Kingdom comes on.
"Dear, why are you always sitting in my spot?"
How can you watch this lowbrow crap?
I prefer Neckflix.
Animal Planer seems to have lost its edge.
I hate it when they order a half-carafe.
Nobody's spots really look like that.
I thought we were going to neck.
Order out?
I'm so much happier with this new upholstry; animal print is just so distasteful.
"Honestly, Janine, it's a jungle out there."
"""Are you still watching that tearjerker movie ""The Animal that God Forgot""?"
"Darling, have you seen my green turtleneck?"
Any woman who can break a ceiling like THAT has my vote.
We never cuddle anymore.
What would be so wrong with a 9 x 16 aspect ratio?
What is with you and landscape videos?
This is perfect drone's-eye view. Just the way I like it!
"Quick! Put on the game, I hear it's neck and neck."
I told you there really is no use for a television as a quadruped.
Please don't stoop down to their level.
Turn off the television. We need to talk about the fact that you killed someone while texting and driving.
Stand tall! Stand tall! That's all you ever say!
Let's stay home this year and visit our friends in Great Neck.
Your father and I are worried you aren't reaching up to your full potential lately.
At least we're not Muslims
I told you it should have been on the wall and mounted higher.
"Since you retired, Animal Planet just hasn't been the same."
"Your'e watching the zoo channel again, aren't you?"
We used to be wild.
Mostly I'm just wondering how we fit through that door.
Binge watching Nature on PBS again?
"My vote is no, on the ceiling fan."
Love these extra tall ceilings!
Necking......again?
It's the RNC coming live from the Cleveland Zoo.
I just don't think it's healthy to watch the Savannah Channel 24-7.
Don't knock the TV over with your tongue.
You really need to get out and stretch your legs
I still can't believe they went with the donkey
You don't find the plot a little hard to swallow?
"Whadda you say,we turn off the TV then neck up a storm ?"
I love his forelocks.
I had mixed feelings about joining the Union but the vacation days are nice.
Are you watching your favorite shows again?
It's a love story.....wanna neck?
Does my neck look fat?
You were more fun when we were in the zoo.
I did just what you said - but it's the last time I stick my neck out for you.
Spoiler alert. The lion wins.
Do you think they'll have a political party just for us?
We could try rotating the screen 90 degrees.
It no longer seems like a zoo in here now that the elephant has left.
How about we turn off the TV and neck?
It was so nice of Noah to upgrade us
Could I entice you into a little necking while we watch 'Junglerama'?
Hooves off the couch missy.
"""Tiny House Hunters"" again?"
I have a big thumb texting issue.
Hey. We are giraffes in a house.
Rotate your screen 90 degrees for the optimal viewing experience.
I hate the stereotyping on National Geographic.
I prefer tall screen.
I prefer the Portrait orientation rather than the Landscape one.
"STOP DREAMING, THEY ARE NEVER GOING TO DO A SHOW ABOUT THE HOUSEWIVES OF THE SERENGETI."
Just another tall story
Are you high?
You're watching too much TV. Do you want to go to the zoo?
We stuck our necks out for Bernie but Sarah Silverman looks better to me now.
"I'm sticking my neck out a little, but the screen in too low."
Feeling anything yet?
...we always get our heads cut off-maybe if we got selfie stick...
"You're not searching for ""Giraffe Week"" again, are you?"
Why do you keep watching elephants and donkeys?
We left the Serengeti for this?
"This is better than waiting for an open window, don't you think?"
You know it's not just your neck you're lowering .
"Americans want truth in politics? That's a tall tale or tall order. Either way, it's a stretch."
"Sweetheart, I don't think this is what the therapist meant by ""quality time""."
Boredom with marriage. I has it.
The Lions called. They want us over for dinner.
"Maybe we should've gotten the 60"","
Why are you watching Lion King again?
I told you he'd be better than Leno.
Call it what you will Gissel but the elephants don't get all the crappy roles...just us giraffes.
Are you watching another Audrey Hepburn movie?
"I trimmed the trees, dear."
"The Viagra isn’t working, all I have is a stiff neck.”"
"Hi sweetie, how about a bit of necking?"
"I hate to disappoint you dear but, like that other charismatic megafauna, you're not qualified to be President."
I'm so glad we bought prewar. I love the high ceilings.
"Deal: I won't call your PBS shows ""highbrow"" if you don't yawn every time some guy dunks one."
"As in the wild, their pride will be our downfall."
"Every channel cute puppies.What are we,warthogs?"
``Now we're hiding the remote?''
I’m a disenfranchised viewer.
Binge watching the Animal Planet?
I've heard too much TV can shorten your neck length
Mind if I turn the TV up?
"How is the race coming? Oh, it's neck and neck"
Those politicians on TV always stretch the truth...
I told you that we should have gotten a vertical TV.
Have you heard from Noah?
Don't look at me like that. I'm only chewing. You know giraffes can't talk!
It hurts my neck to look down that low.
Even a giraffe can only stand so long for the whole long convention
I told you we couldn't fit through the door.
"I agree that it resembles a baby giraffe dear, but it is in fact the Republican nomination for President"
"You've been necking with the girl next door again, haven't you?"
The cable is out again.............
Do you know anything about the neighbor’s missing tree?
Tough day at the office. My boss told me to stop 'Giraffing.'
"You were right, Fred, Instead of the flat screen we should have gotten a tall screen"
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Wasn't he that short guy who played in the NBA?
It is time you served the dinner.
I woke up with a very sore throat!
Let's watch 'Up'.
""" The high ceilings are nice, but the doorways are a pain in the neck ""."
I told you we should have gone with cathedral ceilings.
Butter on the popcorn or not?
I kind of miss Real Housewives of the Serengeti.
"It makes me sad, too. No actors on TV look like us."
I liked it better before they banned zoos.
"Sarah, it is pronounced ""Netflix and Chill"" not ""Neck-flix and Chill""."
The Carnivores in Apartment 3 have invited us to dinner.
Just eliminate food channels recipes calling for low-hanging fruit.
I could binge watch these crazy Zebras all night.
"Ergonomically speaking, the top of the TV screen should be at eye level."
the host's name is Sarah Getty?
Are you serious? Did you just ask me what endangered meant?
I really do not think they are stretching the truth!
R.N.C.? I thought this was Animal Planet!
Watching movies at home is so much easier.
"When you said you wanted a longneck, did you mean me and or a bottle of beer?"
"Next time that big fool friend of his breaks down my door, I call the taxidermist."
"Well, he hasn't said anything about Africans . . . yet."
I realize we're a species of ruminant that stays close to its home range but come on!
The safari camps were booked.
"Oh, let's do some necking while David Attenborough is on ."
"Yes, yes, the proportions are wrong, but what about the content?"
"See, Trump’s wife is gorgeous, but her high heels are not high enough."
All of this National Geographic is not helping your FOMO.
"It's our epoch sequel, 'Giraffic Park'."
"You know, there was a time when all we would do on that couch was neck."
Would you please turn the channel.
OK! Only if you promise not to tell your parents.

"I said wall-mount, not Walmart."
"Damn, I miss phone books."
"I know it's been a ""Long Hot Summer"" outside but you don't have to watch the reruns inside."
We’ve always looked down on television.
I never knew how much I'd miss President Dumbo.
"If you don't move over, off goes Animal Planet!"
"We live in Savannah, not the Savannah."
"At least at the zoo, we didn't have to watch reruns."
Even PBS Nature programs are never completely accurate.
Elephants! donkeys! Enough with identity politics!
Are you tempted to be the new party's mascot?
I'm glad we were firm about the vaulted ceilings.
"They may be asses, but they sure can produce a political convention."
"I know, I know, your chiropractor recommends a wall-mounted television."
Get giraffe off the sofa!
"If we start necking, don't worry...I know a good chiropractor."
I hate how all the news sound bites are getting so short.
It's not how big the screen. It's where you sit.
Can you reach something for me?
Better get your feet off the sofa. The rental rules are pretty picky.
"So this time I asked him ""how's the weather DOWN there?"" and that seemed to shut him up."
"It just seems like my life is filled with low ceilings, Sylvia."
"The boys are coming over to watch the game soooo, if you could tidy up a bit. There's beers in the fridge."
Change the screen to the portrait mode!
"I know the election is frustrating, but you have to stop spitting on on the screen."
"Room’s too small, no tree leaves from Room Service, can’t access the bathroom- was seeing Lion King worth it?"
I heard when the wall is built they'll need onlookers.
"That was easy, compared to the glass ceiling."
"Tamed or not, you need to get out."
"Yes, I miss Africa, but not enough to give up air conditioning."
"And how do you propose I ""pick up the remote?"""
"Just a heads-up, the couch potato look doesn't sit well with me!"
I thought you said you were coming to bed.

"Its the food channel, they wanted me to be on it."
"I have to admit, I miss the Bronx."
"If by ""and chill,"" you mean actually watching Netflix, then yes."
"I know it's not the Serengeti, but it beats being in a cage."
"Yes, I did block Nat Geo."
I caught our daughter necking.
You need to stop comparing yourself to Oprah.
"Adjusting the ""vertical"" still doesn't get them all in the screen"
How many times have I told you to keep your neck off the furniture!
The RNC and DNC were sold to GNC.
Say what you will about their fundamentals. I'd rather watch humans play.
"Actually, I prefer a vertical format."
"'I'll watch with you once someone else gets more recognition."""
The way those wildlife shows portray us leaves me speechless.
The vertically challenged win again.
Neck flicks and chill?
Letterbox format just doesn't do it for me.
"Necking on the couch, again?"
"He said he was a grazer, but in reality he just puts his name on trees."
Stop your moping. Just be glad you're not a donkey or an elephant.
"...yes, that David Attenborough is a hunk...."
I can't believe I stuck my neck out for that lion at work.
Without better resolution there's no way to tell our nieces and nephews apart.
Tree foliage special on?
I've heard he wears stilts to appear taller.
Seriously... a wall?
"If we can't talk, how come we get captions."
Again with the hoofs on the upholstery!
The kids are finally asleep. Are you up for a little necking?
This may be our chance. They don't like either the elephant or the donkey.
The toilet is out of water again...
Be glad you stayed home sick. Work was a real zoo today.
Trump cannot deport us; we are an endangered species.
It's time we take over the donkey and elephant.
"Yes, Bob, you were spots-on again"
This is a nice waiting room. Awefully nice for that dentist to offer us complimentary cleanings.
"Damn, I hate these wide screen TVs"
Do you want acacia leaves just on your half?
Did we ever receive residuals from this National Geographic program?
Is the game still a neck and neck tie?
"Before we got HBO, the couch was used for necking"
It's a jungle out there. But it's not as bad as Trump says.
Not that nature channel again?
We really need to install a taller door.
that animal reality show is kind of distrurbing
"Yes , you cannot watch TV without being somewhat condescending ..."
"In spite of the Witness Protection Program, I think Moses has caught up with us."
Try sleeping siting up.
"For our point-of-view, let's tilt the panel onto its side."
It's a zoo out there.
I still don't get why it's an insult to call a candidate orange.
"I with the donkeys this year, honey."
Remember when Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom was the only corporate sponsor you had ever heard?
"Hey, that's my spot!!"
"If you keep sittting there, your neck will shrink."
"For the thousandth time, I agree it would have served us better if they'd oriented it the other way, but there's not much we can do about it now, is there?"
I would have been home earlier --I got stuck in the tunnel.
Mind if I switch to National Geogiraffic?
"Jeffrey, you have all those nice toys. Why are you always watching TV?"
Are you sure this is what our therapist meant when she said we should try a different environment?
Be honest - does this room make my neck look too long?
You were right. I should have gotten the car with the sunroof.
Noah assured me the lions are in a separate annex.
Convergent evolution is still a bit of a stretch.
A first-class upgrade. . . good old Noah.
Has 'Lion Week' started yet?
Are you watching Human Planet again?
What elephant?
Sophie's Choice isn't the French children's film you were expecting?
Thank God for pre war ceilings
"You really have to learn to relax, honey,--or maybe cook!"
They always cut our heads off!
Housewives of the Serengeti? Puleeze!
"This is not my idea of a ""high-rise"" apartment!"
The neighbors complain that we act above it all
"Honey, wanna neck?"
What do you mean you can't reach the remote?
Sure beats eating the top one percent.
"With all this diversity on TV now, I think we can stop pretending we're sisters."
I fail to see the connection between hogging the sofa and couples' therapy.
You can't look down on this series
Sit up straight or you'll hurt your neck.
"A third party would probably use a unicorn or a leprechaun for its mascot - not a giraffe, because they actually exist."
"Don't worry, the technician is coming back to turn the screen like it should be."
"Harold, Tuesday is your day to be the antenna."
We should get a taller screen.
We should've ordered Higher-def.
"Really, the Animal Planet again? Obviously, we need to get back to counseling."
"It's a love story, Honey. Come sit, let's neck awhile."
Talk about sticking your neck out!
Hurry up or we'll miss the Ark.
"I've been watching all day, and I think we're under-represented."
"I know you're not supposed to be on your feet too much, but the entire 14 months?!"
Go fetch your own longneck!
"Hey, sailor, want to neck?"
You heard what the president said.... Democracy isn't a spectator sport! It's time to get out of the house and do some door-to-door campaigning.
House Hunters? Again? We’re not moving.
It would be nice if the screen was up higher!
No we don't need to order the Little Giant Ladder.
Don't sit so close.
"You know Ellie, this TV is becoming a real pain in the neck."
Watching okapi bowling again?
At last the baby's finally asleep with his cute little stuffed Donald.
We ordered a portrait TV and they sent us landscape!
It's not exactly the aspect ratio we were looking for.
Watching yourself on Nature again?
"Why not? There's a lot of money in an ear, nose and throat practice."
When are you coming to bed?
A little necking before we go into the other room?
"I've read the review, it's a steamy romance movie set in the Serengeti. Pretty much the usual thing, boy meets girl, they hold hands, fall in love... Twist is they've cast a couple of hippo's in the lead roles, think I'll get an early night, enjoy!!"
"I can't believe we found such high ceilings, who is this Trump Towers?"
At least we can look over his stupid wall.
"If you want to stick your neck out, then tell them to vote their conscience."
"The kids aren't asleep, so please kill the sound when African Safari comes on."
Can we switch from Animal Planet to ESPN now?
"Ted, get giraffe off the couch and help with the chores."
I thought we decided that vertical worked better than wide screen.
We really need to get a wall mount.
When are they going to start making tall screen tvs?
They were all out of tall-screen TVs.
"You'll only get spotty coverage on that channel, you know."
Who is that orangutan and what is he doing to the elephants?!
Are you seriously watching 'The Real Housewives of The Serengeti' again?
"Well, we could neck."
Seriously? Again with the tall screen vs wide screen?
Nothing in this country comes in our size.
Even with our legendary peristalsis I'm having trouble trying to swallow either of these presidential candidates.
Now I suppose he's going to ban all mammalians coming out of Africa.
This is the last time I am going to stick my neck out for you Kevin.
Why do they keep making such a fuss about HER? You didn't have any trouble shattering the glass ceiling!
"King of the jungle isn't looking so bad now, is it?"
"Want to watch the antelopes rut on Animal Planet, or should we just go neck?"
"No, dear, what we ordered was Netflix, not Neckfix."
Did you see the shower?
I told you not to start Game of Thrones without me.
The wide screen just doesn't work for me.
"Listen Junior, I am not sticking my neck out to get you an audition on Animal Planet"
"If I've asked you once, I've asked you a thousand times - don't put your feet up on the couch!"
"I want more than Netflix and necking Lois, I wanna be wild."
"I don't think we should make-out tonight, I have a sore throat."
I'm so glad they chose donkeys and elephants.
"Haven't you had enough of those ""Real Housewives of the Serengeti""?"
"It's not even plugged in, so what are you staring at!?"
"Oh, yea, I am team Cookie and Lucious all the waaay!"
"If the Discovery Channel makes you homesick, stop watching."
I said I'd get a good giraffe watching the conventions and I wasn't kidding!
Won it in a giraffle.
"I know we're huge, but I am with Her."
"Well, it's official, the Livingstons have a sunroof on their new Range Rover."
DEEP THROAT's on tonight.
I still think we should have mounted it on the wall!
"I know it isn't hay, but the Knicks just offered me $15 million a year to play power forward."
Can't you scoot over? You're in my spot!
What's happened to us Marge.. we used to be so wild?
"Let's rotate the screen and watch Animal Planet, our people are on."
You have to look at me to lip read.
Again watching Animal Planeck ?
"I hear that the GOP elephant is retiring, but I wouldn't want that job."
"Please tell me you didn't order another multi-purpose, 14-foot ladder."
"No dear, it's not entitled 'Giraffic Park'."
Stop fooling around—put the TV back on its side.
I told you we should have hung the TV over the fireplace
Did you eat all the leftover leaves?
Television always makes everyone look shorter.
"You know, if you watch TV all day your neck will stay that way."
"The silent treatment, again?!"
I still say the screen should be at eye level.
So much for appealing to our demographic!
"Not tonight honey, I'm watching a show about an endangered species of human."
"Oh, I've got this! What is ""Born Free?"""
Torrential downpour in the forecast. Hurry up and pack so we don't get left behind. You know how impatient Noah can be sometimes.
Next sublet we get a longer couch.
The TV shows today are too bland. Nobody wants to stick their necks out anymore.
"Oh, Let them eat cake!"
They say the camera adds 3 feet to the neck.
Must be Human Week?
Can't we just neck tonight?
Don't you Remember? That's the episode where he eats shoots and leaves.
Don't worry Donald Trump Jr. only hunts Big Cats
Clarissa stop watching Trump!His Son shot one of us back in The Old Country
"I told you to order a tall screen TV, not a wide screen TV."
"It's just a bunch of tall stories, I'm for Hillary"
There is talk of building a wall that even we won't be able to see over. There is talk of building a wall that even we won't be able to see over.
"His father's from Kenya, you know?"
The Conventions are over. It’s now safe to go outside.
Hi honey. Work was a total zoo again.
I knew we should have opted for the wall-mounted model.
"""Table top is fine,"" you said, ""who needs a wall mount?"" Sometimes you're such a pain in the neck!"
I wish we had a top-to-bottom screen instead of this side-to-side.
"I hear bipeds are using our term ""helicopter parents."""
Are you going to eat the leaves out of the gutter like I asked.
Would you like to go to the zoo and see the humans today?
"Harold, we need to talk about the elephant in the room"
They don't make tall screens.
If Trump wins we're moving back to Africa.
The game's on...want me to bring you a longneck?
How many times have I told you not to sit on the couch?
Satisfied? I told you that couch would be too small for necking.
Why don't you get giraffe off the couch and do some chores?
No thanks. The Discovery Channel gives me nightmares.
"If you want mimosa buds for dessert, you can darn well pluck them yourself."
You know your neck shrinks when you're depressed.
"Since they've started blocking VPNs, we only get Netflix Serengeti."
"I don't think ""Necrophilia"" means what you think it means."
too much guerilla warfare ~ let's watch So You Think You Can Migrate
"You know that couch isn't good for your neck, right?"
"""Real Housewives""? I know you like low-hanging fruit, but come on."
Your turn to adjust the antenna.
Lets go out to the Savanna.
There’s no place to put the elephant in this room
Times up. I get the TV control and sofa now.
"Jimmy's in bed, let's watch Wild Kingdom."
I nailed that “hump day” audition; then they go and give the commercial to some camel.
"When I was your age, I was roaming the savanna."
I wonder how our housing exchange partners are doing in the Savannahs.
What's on Neck Flicks?
The surround sound is a lot better without the ceiling fan.
You're still binge watching 'Zoo?'
Move over a bit so we can neck while watching tv.
"Looks like those ""elephants"" are bent on extinction."
How are you liking your subscription to Neckflix?
Enough TV let's go outside and neck wrestle
"Write down that number for a neck massage."""
Can you adjust the vertical?
What's for dinner?
Fox News is too much of a stretch for me.
You are going to have a crick in your neck if you keep watching the RNC convention.
"Sure I'd like to neck, but there isn't enough room on the sofa."
Why widescreen when a tall-screen is more appropriate?
They don't even make an adaptive remote.
We should have ordered the ceiling mount.
"I wasn't impressed with the ark on the outside, but this is nice."
The reviewers gave this one high marks for off-axis viewing.
They call THAT high-definition?
I don't even know why you watch it. Every week he gives the rose to the one with the longest neck.
Noah's outside waiting in the Ark when you're ready.
Aren't you outraged that all TV screens are horizontally over- represented?
Let's start first with my viagra-filled acacia leaf quiche; then follow that with a nice tall frosty acacia leaf beer to loosen up all those damn neck vertebrates--and then we can go crazy. OK?
Is That High Enough?
Makes me thankful I was born a giraffe.
Now aren't you glad they chose elephants and donkeys instead of US??
Do they realise we're always dating naked?
"Hey Long Tall Sally, enough Animal Planet. I know it's a jungle out there, but go outside and play."
Didn't I tell you that the HGTV Dream Home would be better than the zoo.
"what do you think he meant by ""no necking"" ?"
I think the manager is on to us. He asked me if I've ever heard of Wild Kingdom.
"Okay! It is my turn to see all evil, hear all evil, and not speak about the evil."
It's over your head.
"You are wasting your life watching TV, you are so smart, head and shoulders above your class."
I still say you're too tall for Project Runway.
You'll have to face it sooner or later. You're a portrait guy in a landscape world.
"It's ""Poacher Week"" already?"
We can't be photographed at the party in the same outfit!
"I love and support you, but I am struggling to adjust to this whole naturism thing..."
Marlin Perkins reruns?
The new TV will make it a lot easier to swallow this election year overload.
"I wanted something with depth, but I all I see are overviews."
Feel like necking?
Watching Neckflix again?
"They're neck and neck? Yeah, right."
The remote? What's that?
You'll only see Donkeys and Elephants.
We should have put on the wall.
"""I wish they'd make these TVs vertical""."
Can you move over a bit?
Is the zoo letting you work from home?
"Ummm, Gi I was thinking, let's go to a dermatologist and see if he could treat us with some dark spot remover... Raffe it's heredity."
"No, they still haven't invented a tall-screen TV."
You lost the remote again?
"You’re always perfectly satisfied with the status quo of everything—the height of our doorways and ceiling, the size of our TV and sofas—and you’re never even willing to make an effort to understand—never mind share—my desire to update our lifestyle."
I don't suppose you feel like necking.
You're staying home for a little sore throat?
Would you like a long-neck bottle of beer?
"How many times hav I told you, take your feet off the couch!!"
The trees aren't going to trim themselves.
You know watching Wild Kingdom before bed gives you bad dreams.
You admire them?!? How did it get so twisted?
"Yes, for a sore throat you have to take all thirty."
I didn't know Noah's ark would be so luxurious.
Politicians can't outrun lions on Realty TV
Political conventions are a different wild kingdom altogether.
High definition has nothing to do with your neck
"Honey your favourite show is on, ""The Kamalsutra""."
You can watch 'Animal Planet.' I'm going to watch 'Zoo' on my computer.
I can't believe you're watching that Zebra channel again.
These jungle soaps would be more exciting if they added some necking.
"Don't worry, one day we'll be right up there with the Lions, Bears, and Broncos."
"No, you can't order it. We don't live in an area serviced by Amazon."
I’d like to see her try to break through a pre-war plaster ceiling.
May I join you?
Honey ... I know you think DIY is self-help and IT IS! But it means YOU do it yourself not THEY do it and you watch!
"Who says there's no progress? After 240 years, an orangutan has been nominated for the presidency."
"She broke the glass ceiling? So what, I did that last week."
"At least the elephant won't be able to tell the ""sticking your neck out too far"" joke ever again."
Ringling Brothers is on the phone for you. Again.
Don't look down on their Soap operas.
"These new, humane zoos are great, but I wish there were more cable options."
Sorry I'm late. I hit every traffic light coming home.
Move the television to vertical then if the heads are being cut off.
"How quaint, the elephants are called Republicans, and donkeys are called Democrats."
This is what happens when we let the humans go outside to play Pokemon-Go.
You are really sticking your neck out trying to watch the political conventions on TV.
Hey Honey. It has been a long day at work. What kind of leaves are we having for dinner tonight?
I can't believe our Tommy has graduated from high school.
Isn't that TV a little low?
Don't tell me to zip it!
What did Bernie say?
"Can you turn it up, please?"
Want to do some necking while watching TV ?
"let's eat out tonight, honey. How about Central Park?"
I keep telling you that the screen has to be higher so I won't get a sore neck!
"Wild Kingdom comes on in ten minutes dear, how 'bout a nice big bowl of acacia chips and dip to go with it?"
Do you want to tell me why my fern is bare?
"Young man, the lawn isn't going to eat itself."
We didn't come on this safari so you could watch Necksflix
Do you want to neck?
Neither one has much of a neck.
In giraffe years you're a Millennial---so I'm kicking you out.
"You know dear, I thought all that money from the settlement would make us happy, but honestly, I now find you to be distant and aloof."
I still miss Marlin Perkins.
How the hell do you get out of here anyway?
That's a tall order
Get gir-affe off the couch.
The down side of being raised in captivity is that it's your turn to take out the garbage.
Still think we don't need to wall mount it?
It's not us. Cable is out in the whole neighborhood.
"If you wanted an open floor plan, then why the hell did we leave the savannah?"
'You left the seat up again'
Watching these travel shows makes me want to go to Africa someday.
Don't worry. One day you'll grow enough to graduate from being a grass muncher to a leaf aficionado just like me.
Really..I can't believe you're still watching the real house giraffes of the Serengeti?!
I don't know why you watch this 'Human Planet' garbage.
"Be careful, watching too much TV will give you a stiff neck."
"Don't you think we should invest in a vertical screen, so our heads don't get cut off?"
"You're watching ""Out of Africa"" again?"
You call that Serengeti show reality TV? The only talking giraffes are in the Toys R Us commercials!
What is it about the Kardashians that fascinates you?
Don't tell me you're afraid of heights.
I wish my contacts weren't bifocals.
Is the elephant not here yet?
This low-brow fare is beneath you.
I thought HiDef was about dimensions.
Nothing's on TV. Wanna neck?
"Noah called, the cruise leaves at 10."
I love a condo with high ceilings!
You said you wouldn't watch Planet Earth without me.
"So, acacia leaves for dinner again?"
The Nature Channel is calling. They want to do a show on 'At Home With Giraffes.'
I need more space.
Are you going to hog the clicker too?
Did you know they have the same number of vertebrae as we do?
"Dear, what time did you say they're coming to balance the A/C system?"
"If he wins, we're going back to Africa, honey."
"Did the children take a trip to the zoo, or in the zoo?"
If you ask me these wildlife shows are all scripted.
"Jerome, you've been watching way too much Neckflix."
Would you like to neck-flex and chill?
Can't we watch something besides donkeys and elephants for a change?
"I warned you dear about New York ""Airbnb"" rentals."
"If it had been like this, I never would have left the ark."
I'm afraid 'Orange Is the New Black' wasn't what I expected.
This is ridiculous! Why can't we get a wall mount?
I'm thinking wall mount and a lot higher!
We should have got the one with the height adjustment
"Well, I won't feel any safer."
Be realistic. You wouldn't really move to Africa if Trump wins.
"Oy, Real Giraffes from the Serengeti?"
How did we ever get around before AirBnB?
Wanna get high?
"You can watch TV with your boyfriend, but no necking."
"You've got to get that TV mounted higher, honey--your chiropractor bills are adding up."
Let's move the TV to over the fireplace.
We could run this convention so much better than the elephants.
"If he wins, we're moving back to Africa."
Do you really think they will deport us?
Barbra you are slim! The screen is just not designed to flatter OUR body type.
Watching those NBA pipsqueaks again?
Enough TV. How about we just stretch out together?
"If I hear Al Roger say, ""Here's the weather in your neck of the woods, "" one more time ..."
"It's not the size of the screen, it just needs to be up higher."
"Perhaps an awkward question, but might you be interested in a little necking?"
Hillary or Trump
"Oh honey, you must stop comparing your neck length to the younger ones you see on the National Geographic channel. This bull of your tower only has eyes for you."
Election coverage? We put the circus behind us.
"Don't worry, Geoffrey, you'll work again. How long could this internet fad last?"
Those politicians only go after the low-hanging fruit.
Is it Human week yet?
I keep telling you there is no giraffe news.
"It's a real ""Wild Kingdom"" in here with you."
Watching one of your tall tales again?
"Argh, what did the elephants say now?"
"Lighten up. I said acacia, not euthanasia."
"Believe me, I am not cheating on you."
I see you've moved the screen on its side AGAIN
"Even if I could reach the remote you dropped under the sofa, how could I change from the Weather Channel?"
You didn't tell me they were measured diagonally.
I hope you appreciate that I stuck my neck out for the big screen!
Love the cathedral ceilings.
"No, dear. A vertical kickstand won't solve the problem."
Don't ask me. I've never used the remote in my life.
"When you ignore me, you make me feel like I'm eight feet tall."
They have the same number of vertebrae but that's as far as it goes.
For some reason I always look fat in those home videos.
Noah said he will give us a discount if we pay up front for the 40 nights.
I hate it when they pander to the zoological vote.
I will meet you in 10 minutes at the watering hole downstairs.
So good to be home. It's a real jungle out there.
I find a Trump presidency hard to swallow also.
I'm going to stick my neck out.
I did not. I called you a pain in the rear.
I don't understand how people voted for such an animal.
"If seeing predators catching prey upsets you so much, turn the damn thing off."
Come on let us change the sports Chanel and watch trump giving news conference .At least it will give us some adrelanin raise??
Aren't you glad we're not the logo for either party?
Do I have to duck?
Don't you get tired of watching animal shows?
Really gives you something to ruminate about.
"Finally, an appeal for the Animal vote."
"Want to watch ""Necked and afraid""?"
It's been elephants and donkeys on TV for the past two weeks.
I'm not watching Madagascar again.
Screw you Earl. What does that gorilla have that I don't?
You can't look away? Then just stand up and be above it all!
They dropped the National Geographic Channel.
Perhaps it's time for the elephant and donkey to step aside.
Tell me your not watching another silent film?
"If you like, I can hang the TV higher."
If he gets elected its Hello Serengeti!
Sorry for sticking my neck in..........
"Election coverage again, honey? I've had enough of this baboon."
"This new 4k TV makes ""Out of Africa"" look like a Soap Opera."
I haven't really enjoyed TV since those darned wide screens came in.
"Hey, hon, the Libertarians are auditioning for a mascot."
Two million years of evolution so that you can change the station with your nose instead of using the remote?
You were supposed to install it vertically!!
"At the risk of sticking my neck out, may I change the channel?"
The serengeti isn't going to be here forever.
I didn't mind when the zebras moved into our neighborhood. But what's going to happen to our property values now that the lions have moved in?
"you know those Planet Earth videos are completely scripted, right?"
I may be sticking my neck out— did you hide the remote?
You got a wide screen TV. I asked for a tall screen TV.
"""There's an elephant in the room""."
"Stop staring. It's a political convention, not a car crash."
"No son, I won't leave your father for Richard Attenborough."
An exciting race at the Olympics. At the finish line they were neck and neck.
Let's hope FIOS doesn't follow through with those break-neck speeds
"I'm sorry , thats the only channel, the remote fell under the couch."
"If it really takes two to tango, you are well equipped to dance by yourself. I'm watching my shows."
I am feeling a little horny. Do you wanna neck?
That's my spot.
"Whatching TV shows all day long, at least you need to stretch you neck or something."
You can't expect anything but donkeys and elephants for a while.
"After ""Keeping up with"", how about some ""Animal Planet""?"
"Well, I lost another audition to that damn Geoffrey today"
"Well, I think it should be on the wall, closer to the ceiling."
No more long Neckflix binges for you.
Are you seeing what Iam seeing
Didn't we already watch this episode of Next Top Leaf?
Next time can we house sit for taller people?
You're a maculate housekeeper.
"You're not watching those infomercials on spot removers again, are you?"
You've watched this episode of Giraffe Man five times! Go outside and play!
"""No necking on the love seat!!"
Nova's 'Nature vs Nurture' again?
I think it's time to upgrade to the tall screen television.
Widescreen doesn't do a thing for me.
"They’re bringing back The Wire, and it’s set in the Serengeti!"
I needed some alone time away from Pokemon Go.
Still think we should have gone with the wall mount.
Oh my aching neck! You really should of had the TV wall mounted.
I think she stretched the truth.
I know. Let's watch Neckflix.
Animal Planet reruns? Again?
"Chill, babycakes. We'll stay here four years if the elephants win."
I love PBS programming. It's so... Highbrow.
I see you've been binge watching Neckflix again.
"Next time we stage a takeover, let's find a species with more comfortable housing."
I told you we should have mounted it higher on the wall.
Madagascar again?
Didn't she tell you a hundred times to keep your feet off the sofa!
So where's the elephant in the room?
Your obsession with Shark Week makes no sense.
Your tete-a-tête-à-tête will not accommodate a cou-a-cou.
"Look Geoffrey... Amazon isn't going anywhere. It's all retail, not just toys. Now stop watching Netflix and get out there and find a new job."
The fewer glass ceilings the better.
What's this about an elephant in the room?
You really think we need the remote?
So glad I'm not an elephant or a donkey.
Will we ever agree on what is eye-level?
Elephants and donkeys! Elephants and donkeys! How discouraging!!
"Honey, you need a job. This penthouse is quite a stretch for us."
Did you leave the remote control back in the desert?
I told you we would love the upgrade to the suite on Noah's ark. Pass the remote.
Kardashians of the Serengeti again?
You have children to feed. I think JoJo can find her soulmate without you.
I still think one of the parties should be a giraffe.
"Horizontal, horizontal, horizontal! Why are they all horizontal?"
"The doctor said get rest, drink lots of tea, and that sore throat will be gone in a year."
Was that cousin Bob you saw on Growing Up Giraffe this morning?
We need to discuss the elephant in the room.
"Bro, I got cut from the swim team."
Why do you watch those wildlife shows when you have the real thing right here?
"Don't worry. I just scored passes for us on the Ark, if Trump wins."
We used to use that couch for necking . . .
I think the zebra costumes are a better fit.
Sorry Hon ... We're all out of Bud Longneck.
I just discovered these horns are for wifi
"The convertible seems more practical, don't you think?"
You always think the Lion's the killer
I still say it's turned the wrong way.
"Honey, are you watching that trashy Animal Planet show again?"
I suppose you ate all the bonbons too.
Just because you can see the top of the hoop doesn't mean your short legs can score.
It's a jungle out there on the news channel.
"Binge watching ""Wild Kingdom"" never gets old."
I told you we should have mounted the TV over the fireplace.
Can I pour you a tall drink?
The cat tasted sour. How long where you sitting on him for?
Aren't you glad we finally talked about the elephant in the living room?
Ok- it's a tough job market. But there still has to be a demand for the only song and dance team like us.
"Don't worry, she'll win."
I don't care if it is connected to your smartphone. This is the last time I'm squezzing through that door!
"When they go low, we go high."
I'm going out. I left you some dinner on top of the fridge.
"Oh. I thought you said, ""NECK, flicks and chill"". My bad."
What if we stood it on its side?
All this NBA talk has gone straight to your head.
But WHY do we need a washing machine?
"So, Trump says he wants to send us all back to Africa... but I was born at the Bronx Zoo!"
It's time to dump the elephant.
Next time let's get a longscreen TV.
You're so obsessed with people shows.
"Wild Kingdom is hardly what I'd call ""Reality"" TV."
You're always hogging the couch!
Don't worry about the lost remote. Millions of years of evolution have enabled you to change channels with your tongue.
"When the Zebras are here, just black and white."
I've seen this one; the lions eat the wildebeest.
"You're really supposed to have that thing at eye level, you know."
Watching the Nature Channel is not helping your depression.
We sure we're lucky to find a condo with 12 foot ceilings!
You always grab the best seat and I have to crane my neck!
They swap homes with us and then have the nerve to complain about the lions.
"I know the tastiest leaves are always just out of reach, but trust me on this ... Viagra won't help."
"Lion porn, again?"
Let's see what the candidates are up to on People Planet.
Scooch over. I'm in a mood for some serious necking.
Did I mention to you that you have to flip it up to get the portrait mode?
"Honey, you've got the screen sideways."
"You know, the TV should really be at eye level."
Watching Animal Kingdom again? Get your sweet long neck out of here and clean your bathroom!
Are you sitting on the remote?
Why did you put the TV on its side?
Should we hang it up above the mantel?
Another kite in a tree 'emergency'....
NO DINNER? Don't the Kardashians show recipes?
"House sitting has been fun, but I'm ready to get back to my own patch of grass."
At least we're vegan.
"I thought you had your fill of ""neck and neck races."""
"David Attenborough, AGAIN ?!?"
I told you it would be sexier if you showed more of your legs.
I'm thinking about starting a new political party.
Did you eat all the Acacia ice cream?
Perhaps a model with a vertical orientation would work better for us.
Another infomercial on neck reduction surgery?
"Hang it up, even QVC has no turtlenecks in your size."
"Sure, the big-screen t.v. in this sublet's good, but I REALLY like the high ceilings!"
Are high collars back in?
"If we mounted it on the wall, we wouldn't have to stare down at the screen."
Neckflix tonight?
"I'm meeting the boys again, honey, but this time we promise not to chew on the cable."
Watching Wild Kingdom again Ethel? Aren't you tired of seeing Trump?
Let’s watch the Discovery channel show about the vanishing tribes of Africa. I heard is both fascinating and tragic.
Didn't I tell you not to watch Lion Week
"Remember when we were young, broke, with the run of the Savanna?"
I still think we should have bought the tallscreen model instead.
Neckflix and chill tonight?
Aren't you tired of watching your close escape from the Lion King?
Let's neck instead!
I told you Jon Snow wasn't really dead.
I had no idea staterooms on this ark would be so plush.
"darling even if the box doesn't mention it, I am sure there is no rule against turning it the other way.."
We probably should have hung it on the wall.
Don't fall asleep on the couch again. Your neck will hurt
Thank god they chose an elephant. That could have been us on there.
Why didn't you come home last night?
Not another sore throat!
Are you up for some necking tonight?
Did the cheetah get kicked off the island yet?
Isn't that turned sideways?
Tell PETA to get better programming--or I am headed back to the zoo!
Get your own beer.
"Yes, Wes Anderson does do interesting things with head room."
All I could find was horizontal format. There's no sensitivity to diversity in the population.
We need to talk.
Are we watching the Elephants or the Donkeys tonight ?
Are you ready to start thinking about how we get out of here?
"You want a beer, I'll get you a beer. Stubby or longneck?"
"I'm just saying, we haven't urinated on each other since your mother moved in."
You look too comfortable. How about we switch spots for a while?
What do you need the remote control for anyway?
"Cheer up Gerald, at least we're not elephants."
I love Safari!
Video yoga lessons are ruining your posture!
The top of the fridge is dusty.
Mom Jamie isn't sharing!
