Well, that explains our relentless hunt for tuna.
Call him Ishmeow.
The Canary Islands? Who told him we should go there?
Am I the only one who misses the parrot?
Well what do you think happened to the parrot?
That's Ahab's brother, Rehab. He's in pet therapy.
Apparently the cat cost him an arm and a leg.
He calls it Ishmeow
I killed 20 mice this morning but does he rub my belly?
But I thought Persians weren't allowed in under the travel ban...
Aye! He's not the same old Ahab since that anger management class.
Oh sure, he likes the cat now but in two weeks I guarantee you I'm the one taking care of it.
It's agreed then, we'll tell people the captain was obsessed with a great white whale.
I swear I've thrown the same cat overboard 8 times already.
Since when do we have a pension plan?
Funny.. I always thought he was a whale person.
I guess it's a match made in heaven. He get's a companion, the cat gets a scratching post.
He is rich and famous, he can grab one whenever he wants
This service animal thing is getting way out of hand.
Strangely, it's the hat that bothers me the most.
Ruins strikin' terror into prisoners' hearts, don't he?
We'll see how affectionate he is when he finds out who ate his parrot.
She's just using him for his scratching post.
So it will be fiction. Tell Herman to make it a whale.
Since Ahab had him neutered, we call him Moby Dickless
I'll tell you exactly what happened to that parrot.
For a guy hunting Dick all his life, he really took to stroking Pussy.
Not likely this'll be in the book.
He thinks he can grab a pussy anytime he wants.
I didn't think that type was into heavy petting.
He keeps asking where the catwalk is located.
Do you want to tell him we can't find the parrot, or should I?
An' he keeps the litter box on the poop deck.
There goes my novel.
Funny, I always pegged him as a whale person.
Of course the guy with the scratching post for a leg gets all of the attention.
Well, it got him off the white whale kick.
The whale represents the unrelenting fury of nature. The cat is just a cat.
It's an emotional support animal, I saw the paperwork.
The captain says we should head to the Canary Islands.
I'm suggesting a mewtiny.
Not only was I demoted to second mate, but I have to clean the first mate's litter box.
The whale obsession is bad enough, but if he turns into a crazy cat person I'm jumping ship.
Would it kill him to put on an eyepatch and buy a parrot?
Well he would play with me too if I had a scratching post for a limb.
Like I always say, you're either a cat person or a great white whale person.
I say we still go ahead with the mutiny.
He calls it Moby Lick.
Doesn't he ever wonder what ate his parrot?
Look, all I'm saying is that I think a hook is more intimidating.
It keeps his mind off whales
This is going to wreck our brand.
I don't think the new guy gets the whole 'bloodthirsty' thing.
Teaching Polly to say "Here kitty" was a terrible idea.
Suppose I accidentally throw a ball of string on the plank?
...so it turned out he was just looking for a pet.
At least I don't need to sit on his lap anymore.
When yer ship less, yer shiftless... cat's dead!
I'm worried about our 'take-no-prisoners' image.
You know, I haven't seen Polly lately either.
Where's the allegory in that?
It's easy to be the cat's favorite when you have a scratching post for a leg
Which one of us is going to tell him he's ruining our reputation?
I always thought of him as more of a whale person.
"Moby Cat"? I don't know, Herm....maybe a short story, at most.
I don't care what the captain says, I won't shout out, "Thar she purrs!"
Quite frankly I feel like he's lost his edge.
Call me Ishmeow'el.
Should we make him walk the plank or clean the litter box?
Worst prequel ever.
We both know what happened to Petey. Parrots don't just fly away.
I'll mutiny before I call him 'cat'n.'
If you do turn this into a novel, Herman, you might want to change a few details.
I prefer sea dogs.
We get more "likes" when he's holding the cat.
He keeps saying 'Arr kitty' but so far it's just his!
Great, this is gonna ruin our cold-blooded image.
He has a built in scratching post.
You distract him and I'll grab his pussy.
At least this obsession won't kill us.
Since he climbed out of that whale, he's been a changed man.
I just didn't believe him when he said he would give an arm and a leg for that.
"His scratching post is what won her over".
How do we tell him that the cat organized the mutiny?
That explains the poop deck.
Mistook his peg leg for a scratching post, and it's been love ever since.
He's going to call him Ishmael.
Metaphor my ass.
I'm not accusing anyone. I just haven't seen my parrot.
Honestly, I'm kind of over Captain Ahab's 'sensitivity in the workplace' training.
. . . and I haven't seen my parrot since.
I'd always had him pegged as more of a parrot person.
He calls it Ishmeow
It explains the box on the poop deck.
I think we've lost some of our swagger.
Cap'n changed after he read TS Elliot
I guess we'll be hunting tuna now.
Remember when they used to call us "bloodthirsty?"
Well, call me Ishmew.
Now that they let him bring his emotional support animal on board, he is so much more pleasant to be around.
I reek of fish and he STILL likes him better!
Apparently my parrot was too loud.
I dare you to shout, "Thar she meows!"
It's actually very simple; he's nuts.
The captain isn't going to like the treasure it buried.
Do you think he realizes that peg leg is nothing but a scratch post?
No shark. No, 'twas mice what ate his leg.
Aye, he's much been better since he dumped the comfort whale.
Have you seen my parrot?
I hear he's changed our course for the Canary Islands.
I think we might need to embellish Captain Ahab's story a bit.
There goes our nasty reputation.
The whale didn't love him like he needed to be loved
I just don't want him to get hurt again.
Unless his attitude changes, I'm thinking short story at best.
Up to now, I thought I could always spot a cat person.
He's obsessed with cats and whales as you are with coffee, Starbuck.
He works for The New Yorker
She only likes him because he lets her use his leg as a scratching post.
To be honest, I miss the rats.
So, he still hasn't figured out what happened to the parrot?
Nothing's been the same since he got that complimentary Green Peace tote bag.
When the story's told, let's make it whale rather than a cat.
His parrot left him for another pirate.
We haven't caught a thing since he joined AARP.
We'll resume the whale hunt once cuddle time is over.
I really thought he was a whale person.
This is working much better than that therapy whale.
He just seems so happy, I don't have the heart to tell him that it's dead...
That's his fourth peg leg this month.
I’ll admit, when Ismael first suggested Prozac, I was skeptical.
Now he's obsessed with "the great white kitty".
Does the parrot know?
Since she came aboard, Ahab's got much better at letting things go.
This director's alternate ending of 'Moby Dick' sucks.
His publicist might have oversold this story.
Call me Fishmeal.
If he calls us "purrrates" one more time, I'm quitting.
Best we can do out here for a lap dance.
We mostly pillage for yarn now.
Of course I told him about my allergy.
He used to be a "whale person".
The whale got his leg. The cat got his tongue.
"Puritan chic. Last month he was a Viking. Can't just wear a bandanna and eye patch like everyone else." .
If I had my own built-in scratching post, cats would follow me too.
... And there's treasure buried in her litter box, or so they say.
Three days of chasing and he finally captures the great white cat
I've got a ball of yarn. I could say it's from the both of us.
Well I heard he was allergic to parrots
Apparently he calls him Ishmael.
He's gotten more pussy than both of us combined.
We're going to need a litter box on the poop deck
We should take away his copy of 'The Life of Pi.'
So he finally settles for a Great White Cat. Pathetic.
Could it be that he's ready to move on?
Yeah... I don't think you're getting your cat back, Dave.
He has a scratching post for a leg.
How are we supposed to get to North Korea if we have to sail to Mar-a-Lago every weekend?
Cats love him. They call him Fishmael.
The cat wants fish, we fish.
If I have to swab the litter box one more time I'll mutiny.
I respected him more when he was a whale person.
I like it better than the rescue whale he adopted last year.
But he treats his men like dogs!
Hmm...white whale, white cat, white peg leg. Starting to notice a pattern with Captain Breitbart?
I don't have the heart to tell him Polly didn't 'fly away'.
That purring is interfering with my grrr-ing!
Everybody knows a leprechaun with a peg leg and a cat is bad luck.--
It turns out that all the bluster about the whale was just to energize his base.
He always hated that bird.
She don't purr, she arrs...
Sure, he can fish, but can he row?
His latest plan to take revenge on the white rat that took his leg.
He named her Peg
Well I guess mice stew Mondays are out.
You can kiss that book deal goodbye.
Loves Moby Pussy, hates Moby Dick. Go figure.
I miss the whale.
Of course she likes him better. He's a natural scratching post.
Call me skeptical.
"It ate the parrot".
He's been in a much better mood since he got rid of the whale.
Of course he looks a bit soft--he's a literary pirate.
He use to hold me like that.
I especially hate it when he lets her use his pegleg as a scratching post.
Now that he's settled for a great white cat perhaps we can all go home
He's got a parrot allergy.
The Great American Novel just turned into a Hallmark movie.
No, it was a larger cat that took his leg.
Call me Fishmeal.
If you ask me, the litter box belongs on the poop deck.
When I asked him the cat's name, he said, "Call him Ishmael."
He's been a different man since they started him on Prozac
Arrr! Pegleg always be sucking up to Captain Whiskers.
He calls her Fishmeal.
"The ending needs a rewrite, Melville.
I thought service animals weren't allowed on board.
They're fishing buddies, pretty obsessive fishing buddies.
Clean up the furball, clean out the litter box - we were better off chasing the white whale.
She's only using him for his peg.
Aye, his pillage & plunder days are over.
I wish he'd told us before we left port that "White Whale" was just the name of his lost cat.
Don't let ol' Fluffy fool ya. She's goin' for that second leg.
They call him Ish-meow.
The cat was too much, but now the Lincoln outfit?
He insists the cat be taken to the Canary islands.
Old Long John got the cat right after Polly crapped on his shoulder.
Do you realize that we haven't pillaged one ship since he got that emotional support animal?
One legged tap dancer, and a cat that tells jokes; very popular on the summer circuit.
Great. Two hurricanes, yellow fever and now shedding.
He's your brother-in-law! YOU change the litter box.
Arrr, should we tell him who ate his parrot?
Sure, it's cute. But we won't get more than a teaspoon of oil out of it.
Now I see why he's known as Calico Jack.
Wait. You mean Moby Dick is not the cat?
You may think it'll keep our rations from being rat-infested, but now we're never gonna know if the ship is sinking.
You'll never mutiny, will you, Fluffy? Noooo, you won't.
It's amazing what a little pussy can do for a man obsessed with a large, white whale.
What is an emotional support cat?
Well, that's just great. How can we compete with a guy who has a scratching post for a leg?
There's only one thing he hates more than white whales .... white mice!
I guess we can forget the whale.
Aye, they call themselves Puss and Boot.
Ever since the cat, he hasn't thought about the whale.
I think I know what happened to the parrot.
I don't like it. It's a lousy metaphor.
It's a nice story, but I don't think there's a best-seller in it.
Piracy isn't what it used to be- in my day 25 strokes of the cat was awful.
It's all cuddles now, but wait till he figures out that no one's seen Polly since we left port.
Do you think he knows it ate his parrot?
Prozac is destroying piracy.
The cat should help him keep his mind off the blasted whale
A real captain would only care about the booty.
It's white cats now.
I don't think burying the treasure in a litter box is a good long term solution.
I've seen him like this before, and I can tell you, this is not going to end well!
First that damn whale and now this.
So I says, "White whale? Has I seen a white whale? Captain, I gots something even better! Pound for pound, sir, she's one of the fiercest carnivores and best of all.....hates water.
It hasn't been the same since he wrapped his peg-leg in carpet.
I think I might unfollow him, too.
I don't mind swabbing the poop deck. I do mind cleaning a litter box.
Call me disillusioned.
Hard to believe it bit off his leg.
Some new therapy, supposed to help out with his post-pillaging stress disorder.
He said it was my turn, 15 minutes ago.
I liked it better when the Captain wanted to look like Johnny Depp
Sure, now he can walk -- but he's ruined the chair!
I think he does it to offset the "crazy whale guy" image . . .
I think we know who's been stealin' our yaarn!
Now he says he's looking for some great white tuna...
That's one way to kill our brand.
His therapist recommended it.
I suggest we go back to the parrot and the patch.
I let him stay here until he gets back on his foot.
He's doing a photo shoot in response to the PETA campaign.
See? All he needed was a harmless distraction.
I guess he's ready to hunt the great White Mouse.
Every night, Lincoln dreamt of being a pirate and no longer allergic to cats.
He'll feel differently when that cat uses his other leg as the scratching post.
Moby cat, gives me the creeps, it does.
That anger management course looks like it's working so far.
When he said that he was retiring from the pirate life, I thought he would actually leave.
He keeps saying "What a great white tail!"
I suppose it's a good change in some ways, but searching for a great white mouse isn't going to get us any whale oil.
Peg? He called the cat 'Peg'?
It's from a shelter. Captain says we need to improve our image.
Yes, all who sail the seas fear the name of Blackbeard and Snuggles.
'I think that cat ate his parrot.'
Separately they’re indispensable, but together they’re useless.
So now we have to chase this "Great White Whale" because Ahab promised his stupid cat a "special treat"!
Well, it worked - but now my parrot is missing.
Whatever, I'm glad... Polly was a pain in the ass.
Since he got the kitten he's decided to replace the skull and bones with a smiley face emoticon.
The parrot isn't going to like this.
I miss the old days.
He's taking a break from his raging obsession for revenge.
Every day it is the same. The captain is totally consumed with that white cat.
Ahab is so much nicer since Queequeg started our yoga & meditation class.
Aye, matey. Methinks there be a stowaway emotional support animal on board.
Retirement is a good look for him.
But I wanted him to call ME Ishmael.
Tis the scratchin' post what won 'er over.
I dare you to grab his pussy.
All I am saying is I can't work with a cat person.
Polly's missing.
Good move, I think he's finally stopped talking about strawberries.
Sometimes I think he loves that cat more than he loves pillaging.
The therapy cat seems to be working well...he hasn't mentioned the whale in four hours.
And here all this time I thought Moby Dick was a whale.
Kittens change a man.
It's rehab for Ahab
It's better than when he was obsessed with the whale.
It's supposed to help bring out the jolly in Roger.
I liked him more when he was a dog person
I think the parrot's days are numbered
He never changes the litter on the poop deck.
We'll need ten planks.
This could hurt the book sales.
I think it's time for the intervention
Morale has improved, but I'm just not sure he is captain material.
Polly wanted a cracker but Kitty wanted Polly.
Obsessed? He cut off his own leg just to provide a portable scratch post.
Cat got his affection… and his tongue… and his leg.
It's a therapy cat
Argh! There she purrs!
White whale, white cat, whatever keeps him focused.
He doesn't know that cat ate his parrot !
Before the cat he was Bloody Terror of the High Seas, now he says just call him Frank.
On second thought, he DOES have a leg to stand on.
I hear the cat ate the parrot.
Aye...Captain's all about tuna fishing these days.
It's a therapy cat. Does wonders for obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Not enough arrr, too much awww.
Now we know what happened to the parrot.
His wife got the parrot in the divorce.
We're gonna need a litter box for the poop deck.
You should have seen him before he got a service animal!
It's not like Polly to miss cracker time.
Should we tell him we've spotted the white whale?""Nah, it'll keep.
'The cat has nine lives - makes for a longer novel."
I don't know he keeps promising kitty a really big fish for her birthday dinner?
We're pretty sure it's a rescue.
I think it's the Xanax.
Let's hope the therapy kitty works. God knows we've tried everything else!
If MY leg were a scratching post, she’d love me, too.
I just hope he brought a litter box too or else my poop deck duties got a lot more literal.
The cat prefers him because he's got a built-in scratching post.
And he's got another 15 in his cabin. I don't know how he plans to feed them all.
I know, he's calmed down since getting the cat, but I kind of miss all the craziness with the whale.
Fine, let him clean the poop deck...
Any idea where Polly went?
What's worse, he's got a thousand pounds of kitty litter in the hold, and it's that scented stuff.
He knows this is a Pirates of the Caribbean set, right?
He'll tell you he's a whale person, but he's really a cat person.
I would've stayed home if I knew he was searching for a great white cat.
Cap'n's Prozac be workin'.
He just wanted something white.
I just don't see this new captain as a 'walk the plank' kind of guy
White cat, white sails, white whale . . . A splash of color would be nice.
I don't get the symbolism.
So Ishmael hands him this cat and we ain't heard nuthin' about no white whale since
I had him pegged as a dog guy.
It was more exciting when he was obsessed by the whale.
Call me embarrassed.
None dare call it meowtiny.
I liked him better BEFORE the sensitivity training.
They let in every Tom, Dick, and Harry these days.
aye matey, 'tis a therapy cat.
At least it's less annoying that his therapy parrot.
Do you think he misunderstood when we said guard the kitty?
His ways are eccentric, but they do keep the ship free of rats.
Aye, I wared him about ship kittens once before. Apparently it'll take our captain more than one leg to learn that lesson.
There she purrs!
First his leg and now his arm?! He spoils that cat.
Peg leg or not, I say he'll never fit in.
I hope that cat doesn't think that his peg leg is a scratching post
He gave up on the whale.
Cats love his corduroy. It's wide wale.
He leads a rich and varied life. He plays a pirate here, his evening gig is as Abraham Lincoln---but in his heart, he's a cat lady.
Before the cat arrived they were using his peg leg to plug the mouse hole.
She's cute, but we're spending a fortune on parrots.
I'm not sure about Corporate's re-branding strategy.
It's the literary symbolic obsession du jour--- grabbing one makes him feel "presidential."
Ahab has mellowed since he started taking Prozac.
I still say Tom Hanks wasn't the right choice for this movie.
If I don't get my turn soon, I'm calling for a mutiny.
Yesterday he even said, "Whale, what Whale"?
He went and named the little scamp Moby Dickens.
He went from "Arrrrr" to "Awwwww" overnight.
I miss the doubloons—now all we plunder is pieces of string.
He's just not fitting in.
Last voyage it was gerbils.
Cats love him. He's got a gentle touch and a built-in scratching post.
Hey... is that Daniel Day-Lewis?
I tell ye, Starbuck, It's an ungodly obsession with the beast.
Aye, there's them that claim he's a leprechaun.
You tell him what happened to his parrot.
'E just 'asn't been the same since 'e started seeing that lady from Greenpeace.
It's the Zoloft.
Maybe getting a cat to catch a parrot was a bad idea.
He's too tall to be a leprechaun...
We hated that damn parrot.
Who'd have guessed this was all about finding whale flavored cat food?
I suggested a parrot but he said I didn't have a peg to stand on.
He'll never get the hair off that suit.
That's how he and Moby Dick were in the early days too.
Looks like the captain fell in love with tonight's dinner.
Call him Captain Rehab.
No, no. Ye be talking about Bartleby the scrivener. This be his cousin, Barnaby the kittener.
Purring in the morning, sailors take warning...
We have a no cat's rule on this ship, but he says it's his service cat, Lefty!
Wait...Mr. Buttons is Ishmael??
Our good luck charms make us look soft.
That used to be me sitting in his lap and listening to the stories.
Let's just say we're all stumped.
I put up with that stupid parrot, but I draw the line at cats.
Buying that therapy cat was the best money we ever spent.
Meowby Dick? Lacks a certain gravitas.
This fantasy cruise looked a lot more fun in the travel brochure.
Argh! It's a poop deck, not a litter box!
Personally, I think we're going to need a larger predator than that.
He doesn't realize yet that the cat ate the parrot.
Ahab's nuts! I'm not calling out, "There she purrs," when Mrs. Mittens appears on the deck.
In 100 years the English Lit majors will have to unravel it.
Me thought the Airbnb listing said "no pets".
Call me Ishmael. Call her Fluffy.
There's no rats left to ever abandon this sinking ship.
Aye, 'twas Mousie Dick that took his leg.
What a fool. She's only into him for his peg leg.
He misunderstood what I said we needed on this boat.
We'll never get our deposit back after she scratches up our hardwood floors.
No, Ishmael, you can't. We'll all look like idiots.
If it helps Ahab rehab, I'm all for it.
Ay, cap'n's been calm seas every since he got his emotional support animal.
It's how he deals with the agony of de feet
And you thought my mermaid obsession was weird.
PETA: Pirates for the Ethical Treatment of Animals
Aye, the Captain's gone made. Cut off his own leg and replaced it with a scratching post.
It's much healthier than his last obsession.
Fake 'Mews'
Representative Lincoln will never win the presidency, grabbing pussies and mocking the handicapped.
He calls her Miss Shmael.
Must be the Prozac.
We've got to raise our recruiting standards.
It's the only one that hasn't scratched his wooden leg.
Aye, that's what the cat dragged in!
Thank God he finally caught that great white cat.
He wanted a meerkat. But he settled for a mere cat.
He's been like that since the election.
The cats have loved him ever since he got that scratching post.
"That social security check has definitely made him less blood thirsty
He's been that way ever since the parrot died.
He said when you're a star they just let you do it.
He told me he's done flying United
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm starting to miss his obsession with cute whale videos.
I miss when he did that to us.
He's done with white whales, now he's into white cats.
Arr! He calls it Moby Lick.
The creepy bit is... he's named it Shamu.
That would explain the kitty litter on the poop deck!
If only he loved pillaging as much as he loves that cat.
I get the cat, but the hat?
Well, anything to get his mind off of whales I guess.
You can either be a cat person or a Puritan Uncle John; not both.
Well, he's certainly not a whale person.
That's the Captain...and Tenille.
Meanwhile, the rats are multiplying.
We should've gotten that cat a long time ago.
Just because he's the Captain, he thinks he grab any pussy he wants.
Twas a lot more excitin round ere, fore that cat ate the parrot!
It seems the captain misunderstood when I told him what we all planned to get on shore leave.
He was hoping for a whale.
When you're famous like him, you can just grab them.
If I ever write a book about this, I'm gonna make that cat some other animal.
They call him Puss n' Boot.
She likes his built-in scratching post.
He's been depressed ever since Jonah disappeared
I'd kill rodents for that kind of attention.
In real life, Blackbeard is nothing like his bloodthirsty filibuster public persona.
Eye Matey, I think I know what happened to your parrot.
I just heard him say "you scratch mine and I'll scratch yours".
He's not really a parrot person.
I sure miss that old parrot!
I always suspected he wasn't the sea dog type!
Ever since he joined Pirates Anonymous, he has turned a bit soft.
Cat and a hat?
And now he's obsessed with a white CAT!
Yeah, he says he can just grab them because he is famous.
It's a service cat.
I don't think I can handle another white animal obsession.
Never seen anything like it... he purrs more than the cat.
It's been pretty boring ever since he got the therapy cat.
I told you not to shoot his parrot.
Aye, it be Moby Mittens, the white kitty.
He had his leg replaced with a scratching post for First Mate Whiskers. If anyone in Boston asks, give 'em the whale story.
Getting him 'The Great White Cat' was pure genius, Fred.
Well that explains the poop deck.
It looks like Roger's finally jolly.
The cat has to go. It's not good for our image.
The mystery of the vanishing parrot had been narrowed to two suspects.
Can't do a thing about it...his doc says it's an emotional support animal.
First a white mouse, now a white cat. Ahab's pattern of obsessions worries me.
It wouldn't be a poop deck if he would get a litter box.
Call me Ishmeow'el.
Morale's sure improved since we pillaged that pet store.
Cap'n seems to have forgiven Tabby for eating Polly.
Ever since that devil cat came aboard captain's been searching for the great white sardine.
There goes our deposit!
There was a mix-up at the doctor's office. It turns out that he's allergic to large aquatic mammals.
He had to put his parrot in the witness protection program.
Just *try* getting into the captain's lap since she came along.
You should see the videos he uploads on YouTube...
Tropical climates can change a man!
Yes, Moby is a great white kitty, but I think we're going to need to spin this a bit or never mention it in the pub.
These retirement cruises are really boring!
It's their love of sushi.
It took his leg off, but I guess you can't hold a grudge against a cat for ever.
Codfather, Part I
Ever since he got Mr. Whiskers, he just hasn't seemed interested in raping and pillaging.
Don’t be insulted by Max and Joe, they’re trying not to grab anything by the pussy these days.
It's being groomed for the cat o' nine tails.
These visits to the new world are making him soft
I think Melville got this guy all wrong. He's a real animal lover at heart.
Cat bourguignon, chicken fried cat, cat Wellington, . . .
Well blow me down. He has a warm and fuzzy side.
It's smaller, cuter, and fluffier, but it's still an obsession.
WE called it Ishmael. HE calls it bait.
It's weirder when he lets it sharpen its claws.
I know that look. We're about to attack the Canary Islands again.
No, the whale represents evil. The cat's just a cat.
Arrgh — I guess we'll need to put litter on the poop deck now.
Soon enough he's going to lose that hand too.
Just watch. All that anger's gonna resurface somewhere.
Now they call him "Ishmeow."
Somehow 'great white cat' doesn't have the same ring.
It's the only thing that takes his mind off the whale.
We've moved away from the plank to a more evidence based practice, pet therapy.
And why couldn't I bring my pet snake?
The cat's name is Peggy. You can't make this stuff up.
If there's a chapter about every kind of cat in the world, I quit.
He used to be more of a whale person.
Ever since Whiskers came on board all we hunt is tuna.
If you ask me, he's become nothing but a scratching post!
He says to keep an eye out for a much larger white metaphor.
He named her Peg
But where's Polly?
Pet therapy. He's forgotten all about Moby Dick.
Kitty loves him only for his scratching post.
I thought it was called a plank, not a catwalk.
There were no cats in the original script. Now we gotta worry about a whale AND a cat?
Well, so much for going after the whale.
Captains been hitting the rum too hard and sits all day saying "nice white whale, nice white whale"
No, it's bait.
If I had a scratch pole for a leg that cat would like me too...
So if the cat is Moby Dick, is this a tragedy or a farce?
Word has it that it's his therapy cat.
I'm just not sure I can write 625 pages about a cat.
Starbuck's allowing support animals now?
He's promised her a very big treat.
It helps him keep his mind off of bigger things.
There she purrs!
I thought he was a "whale person"
Call me allergic.
Let's face it - he's just not a parrot person.
They call him Ish-meow.
It's like he forgot that we have whiskers too.
This all started with the mysterious disappearance of his parrot.
Yes they do! Leprechauns grow Up!
The whale was not much of a mouser.
Look what the cat dragged in.
They're cute now, but wait till she uses him like a scratching post.
Rumor has it that we're just out here looking for cat food.
Arrgh, what's the captain's new obsession called - Moby Lick?
He's grabbing pussy again
He named her Meow-by Dick.
The parrot will be fine, he said. No danger to the parrot, he said.
He used to touch my whiskers like that.
He says he's going to call it Ishmael.
He even lets her use his leg as a scratching post.
His therapist thinks behavior modification therapy will help him deal with his whale issue.
Well, Pip. That changes the whole story.
A ready supply of rats and a built-in scratching post. What more could she ask for?
Aye, he caught the Great White Kitty.
He seems so content, don't tell him we just sighted Moby.
Listen, Ishmael. If you're gonna write a story - make it more dramatic than Ahab's obsession with that damned white cat.
He gets companionship, and the cat gets a scratching post.
I told you not to name him Moby.
He pets that cat day after day hoping that she'll cough up Polly.
He just doesn't have the same fire in his belly as when we set out.
They say he had words with the parrot.
Today it's that white cat, and next week I suppose it'll be something else.i
I don't mind the cat, but he's drinking all the rum.
Looks more like he belongs in one o' them Dickens novels than a sea adventure.
Of all the captains in the world, we get stuck with Mewbeard.
It helps him deal with his post-Cetacean depression.
His new bait for the whale
Have you seen my parrot?
With the keelhaulings down, I knew something was wrong.
He's not a real pirate. He's from Tampa.
Seriously, he named his cat "peg".
Save the cat. The old guy goes down with the ship.
He's a natural on the catwalk.
Mr. Boots is just lucky I left my laser pointer back on shore.
So scurvy dogs are out?
'He's obsessed with a great white cat' just doesn't have the same ring to it.
Wait til the cat sees the hook where his other hand would be.
No, nobody has seen the parrot.
Me thinks the Xanax is kicking in.
He better not be giving that cat any of OUR catnip. That's all I got to say.
So I heard he faked his death so he didn't have to lie to Mary Todd about here looks.
He's retraining as a scratching post.
He keeps muttering to the cat something about finally catching " The Great White Rodent"....
I know, but I just thinking opting to get a scratching post for a leg was a little extreme.
Something tells me he didn't get a cat to "just catch the mice."
One minute it's all about a great white whale, and next it's about a small gray tabby. Go figure.
It's not just a prosthetic, it's also a scratching post.
I used to be his favorite.
He's lost his edge.
He claims it's whale bait.
It's a cat, a white cat.
Just wait until he marks the spot.
The pet therapy has really calmed him down.
When you're a captain, they let you do it. You can do anything. Whatever you want....
First the ship's dog disappears, then he loses half a leg and now he's making friends with the ship's cat. I'm getting more and more afraid to eat the cook's weekly Manhattan Clam Chowder Special.
There is only one person I know of that can grab the pussy and get away with it.
Sure she's cute. He's not the one cleaning the poop deck.
It'll be sardines we're chasing forever and a day till we're rid of that pussy.
Let him keep the cat; it distracts him from the phantom pain.
It's a galley-cat.
Except for the peg leg I don't think he is pirate material.
Lose a limb, get a service animal. It's in our union contract. Arrrrgh.
His leg says pirate, but the rest of him screams Amish.
On the other hand, I don't miss the rats.
He had a therapy dog, but it kept chewing his leg.
Good news. The cat-o-nine-tails has been replaced.
The last cap'n preferred em with nine tails
That's right: Moby Dick is a cat!
Old Ahab won't rest easy until he catches the great white mouse....
Say what ye will, but no one's been flogged since the Cap'n got that cat.
He says to forget the whale and go catch some tuna.
It's his service animal
The Captain says we can keep both of them .
Can you believe what HR is sending up here now?
Cats love the built-in scratching post.
I know we have a strict no pet policy, but he showed me a bona fide emotional support letter.
Conquering any white animal seems to satisfy him
Argh, let's grab that Pussy!
Never saw a wooden leg she didn't like.
Let's heave him over but spare the cat's nine lives.
I don't blame him. You try petting a whale.
It's getting too soft around here.
Good suggestion, chasing the Small White.
Hmmm, Maybe the ship's psychologist knows what he's doing.
If it keeps 'im from thinkin' 'bout that blasted whale, I'll fetch vermin for it meself!
He's our token homeless guy.
I didn't know leprechauns love cats.
He travels the high seas with an emotional support animal?
He loves it so much he turned his leg into a scratch post.
You'd never know he's obsessed with Moby Dick.
Aye, we're headed home, thanks to the 'great white comfort cat, Moby Pussy.'
You tell him it ate the parrot.
It's the damnedest thing. She uses it as a scratching post, and he's found a lifelong friend.
"Call it, Ishmael", he says.
"Wait a minute, wasn't he always talking about a white whale?'
He lets the cat use it for a scratching post.
I don't think his white cat is so great.
Yeah, well I knew him when he had two cats.
Weirdest looking parrot I've ever seen
Those who deny pussy to others deserve it not for themselves.
That's it, I'm not swabbing the poop deck anymore.
I agree, but are you going to tell him that particular pet therapy sunk his leviathan drive?
Cat came in a box labeled "Call me Ishmael."
It's all about workplace diversity.
I've never seen Roger jollier.
We're pirates in international waters, and we still cannot tell him he's not allowed a service animal for his stress disorder?
We're not allowed to say "poop deck" anymore. He makes us call it the "catio."
I have fed Snowball everyday for months, and this puritanical stowaway comes along, and gets all the cuddles!
Well, this is awkward.
Just remember, call it Ismael.
Service cat for flogging trauma.
It all began when this stupid parrot said: "Polly wants a kitty!"
I miss the parrot's one-liners.
You'd think so, but Captain actually calls him "Steve."
Good village pillagers are getting hard to find.
He calls him Ismael
He's done a lot to break the stereotypes of pirates, but this deck isn't going to mop itself.
Part of the Captain's passenger diversity program.
He believes his leg will grow back if he rubs a cat in the middle of the ocean on a full moon day.
When he gets crazy and starts talking about making one of us walk the plank, we give him the cat and the hat and he calms right down.
Did you know I almost became a pirate? Now there's a man's life....
That be the famous Captain Kitt
He said, "Look! A whale!" And when I turned my head, he grabbed my pussy...
he hasn't been the same since he read 'eat pray love'
Ever since he got that cat the entire ship has been the poop deck.
I think he said its name is Ishmael.
Canary? That looks like the cat that swallowed my parrot.
Looks like we solved the white cat obsession.......hope that's the end of it!
"Puss and Boot are at again'
Yeah, but whales only have one life.
It bugs me that he also calls her Ishmael.
His meds must be working. He's setting realistic goals.
Aaarrrggghhh! He just sits there like that since the cat ate his parrot.
He survived the whale but the cat got his tongue.
He's named it Moby. I think he's just given up.
Sure, it's fine now. But wait'll it needs a scratching post.
You go tell him we forgot the cat food.
The cat represents a transitional love object for him due to a disrupted infantile bond he had with his mother. Very common.
I've got a bad feeling about this. Toxoplasmosis is nothing to mess with.
Call him Captain Rehab.
It's just ruining his tough-guy image, don't you think?
Should we tell him what REALLY happened to his parrot?
How did he get past the interview?
Ever since he retired he's gotten so sentimental.
He's cute, but those claws will destroy that peg leg.
And I thought the parrot was bad.
The cat got promoted after his parrot went 'missing'
Call Cap'n Scratchpost a sea dog and ye sleep with the catfishies.
His therapist recommended it over the conventional parrot.
De gustibus non est disputandum.
When I first heard that they were putting therapy pets aboard the Pequod, I thought the idea was nuts.
Now he says we're looking for a gteat white mouse.
I'm told he used to be a whale person.
Wait 'til he finds out the cat ate the parrot.
He never cuddles me like that.
They have been inseparable since the whale died
Roger sure seems jolly since he grabbed that pussy.
He says he has a great white tail.
Without the rats, the fire has just gone out of him.
If you ask me, there's no such thing as the Great White Squeaky Toy.
I must admit, a search for the great white mouse does sound a bit less dangerous.
Quadrupeds make him feel whole
He thought the parrot talked too much.
The crew's talkin intervention.
Thar she purrrrrrrrs
To be honest, when he bragged that he grabs them by the pussy, this wasn't what I had in mind.
His latest obsession. We may make it back to Nantucket yet.
I heard he got it from a breeder.
Call him Ishmeow.
I know, I know, I hired him but didn't know he was a Lepreicaun't.
He's here because he's not all there.
It's so unfair. They wouldn't let me bring my parrot!
Sure beats chasing that damn whale!
I mean, we are giving AUTHENTIC PIRATE TOURS!!!" "How the hell did that cat get 50k instagram followers?
His cat, Moby, has really mellowed him.
Believe me, it's his better obsession.
Things haven't been the same since that parrot died
He gets totally obsessed really easily!
A great white cat?......He may have adjusted HIS goals, but Im still here for the rum.
So I told him "No, there ain't no litter box on the poop deck!"
Ever since he saw The Godfather it's him and that damn cat.
Okay, let's all be nice and casual until the Green Peace ship passes.
She came back nine times--now's the time to bet.
I'll let you guess what it uses as a scratching post.
'Studies show that it helps prevent mutinies."
Everytime we start talking mutiny, he shows us his redeeming qualities.
She's cozying up on account of the scratching post.
He only lost his leg so he could get a therapy cat.
I'd give my right arm for a good dog.
Yell 'thar she blows' and let's see what he does.
Service pets are the rage for Americans these days, get used to it.
He never lets me do that.
He keeps muttering, 'I'm going to catch you the biggest snackie you ever saw!'
He's gone full James Bond villain.
She only loves him for his scratching post.
If it wasn't for the leg you'd swear that Pete wasn't a real pirate.
He's trained it to use the poop deck.
The new therapy for his whale obsession has proven to be very effective.
Service cat, my eye!
The captain's hooked.
Peg leg Pete has really put that broken chair to good use
He calls it "Ishmael", and claims he taught it how to write.
Maybe this would be a good time to ask for a raise.
And why wouldn't they be close. He's got an appendage that doubles as a scratching post."
The doctor gave Ahab something called Prozac.
I tell 'ya, it's that therapy cat that changed him.
I always thought Long John Whiskers referred to his beard
I don't care what he says, I was a much better first mate than Mr. Whiskers.
In a perfect world, he would be navigating and she would be chasing rats.
And yet below we've still got rats the size of cantaloupes
So all this time, we should have focused on the 'white' part over the 'whale' part?
Since he got his therapeutic cat, he forgot all about the big white whale.
Yeah, he found out that white whales are just crazy about cats.
Aye, I don't think our Cap'n has the stuff to inspire a classic novel.
Who will be afraid of a pirate ship with a therapy cat?
I'm not scrubbing the litter deck.
The Captain says we can keep em both
I don't mind the cat so much as the branding problems.
Shiver me timbers, that beast is tamed. Although, it did cost he a leg
Yes, but it's a great white cat.
Don't be fooled, this is how the last trip started. Believe me, it's not going to end well.
I understand he has a therapist letter approving his having a therapy dog.
I wouldn't have pegged him for a cat fancier.
He settled for Moby cat.
Looks like great white whale has gone soft white kitty.
He's hooked on pain killers.
He grabbed it yet the boss still hired him.
So Melville heard--get this!--white tail as white _whale_.
He's only three quarters Irish.
What happened to the parrot?
I'm not calling it Fishmael.
I don't care if he is the captain. There's no way a whale will go for cat bait.
It's only a matter of time before he realizes who ate his parrot
Well, we do have the only rat free ship in the fleet
Apparently his physical therapist thought it would help
I first noticed a change after he joined PETA
#notmycaptain
When Kitty gets a peg leg, then I'll welcome her as one of the crew.
Don't get me wrong...I'm fine with gay sailors, but this guy kinda makes me uncomfortable.
Now I'm suspicious about the booty he said he'd share with us.
Who'd ever name his cat Ishmael?
Yaar! Me thinks Peg-leg Willy's become a hipster.
Who's going to tell him what happened to Polly?
I thought it might calm him down.
Oh, him?... He's one of them Pirates of Penance.
Now he's obsessed with a white kitty. # Sad.
You call her. You're the one that named her Peggy.
I think he misunderstood the President's message.
Have ye seen me canary?
Arrrr! I wouldn't have voted him captain if I'd known THAT'S what he meant!
Call me, Dumb, mate, but the Whiteness of the Cat ruined a great novel.
She'll never see him as anything but a scratching post.
So the captain said we can ask if it's a service animal, but he's not required to show documentation
That's not what he was chasing this morning.
I didn't peg him as a cat person.
Let's turn the ship around while he is distracted.
Anything that keeps his attention away from you-know-who.
They bonded the day the cat saw him crunch a mouse with his peg...
What a strange fellow! He's sitting there by himself and just playing with his pussy.
SO HE SAYS TO ME, WHERE EXACTLY IS THE POOP DECK.
Of course she likes him best, he has a built in scratching post.
That guy is so 17th century
Mate, its time to show the Captain the cat walk.
...But NO, I can't have a pet barnacle.
Best rat catcher on the high seas. And his cat is pretty good, too.
His devotion to that thing is admirable. But to replace his leg with a scratching post, well, I think it's going overboard.
Ahab is responding nicely to pet therapy.
Pretend you don't notice it...It was a gift from his mother.
I miss the mice.
And then Mrs. Ahab said, 'It's either me or the cat.'
Just because he's retired doesn't mean he can violate the "no pets" policy.
He said, "Because a can of tuna isn't good enough for my Captain Snuggles, that's why."
Well, we always knew he wasn't a whale-lover.
I couldn't compete with a built-in scratching post.
They're doing a sequel.
As obsessions go, the Captain could do a lot worse than that great white cat.
Damned if I know. Go ask Ishmael.
But the first mate should be a person.
Because his finicky cat only eats white meat, that's why.
Aye, it's been like this ever since the parrot disappeared.
Fact: cat therapy is inversely proportional to narrative momentum.
He used to be a "whale person".
... when you're a captain they let you do it.
T'is true- he let's him use it as a scratching post.
The whale was becoming a problem. We needed a stopgap.
The boss can't keep his hands off the pussy.
Aye, when ye be a star, they let ye do it. Ye can do anything.
The man's gone daft for that cat. When I suggested we call it "Puff," he said it was "Mewtiny!
He's a star. He can do that whenever he wants.
Easier on the limbs than the pet croc.
At least he found the great white cat.
Aye, 'tis an emotional support animal.
Tom Hanks made this all seem too glamorous.
It is Mrs. Peck's chill out gesture.
Scuttlebutt be it's Bob Dylan layin' low from the Nobel Committee.
He thinks she's in love with him, but he's really just a scratching post to her.
Soon or later that thing is going to eat the boss's parrot.
He used to have such a beautiful wooden leg
He's much happier after letting her out of the bag.
His service cat.
It wasn't so cute when he tried to cuddle the whale that way.
A WHITE cat?
White whale? No, no, it's white tail the captain is on the hunt for.
He said she was going to be all of ours kitten
I'm thinkin' we should tack some carpet on that peg leg...
He asks us to call him "Ishmeowel"
You think that's weird? He just bought two theatre tickets from that guy Wilkes-Booth down in the galley.
I think I read this story in high school.
And he takes a scratching post with him wherever he goes.
He's our software pirate.
Gold doubloons don't love you back.
Don't tell him your joke about the three-legged cat.
Which one's the orange, furry?
It's the great white tail that attracted him.
He only likes it because it says, "Aarrrrg."
Watch what you say around the cat, she tells him everything.
Okay, I made mistake hiring him, but his resume did say wooden leg and beard.
If that darn cat keeps scratching the table legs, I know where I'll find a spare.
...some sort of symbiotic relationship. He scratches her and she scratches his peg-leg
He finally outgrew the box of Lucky Charms.
Aye, our new ship's carpenter. Calls himself, Chairleg.
I wish that cat ate something besides whale meat.
A few drinks and he'll be saying it was a great white whale he caught.
It's supposed to help temper his urge to pillage and plunder.
Now we're going to have to put up with Captain Ahab's white cat wailing.
I suppose that's one way to keep the pi'rats' away
We keep telling him and telling him that's A GREAT WHALE OF A WHITE CAT you have. Let's hope it works.
Ever since he grabbed that pussy, he hasn't mentioned Moby Dick.
His literary agent suggested he go with the 'great white whale' angle instead of his diabetes.
I'm tryin' to get off these blasted cruises full of retirees and back to the real action.
They found her in his left boot!
He's going to call him Ishmael.
Man, whatever keeps him from puking all over my ship
He's just OBSESSED with that animal.
I think a cat goes against the entire pirate ethos.
Ever since he got rid of those termites, he's a new man.
Calling the cat Moby was one thing, but I'll be damned if I let him call me Ishmael.
''It's the cat that gives me pause.''
Aaargh Matey...apparently the kitty has no sense if smell!
He loves to cry 'thar she purrs!'
Lucky you with the nine lives.
It's time he got a new pet. He was crushed when they told him he had to put down his white whale.
The built-in scratching post sealed it.
He may have named the cat, 'Patches', but ee's no pirate!
Must be the velvet paw that but conceals a remorseless fang.
That cat is the only one that's forgiven the captain for losing the treasure map.
Aarrgh, he frosts me lucky charms.
Surprising what a little pussy can do.
In my own little corner, in my own little chair, I can be whoever I want to be.....
Ever since his run in with Moby Dick, he prefers the quiet purring of albino cats.
He's whipped.
I think he has lost his edge...
Don't care if it is mutiny, I ain't changing that litter box again.
Ever since the first mate left and opened that coffee shop, the captain has lost interest in that whale.
It gets worse...our new flag is a paw-and-fishbones.
After he discovered her name was Peg they became inseparable.
All I'm saying is, since he got that cat, we've suffered an 80% drop in net pillage and plunder.
Who knew the old dog was a cat person?
They met online.
I wanted a parrot.
First class gets a chair AND a pet now.
He's not the same since we went cat fishing.
I hate it when he plays with the bait.
Don't tell him it ate his parrot.
"At least someone's getting some".
He decided to call him Ishmael.
He's been very quiet since the cat's got his tongue.
He's a new man since he sold the rights to the name Starbuck.
Well I wouldn't say he's been the best navigator, but he has certainly done a marvelous job ending the rat problem.
Not sure about this voyage... He asked, "Call me Ish-meow-el!"
I get the hat, you get the cat.
It's cute. He uses the wooden leg for his claw pole.
I'll string up from the yardarm the b-b-bastard that took my pooty tat.
He woke up one night and the cat was using his peg as a scratching post.
Ahab has found his Moby Kit.
He just signed a book deal with Melville.
I'll say this much for him, things have been calmer he since he changed the captain into a cat.
I thought Bob Mankoff retired. Why's he still here?
Damn! This is what happens when you take the Naval code too literally.
Aye, me thinks Cap'n A is losing his edge ... I even saw him let Mobette scratch his peg leg.
Cause no one will believe he was looking for his great white cat.
Say what you want--pet therapy works!
Now there's a Christmas card moment.
Aye, Matie, look what the cat dragged in.
He was right after all. No mice, no rats, no parrots.
"I say, never trust a cat lover....
I reckon Captain's got an obsession with white mammals.
He named him 'Captain Cat Sparrow'
O Captain! #notmycaptain!
He got rid of his parrot because it kept talking back.
She thinks he's a scratching post.
...and that was the last cracker Polly got.
After the whale got his leg, the cat got his tongue so now he just sits a lot without saying a word.
Keep the crew below deck until he finishes his meditation.
That's the Captain, and his cat Black Purrrrl.
Next thing you know he'll want fancy divers on the gang plank!
He's a lot happier since he go rid of his pet woodpecker.
I figured him for the dog type.
I wonder what his parrot will think of this...
I hear it won't eat anything but white meat. Where are we going to get that way out here?
To be a peg leg or a pussy foot - that is the question!
Oh yeah! He DOES look like Abe.
Kitty's got a built-in scratching post.
Call me a shlameal, but next time I grow grim about the mouth and account it high time to get to sea, find me a cat.
Man over bored.
Aye, he struck a hard bargain for that cat.
They converted him at the last port. He hasn't been the same since.
I wouldn't mind so much, if the litter box wasn't in me bunk.
Yea, like Melville is going to write the quintessential American novel about a great white cat...time to find a new ship Queequeg
It's a long story.
Should we tell Long John Silver that his new best friend ate his old best friend?
Well, I for one can only see myself pillaging and plundering with someone who considers himself a DOG captain.
With my allergies, I'm just going to have to tell him, it's me or the cat.
Annoying, yes. But I Haven't seen a mouse in over a week.
Rock, paper, scissors to see who tells him about the food shortage.
Moody,? Yes. Irascible? Sometimes. But he's extremely goal oriented.
He retired after the shark attack, but he still likes to keep one foot on the deck.
I say toss the unlucky thing over the side and blame it on that white whale following us
His Shrink suggested a therapy cat.
He says it's his "sARRRRvice animal."
Arrr we are easing him in with the cat o' one tail.
Abraham Sinkin was blissfully unaware of the meowtiny afoot.
Aye, his obsession with that little white cat will get used all killed
He's one of the strangest cats I know; don't let the suit fool you.
Maybe we'll finally stop having to search for that Great White Mouse.
Shall we tell him it's for dinner?
Of course he means us. We're the only rats left.
Apparently it's his first cruise.
Should we break the news to him that the cat actually ate the parrot?
Things have been sooo much more chill since we got him the white cat.
If our raid tonight is against another tuna boat, I'm thinkin' of quittin'.
Call me disgusted.
Captain's seem more relaxed and less obsessive since converting the Pequod to shrimping.
He's obsessed with that cat.
They've finally adjusted his meds.
The Amish look I can handle, but the cat?
WHAT'S NEXT? FIRST THE WHALE GOT HIS LEG. NOW THE CAT HAS HIS TONGUE!
At least there is a lot less damage to the furniture with the built in scratching post.
Arg, I told him to bring up the cat o' nine tails. And he brought up fluffy.
The parrot was too messy.
Should we tell him it ate his parrot?
That parrot was my best friend.
It was the worst of times on a dark and stormy night when he named the cat Ishmael.
First of all, that's not Abraham Lincoln and even if it was, he's not grabbing that pussy. He's petting it.
Aye, an odd one he is...claims to have a new book idea called, 'The Cat in Me Hat'!
He never got over losin' that whale
If they're gonna let the retired guys stay on board, they should at least make them dress like pirates.
It was bad enough when he refused to dress like a pirate. Then he insisted on having a chair on deck but having tamed our best mouser just is wrong……
Looks like chef is contemplating something different for dinner tonight.
He said, "If Trump can do it, so can I!" And then he grabbed my pussy!!
This ship is for pirates not pussies!
I've been here for 20 years and he just walks on board as furst mate.
He just sits there, very pleased with himself, and says when he gets to the New World he's gonna be a mover and quaker ......
That bastard grabbed my pussy.
When was the last time you pet me like that?
He’s getting the peg-leg fare. The cat’s a service animal. That’s all I know.
Captain Ahab has toned down his obsession.
He calls it Melville. Go Figure.
With him, everything is either an allegory, a metaphor or an allusion.
Are you SURE that's the real Calico Jack?
His obsession with that thing will be his undoing.
Aargh, Blackbeard thinks this is a retirement cruise ship!
Trust me. After my last captain, his obsession with the cat is refreshing.
He calls her Fishmeal.
Doncha know, it was that very cat's mother, the tigress, who took his left arm and leg.
He thinks this is a Carnival Cruise Ship. I don't have the heart to explain the pirate thing to him.
The little bastard's eaten my last three parrots.
So, whose idea was this retired pirates cruise?
Should we tell him we're looking for Treasure Island, not Ellis Island?
Kitty-cat's litter box is on the poop deck.
Yeah he seems happier. But he's lost interest in the white whale entirely.
To be fair, he had lost the fire before he got the cat.
He's going to need a bigger cat.
I suppose its better than the white whale.
I think it's the lithium.
I haven't had good Chinese food since that cat came aboard.
Whatever, more rum for us
Turns out he's more of a cat guy than a whale guy.
No way he's getting soft. He's going to use it as bait.
So now he's all "Call me Ishmeow."
I didn't want the cat to like me anyway.
He's been like this since his parrot flew off.
I say we tie that scurvy cat to the yardarm.
He's training it to stuff itself into a blowhole on the inhale.
Yeah, he’s obsessed, but it could be worse.
We welcome his pause for paws, the only time he stops talking.
D'ye see him? Ahab never thinks; he only feels, feels, feels ...
Trust me, Muffin will have the Capn chasing white rats like a Skinnerist.
He's losing his piratin' edge. I saw Mr. Whiskers using his leg as a scratching' post.
He seems happier since he got the cat and gave up on that whale.
It's new corporate policy to be loving and caring towards animals!
Over medicated. Again.
Who let Steve Lincoln on the boat and why is he playing with dinner?
Aye, that guy's the only one without cat scratch fever. It's got everyone down below.
I'll tell ye mate, that cat's rehab for Ahab.
He's compensating for something.
He's hooked.
I threw a few bottles overboard this week with my C.V. stuffed inside.
He lost his leg, but found his heart.
Two monomaniacs. No wonder they get along.
But who says things like "so conceived and so dedicated" to a kitty-cat?
That whale has had a lasting effect on him.
Sassy Pants better have more than nine lives after the Captain finds out he ate the parrot.

Some pirate he turned out to be
You know how the Cat 'O' Nine tails is one tail short? I think I've found a solution.
He's decided to start with a cat and work up to a whale.
I sure as hell didn't sign up for half a year of him sitting in the sunshine with that damned cat, muttering 'Who's my great white whale?'

The politically correct expression is 'passenger' and not 'prisoner' apparently.
All I know is he was up all night shouting "Have you seen the white cat?".
A cat o' one tail? Might as well not flog him at all.
It'd break his heart if he found out what happened to the parrot.
Thus, he gave up the spear.
He's not the same Ahab we knew and hated.
The cat's cute, but I think I'll need something scarier for the novel.
Cute little galley cat. I think I'll name you Bowlin. Bowlin Galley.
Ishmael, I see the Captain finally lowered his expectations.
..so you do like the parrot with a dash of sea salt...

There's a book in this. Needs work though.
He says he wants to write a book about his white cat and call it Mopsy Dick.
That's Captain Fondafelines. Don't rub his cat the wrong way or you'll be walkin' the plank.
I hope Bob's retirement will be more fun than this.
Heh heh heh, 'Puss and Boot', that's funny.
Let's order some more tests.
He hasn't been the same since he joined facebook.
He's been reading Trump again
His therapist said "try a white cat instead of a white whale"
God save us if Little White One bites off his thumb.
I'm concerned that captain Ahab is getting a little obsessed with that little white mouser.
I'm telling you Melville, no one's ever gonna believe a story about a man obsessively searching the world for pussy.
I bet we spend the whole voyage chasing that damn cat!
He settled for less.
They became friends when the cat started using his peg leg as a scratching post.
No, I don't know where the captain picked up that guy in the hat.
And it sharpens its claws on his leg.
I'm telling you, the cat's a snob.
Seamus the salty-dog at sea, ‘Simon’ the ship cat was loved by he. - Crewmen scoffed: ‘Unnatural affection!’, Seamus oblivious to any abjection; - Canoodled unruffled by gale, rat, or flea.
The Captain says we can make money transporting passengers. He calls it Ubarrrrrrr.
He hasn't been the same since he gave up on the great white whale and turned his attention to the little white kitty.
a
The rumor going around is someone didn't clean the new boss's litter box.
Aaarrrggghhh! Ever since the cat ate his parrot, he's no good for anything.
I don't think he was clear about what Trump meant.
His last service animal was a whale, so this is better for us.
Think this will work?
First he lost the whale, now he's lost his mind.
Cap'n says to call it Ishmael.
Aye, but he promises to feed it and take care of it.
As a couple, they're deadwood.
He's been that way since the folks from Greenpeace stopped by.
The new cat loves the scratching post.
Polly want another parrot?
I hate it when the cook gets that look in his eye.
When he takes up knitting, it's either mutiny or the M & A guys.
I'll swab the deck, but don't be expectin' me to clean the first mate's litter box!
Of course the cat favors him. He has a built-in scratching post.
That's that unlucky bastard Nugent. Nasty case of cat scratch fever.
This therapy cat works great. Joe does not wear his eye patch any more!
They gave the captain a wooden leg, how come kitty wasn't given eight wooden tails?
I'm pretty sure that's not Blackbeard. And that's definitely not a parrot.
No human likes to be lonely
Is that the new management?", "Arrrr, he's not from around these parts!
Your turn to remind him to change the kitty litter.
Cat's called Ishmael. He talks to it like it's a person, always going on about some white whale we're supposedly chasing.
It’s no accident he calls each one “Chum.”
Get a load of Captain 'Emo'
"Wouldn't have pegged you as a cat person, Captain" says you?
I know it makes for a better story, Ishmael, but that's not a whale.
Ay Matey...He's taking a HAIR of the CAT that bit HIM.
He said a parrot didn't go with his look.
He calls it his comfort animal.
Only matter of time when he begins walking around here with that cat sitting on his shoulder...
Abe's right. This deck is way too neat for a pirate ship.
Someone should tell him that Peg Leg sounds more pirate-y than Cat Dad.
He used to be a tuna boat captain.
The parrot, the eye-patch, the swashbuckling hat -- Marketing said it all had to go. But the captain drew the line at the wooden leg. He was too attached.
The honeymoon will be over once it scratches him.
The cap'n seemed to lose interest when we installed GPS.
If that's a parrot then I'm a ballerina!
"I warned him he'd have trouble filling his days if he took the redundancy package ".
Call me Ishma..a..choo! Sorry, allergies.
I wouldn't wanna be around when Polly finds out.
I’m thinking the cap’n is a little OCD about white creatures.
Aye, me boyo, he's holdin' pussy, but he's thinkin' Dick.
Mr. Darwin says it is a form of mutualism.
No, it's like Cap'n told ye. Mr. Parrot's on a nice island playing with lots o' other friendly parrots.
Trust me, matey, it's better than havin' a Cap'n what's obsessed with a giant whale.
Crew for me he says. Pussy on every port he says.
He's obsessed with alliteratives. Maybe a 'captain's cat will pacify him.
Still nothing. Let's give him a dog next and see if he finally moves.
Ever since the parrot died he's been trying to get it to sit on his shoulder.
He's one of them "fightin' Irish". Better leave him be.
It's a therapy animal.
Shiver me timbers, I tawt I taw a puddy tat.
Carl didn't fit the pirating standard.
Ay, that Seadog has a leg to stand on when it comes to rearing them felines. They're good luck you know. 'Cept when they're not.
I miss the white whale..
I've never known a man so obsessed with an animal.
He's the cats favorite scratching post.
The Cat ate his parrot.
He's been ever so much calmer since he had the hook replaced with the cat, but no one has seen the parrot since!
His ex kept the booty and he got the cat.
Captain Hook's pre-morbid symptoms of male spinster syndrome. It starts with just one.
Leprechaun or pirate, he needs to commit.
If only my parrot had nine lives.
Does your stowaway policy mention animals?
He really has the traits to be president some day.
His name is Trump.
Don't worry, you'll still have eight left.
Four years crisscrossing the Pacific and he settles for a white cat.
Capn' Lucky!....tell that to the parrot
Fine, let him keep it. I'm not going to be the one stuck taking care of it though...
The guy smells like old money..
He woke up grouchy, but now he's in a good mewd
He's a changed man since the OCD meds
He says he just isn't a "parrot guy".
They let you do it when you're a star.
Worse yet. He's signed a tell-all book deal to benefit Greenpeace.
It's a hard life out here, but she'll always have a scratching post with him.
He just walked up and grabbed my pussy!
He thinks he can scare us with that cat-o-one tail.
I have an idea for the man and cat overboard drill.
See, nothing makes you forget missing legs and Great White Whale-hunting - like a Happy Birthday kitten from the crew...
He's got upurrrr management written all over him.
I hear that the cat is going to be the bait
I'm sorry Bill, you're a hot mess.
He hasn't put that cat down since he set foot on the ship.
Cute kitty, but we're running low on jerky.
He calls it "the great white kitty."
It's the only thing that keeps his mind off the whale.
Seems like a contented guy. Is he always that affectionate with animals?
Times are changing on us, is a metro-pirate still a pirate?
I'm more of a dog person
He calls this one Ishmael.
I told you guys the captain gets to eat the cat first.
I'm tell 'ya, there just ain't somethin' right about that new captain.
I'll try it, but I don't think much of 'scurvy cat' as an insult.
It's our decoy.
He got to bring a cat? All I got to bring was syphilis.
He's the entertainment?!
She's only after him for his scratching post.
He's never been the same since the Sea Shepherd incident.
Softer side my ass; it's whale bait.
Anything I say would be considered dirty.
At best he's a minor character.
Honestly, I don't know which one he is more obsessed with.
They must have focus-grouped the ending.
He catches the mice for her
Call me Snowflake
Ahab says if you are a celebrity, you can grab any pussy you want.
Arghhh....she's only with him for his scratching post.
I'm allergic too, but it's his Therapy Cat...
If we really want his blessing NOW might be a good time to ask.
Self-navigation has unmanned the captain.
Says her name is Peg.
We're gonna need a bigger cat.
They say cats have 9 lives, let's test theory at sundown.
I'm not fooled by his latest pivot.
It's only the white ones he keeps fixin' on, mate
Before we sailed, I never understood what he meant when he said "I working on a pet theory."
He's thinking of using live bait.
At the very least we should keep the cat so it can deal with the mouse problem.
I like him. He took my trousers up an inch.
I miss the mouse stew.
It's a cat-o-one tail
Don't tell Herman.
Some call the white cat Moby. And is he ever a dick.
So my editor says, "Ishmael, use your imagination."
I'm glad he got over the whale.
You can tell the tale of Moby Kitten, but I ain't.
Wait 'til Cap'n Rusty Scuffer finds out Fluffy ate our treasure map. Then, we'll see who'll be eatin' tender vittles by moonlight.
That cat! It's crazy about whale bone.
It's not fair! We should all get some cuddle time with kitty!
Matey just worships his new fur baby - and the cat gets a great scratching post.
Aye, matey... and have ye not heard of Maggy Dick, the Great White Cat?
Another wife successfully lost at sea.
So, Herman, how does great white cat fit into your story?
She's Peg the Fifth
The cat? The whale? No wonder there's no diversity on this crew.
That cat killed the mice and the roaches, what are we going to race now?
He needs another ball of yarrrrrrn
Kitty, the secret is just between us.
He keeps mumbling, "What's the best Tuna, Chicken of the sea" !
He just hasn't been himself since he got a companion animal.
We have to get past Abraham Lincoln first...
Why can't he just share his money, now that he is with us?
Look what the cat dragged in.
That's Dan. Says a pirate ship's better than America.
It seems that both of them have seven lives left!
After we have him walk the plank, that cat can get rid of our mice.
Yesterday it was the white whale, today it's tuna!
I didn't want to be first mate anyway.
His recruitment poster said, "Hunt the Great White." How were we to know he meant Mouse!
He better watch his other leg with this one.
I don't know how much longer we can distract him with a white cat.
He says the cat keeps his timber from shivering....
His leg makes a great scratching post.
He says that for the rest of the trip we have to use a cat-o-eight tails.
We were supposed to get a parrot.
Your cat, Mr. Johnson! I thought he was a goner!
My parrot now only purrs and meows.
Raid for Zyrtec at the next port?
Well, after all, he does have a built-in scratching post.
That’s his Happy Place.
The peg leg got him the job; the cat almost lost it for him.
At least his next obsession will be easier to find.
Turns out he was more of a cat person.
He settled for a white cat.
Isn't that the captain's chair?
Nope, he hasn't mentioned the white whale even once since we gave him the cat.
There's something a wee bit fishy going on between those two if you ask me.
The more often he scratches her neck, the less she sharpens her claws on his leg.
Aye, let the shark bite it clean off so Whiskers could have a scratching post.
one day a giant white whale, the next a fleabitten tabby. what say ye, ishmael...is monomania not a fickle mistress?
The new guy? Name's Blofeld.
He's a lot nicer with this new obsession
I don't know, but he is a man with a cat.
He's decided to start small and build up to a whale.
I liked Ahab better when he had that other obsession.
The madness has gone, aye, but as to Ishmael's promise of improved cardiovascular wellness, it does seem a mite fanciful.
...best cat owner ever, he even has a built-in scratching post.
The ships doctor sent him for a CAT scan
There’s no way he’ll win Pennsylvania.
Fishing for compliments is hard when you have two guys doing it for you.
I was the object of her affection until Senor Scratching Post came aboard.
"You should see him without his emotional support animal.
I guess the cat's out of the bag.
He had the cat declawed because of his leg.
Why can't we all have a kitty?
He had a parrot until the cat ate it.
He's dreaming up a four-hundred page children's book about that damn white cat.
Aye, that's how 'e used to hold that 'ol white whale, and where did that get 'em?
He may look presidential, but even grabbing a pussy can't hide that peg leg of his.
Seems he finally learned to shift his concept of attainable felicity.
If he was good he'd have died young.
There is no way it's a Siamese.
It's symbiosis. He likes the cat, the cat likes the scratching post.
Didn't he see the memo? One of the new guys is allergic.
It's their first cruise. Give 'em a few years, she'll be at his throat.
How much is that kitty in the window? The one with the waggly tail...
I don't think he knows it ate that parrot.
He's the biggest leprechaun I've ever seen.
Huh, I had him pegged for a dog lover.
captain trump is at it again
I new we were threw pirating when he said wipe your feet before you come aboard.
I haven't had any fun since that therapy cat showed up.
Look at that pussy over there ... I mean the cat!
It started when he discovered YouTube...
I hear he's allergic to parrots
He thinks that peg-leg of his allows him to do anything he wants during reenactments.
I've got to get upgraded next time. They will let anyone travel coach these days.
First it was whales. Now it's rats.
A whale didn't bite off Ahab's leg--the crazy fool had it made into a scratching post.
His leg doesn't smell so bad since he swapped the dog for a cat.
His cat has only one tail
I think your heartburn's getting worse
Love is love is love.
If that's what retirement looks like, forget it!
It's symbiotic. She scratches his stump.
There's no story in an obsession with a Great White cat, but . . .
The lepre-conned our Captain into thinking he and the cat bring good luck
No fair, he has his own scratching post.
He didn't even know who Moby Dick was until Puddles came on board,
Nobody even notices his leg anymore.
Rumor has it the Executive Health Insurance Plan also includes six weeks of 'rage reduction therapy' without any deductible.
He thinks he's being presidential.
I think we'd better keep this to ourselves.
Let's throw the dumb cat overboard and tell him that white whale ate it.
Umm, I never saw him as a cat person
Best whale bait there is.
Just our luck, we raid a ship with an oversized, emotionally needy, one-legged lepricon.
A therapy dolphin would have helped his career
He really is a "Dick" head!
I don't know what to think about that Schrodinger.
Any luck finding Captain's parrot?
Just when you think you're special he turns you into bait.
I don't know, they both look good.
He calls him Mobycat...
When Captain said "find the rat", do you think he meant figuratively or literally?
If you ask me, he's got an albino fetish.
If only he would stop grabbing it
It's kind of ironic, wouldn't you say, that he's wail and blubber with the white whale but wussy with that white pussy.
Cap'n says he now identifies as a gentleman.
He scratches the cat's back and the cat scratches his leg. It just works.
She used to be my cat, but I couldn't compete with someone who has a scratching post for a leg.
A rare combination, great ship's physician and a mobile scratching post.
But he KNOWS the captain has allergies...
Well, that explains the hair covering Ahab's peg leg.
So that's what he meant by grabbing pussy.
We've got to maroon him at the next rest stop.
I'll take the cat.
He said the passage was going to cost him an arm and a leg. I see he's only paid half.
Why is he playing with his pocket pussy
The rodent problem was never fixed.
It's been proven effective in treating O.C.D.
I miss my labradoodle.
He already ate the dog.
You ate the parrot, didn't you? You do know I have a sharp hook...
I tell ya, mate, those Emotional Support Animals are amazing!
First let him satisfy his curiosity by 'walking back the cat', and then we'll make him walk the plank......
He says he is a cartoonist with a caption block.
I suspected that Ishmael fella was a therapist
Well, so much for our double-rations of rum.
Damn it Ishmael! Just tell him about the whales!
Yep, that's Ahab. Since he got that kitty, he doesn't seem to chase whales.
The rodent problem was never fixed.
One word out of the cat and the parrot is back!
Melville got it wrong!
He named it, surprise, Moby Kit.
Comfort Pets ...what a scam.
That cat really loves the Old Salt.
I hear he's working with a therapist.
Wait'll it scratches his leg.
That leg used to be a lot thicker.
"He seems to love the new cat but why does he call her Bait"?
I hardly recognize him since he became a purrate.
He's sure now,with a familiar he can find where the leprechaun sank the pot of gold.
They say he lost his leg and his mind grabbing at pussies.
Air Force, obviously.
The captain's therapy cat has been an absolute godsend!
That demon whale sure buckled his swash.
What can I say.... but it's Pirates of the Caribbean, Part V.
Does the cat look familiar to you?
This "Pirates and Pilgrims" cruise is totally boring.
Aye,matey.It's his latest obsession.His great white cat.
Honest Abe's kind of a strange name for a pirate if you ask me, but the cat seems to like him!
Captain Ahab finally got the Great White Cat.
Cats think the Ahab walks around on a scratching post.
Ahabitual is what he be now.
I think he's gone soft on mammals.
YOU tell him it's not a catfish.
Aye, since he's rescued that cat...he's forgotten all about that whale thing
Looks like we'll need smaller harpoons.
I told him to bring the cat o" nine tails.
Now I know how Peggy the cat got her name
That's one lucky cat...constant petting and a scratching post all-in-one.
He can have it on board. It's a service cat.
Just keep him on his meds, we'll be fine.
You reckon cats can swim?
It's weird--he just keeps stroking the cat and muttering about its 'great, white tail.'
When he changed focus from the white whale to the white pussy, the film studio immediately lost interest.
All in all, I preferred the albatross.
Great white tail. Cap'n's accent's a buggah.
I thought after the mutiny they would've made me captain, not the cat
Any other pest-control suggestions?
He keeps telling it about his leg, so the rats are running free.
He is promising her a very big -- huge -- fish for dinner.
The new wave of immeowgrants.
Who let Schrödinger on the boat?
He's allergic to whales.
Let's remember to count his fingers later.
Great! His meds are finally working.
Five will get you ten that as soon as he puts it down, it will go back to using his peg leg as a scratching post.
Shiver me timbers that purr is loud.
I thought it was degrading for Ahab but then I realized what they did to poor Starbuck's legacy.
Best served as meatballs.
They have been a couple ever since she scratched his peg.
I hear he named the cat Peggy after his leg.
She only loves him for his scratching post.
Aye, but the larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted.
SAVE THE WHALES: The moment when Ahab became an environmentalist
It's pussy before piracy.
He has a thing about white animals
He insists on calling him Abraham!
It's the latest hostility sublimation therapy.
Well, so much for your scratching post idea.
The cat needed a new scratching post and old peg leg didn't seem to mind.
He tried retiring to Florida, but piracy is all he knows.
When he said that he wanted to get on the pirate ship with a little pussy I thought that he meant something completely different.
...but the cat took his heart.
I prefer that one to the one with nine tails.
Our captain is a strange one, isn't he, Melville?
Pirating just ain't what it used to be.
Since when did cruises become a better haul than plunderin'?
We're gonna need a bigger cat.
I told you not to let him watch Finding Dory
Poor cap'n; still hears Polly's voice every time the cat purrs
All the Captain and the Catpain ever do is sit around on that five legged chair.
The captain isn't edgy anymore.
More like "fore score and nine lives ago."
Arrr, ya think it will taste like chicken?
As long as he has the cat, no walking the plank!
Call me Mr.Whiskers.
I'm surprised he still likes that thing after it used his leg as a scratching post.
He always struck me as more of a dog person.
Who's going to tell George the cat is dead?
The cat has really taken to him ever since he installed that scratching post.
Where did he get that hat?
I hear he cut off his own leg just for a scratchin' post.
We're on course for his pot of gold.
It is Captain Ahab in disguise with an emotional support cat. I'd know his peg leg anywhere.
I still cannot believe he made it first mate.
His 'world domination' routine is getting stale.
Just remember, the cat is Toby, not Moby!
Little do they know that I'm going to steal their treasure.
He was bumped from the the 'Mayflower'.
Well, at least he caught the Great White Rat.
I think that guy has lost it. He keeps talking about flowers in May.
Man, that Sarah McLachlan song really got to him
He belongs to the cat.
Ahoy vey, matey.
I'm telling you: Ahab didn't have a cat!
Treasure is in the aye of the beholder.
They have a lot in common. The cat likes fish as food and the man's soon going overboard and will be fish food.
Another one of history's might-have-beens !
I don't care if the cat isn't a licenced therapy pet, the old man is different without him.
It's his first LARP. That's not even a real peg leg, it's a scratching post.
They brought the mail.
The captain said to grab him by the pussy...
Okay fine. It's cute. But I'll never forgive that thing for what it did to my Polly.
I think he's lost his mojo.
It just seems like there was a more obvious name than Moby Feline.
If not for the damned scratching post, Fluffy would have nothing to do with him.
Sure, the boss is more empathetic, but I'm the one swabbing the poop deck.
His therapy cat has really gotten him out of the mood of pillaging.
Maybe they'd leave us alone if we flew the skull and crossbones instead of the Confederate flag.
It's the new policy from Human Resources
Supposedly he lost it to a cannonball, but I think he had it cut off to install the scratching post.
They say he's obsessed.
She scratches his leg, he scratches hers.
He thinks he's Donald Trump.
He likes the cat, the cat likes him, and we are on a boat.
Sure looks like Ahab !!
When voting for our captain, I guess we should have went by the way he was dressed as opposed to how many legs he has.
Claws or no claws, he's the saltiest one on this ship.
Who is that Kerouac guy he keeps quoting?
I'm not saying they're not adorable! Im just saying I was thinking there was looting and booty to be had up here when you said 'The man holding the kitty is on the poop deck.'
Boy! this new captain looks like this voyage is going to be great for us crew members.
He's still completely unaware that his cat ate his parrot.
No longer hunting the Great White since he found the Little White.
The new hiring policy is hurting our reputation.
It's as close as he can get to his parrot.
Don't worry kitty, I would let you be their next meal.
First she took over the poop deck, and then, Captain Fluffy turned the old seadog's peg leg into a scratch post.
Captain and I have different ideas about retirement
He's held that cat all eight times he's walked the plank.
He may look innocent, but don't mess with Johnny one-leg!
Ain't no gettin' rid o' these strays...long as Captain's got a scratchin' post for a leg.
So far, it hasn't exactly lived up to its 'epic saga of a one-legged fanatic' billing.
Well, will you look at those two ... Guess we know what happened to the Captain's parrot!
I can't believe the captain gave up his pirate outfit and parrot all for a pussy.
Just wait till he finds out he ate the parrot!
It's the only thing that stops his blubbering rage....
He's having trouble keeping parrots.
This is not a Trump joke titled "Moby Pussy."
He feeds it 'Ishmeal'.
Won't Dr Schrodinger be surprised that both of them are still alive!
First a Parrot on the shoulder. Now a cat. I suppose next it will be a dog at his foot.
I'm not sure if he's right for the job...
Anything white.
His leg doubles as a scratching post.
How can I say it so even you'll understand? He protects that cat, that eats the mice, that would eat the food, that feeds the crew, including you.
Once a pirate, always a pirate.
Ah, the pussy always works.
We've had a major rat problem so the Captain thought this dude might solve it.
Lucky for us, he transferred his obsession to the Great White Mouse.
My travel agent specifically told absolutely "No Pets
I don't mind the cat, but I hate the litter box.
He doesn't have any idea how the parrot disappeared.
Beware - 'tis the Small White Cat
He completely mellowed after he exchanged a caw for a purr.
This explains your heartburn
He just picked up the white cat, sat down and said that give me an idea for a novel.
well, he used to tend bar in Portland. but he realized that if he was ever going to write his novel he'd need something to write about. so, here he is.
He be kitten us.
You can't deny it, what he lacks in legs he makes up in style.
He thinks he's coming to term with the reincarnation of Moby Dick.
This doesn't bode well for getting his whale.
Aye mate, it's just Ahab it of the captain's
He is seeking an inner peace.
That's five scratching post legs I've had to carve this trip
If you distract him, I'll grab his pussy.
I'm starting to think the captain's gone soft.
What incentive can we give a cat to get on another ship?
It's the peg leg. He says you can grab them anywhere.
Why would his cat cause every rat to abandon the ship?
Whale smells a lot like tuna.
He's never gonna get that cat in his carry on bag.
Aye, chased him 'round the house, 'round the neighbor's mailbox and 'round Perdition's flames 'afore he caught him
I just told him the cat had shred a white veil to pieces
He's been this way ever since he started getting mail from AARP.
With a skill like that, he could be president some day.
He's an aristocat!
Sure, they seem to be in love, but I still think it's an abnormal relationship.
Aye! Let's go with the 'cat overboard' plan. Meet in the galley at twilight for a roast.
Does this mean we can go home early ?
Since his parrot disappeared, the Captain and the cat are inseperable..arrrghh!
I could just watch cats all day.
He's implying it because our mutiny failed.
I guess if Trump can have any pussy he wants, so can he.
I still think Meowby Dick is an odd name for a cat.
I prefer the Cat-O-Nine-Tails.
He's a whale of a cat lover!
I guess it's because his leg is also a scratching post.
Have you told him about the Captain's no pets rule.
They're drawn by their mutual distrust of water.
Cap'n swore that sabbatical wouldn't change him.
Ever since he got the white kitty he's lost interest in the white whale.
Just wait til that cat needs a scratching post!
Nothing has been the same since he started reading.
He just doesn't seem to get it.
Haven't heard as much about that white whale recently.
Nothing smells fishy anymore.
I don't like that he calls her Matey.
How many more of his limbs to we have to eat before we can go after the cat?
It IS Schroedinger's cat!
So wait, the cat's name is Ishmael?
He swears he can teach it to talk.
Me thinks the captain has taken one of those serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
He prefers a cat now because his dog always tried to fetch his leg.
I'm so appalled I even miss the rats.
Finally, a new obsession.
I told you we shouldn't have let him watch 'From Russia with Love!'
Not only that he let's her use his leg as a scratching post.
Aye, but it's nae love , matey. Cap'n is but a glorified scratchin post he'll find soon enough.
She got the dog.
We say 'Aye Vey!' on this here Long John Silverman's ship. And he don't stand for no chatty parrots.
Consequence, pain or reward; what's he going through over there?!
He still talks like a pirate.
The steel balls lost favor.
I forget…do we call him a “cat lover” or a “cat lubber”?
O.K. kitty. You killed all the rats on deck, now go get those dogs.
Captain says its Queequeg's turn t' swab th' litter box. Ye tell 'im!
Is he up to something, again?
So many feels.
They sure don't write storybooks like they used to.
I'm tired of him rubbing his pussy.
Yea, a democrat for sure.
Ishmael, I'm telling you the Captain's cracking up. He says the cat keeps his mind off that big white whale that's been following us around.
We call him Captain A because of what he uses for whale bait.
He's really not handling his retirement very well
Wouldn't be countin' on booty, Rudy
Cap'n says call it compromise
He's never been the same since the white whale."
Well, he'd love me too if I had a built in scratching post.
That cat will take your leg off when he's angry.
Just wait -- we're gonna regret serving under this pussy-grabber
She is his lucky charm. But he is magically delicious.
He is obsessed with catching a mouse.
So now he prefers meowing to whaling!!
He calls it "Catship" then laughs. I don't get it.
What do you say we make Honest Abe walk the plank and we put the cat back in the bag?
A kinder, gentler pirate? Now there's an oxymoron.
Rumor is he faked his own death.
It must have been the mushrooms in his stew.
How much more Xanax did you say we had?
It's not about the whale.
I'm drawing a real plank with this one.
The old man has begun talking about soft power.
Aaargh! On this ship, anything goes.
I mean it is the only Pussy on board
Pet first, then keelhaul him!
Should we call him Abe now?
He's turned all squishy since the cat showed up.
Apparently men inpower can just grab 'em.
Yep we are deporting another Pilgrim who came into the Colonies without a green card and was taking jobs away from Native Americans.
What about our needs?
Word has it we have to pay him a pension, too.
Fake beard or not, no way she gets the Captain Hook role without having shown her pussy.
A scratch post & a lap. Lucky cat.
Let's go find me pot o'gold! Let's go find me pot o'gold!" If that rainbow don't show up today, I say "Let's throw his ass overboard!
I miss the parrot, but not the stain down his back.
Shall we go for a catwalk?
Old Moby Dick'd shed a tear if he could see Ahab during quiet time.
Who let the cat out of the bag?
Well, if I had a scratch post for a leg Mittens would like me, too!
The cat gives him comfort and he gives the cat a scratching post!
He thought when we sail the ocean blue we would have a beauty of a saucer for his cat
You wouldn't believe the alternative facts I've heard about Rev. Silver.
Hey look! It's the Statue of Liberty.
'The captain's mood sure has improved since we brought aboard Mew-by Dick!'
Is that the RAT exterminater ???
Crazy cat matey...
I miss life before Mr. Snuggles.
I'd like to see whether that cat can swim!
I thought the thing with the parrot was weird and now this.
He has the idea that the right kind of white cat can catch a white whale.
"Call him Ishmael," he says. So much for my book.
Where does our ole Captain think he is-on a love boat cruise?
Bidding one last farewell to the bait of that shark he desperately wants to take home.
Captain Pussy over there prefers cats to tats.
Arrr if you think it's so easy why don't it be YOU who grabs him by the pussy.
And I hear they have a huge litter box called Rockaway Beach.
Well, he's a kind of white supremacist, really.
Who'd have guessed? Cat-lubber.
He's changed since catching The Great White Cat.
I never get to sit on his lap...
He must be deaf as he doesn't know meow from caw caw
Whale? What whale!?" says he, "Strike a course for the Canary Islands!
argh! I wish he didn't purgh so loudly
Aye, he finally found the great white cat. Can we go home now?
He's convinced that Sperm Whales have a taste for cats.
She just likes him for the scratch post.
Thar she meows!
I like cats too, but I'm not obsessed by them.
I liked it better when he just had the Queen balls.
The cat doesn't mind his wooden leg ... it was love at first scratch.
Blackbeard at Rest
The whale is next.
He's fancy for a pirate.
He's acting like such a dick about that cat...
Ten doubloons says he loses the hand by the end of the week.
And he said he was allergic...
He got old and soft -- won't steal anything but intellectual property.
Ah! We should have yelled 'Mutiny' when he got the cat.
Ahr...the 'Phurr of the Ancient Mariner'
Has he contributed to the voyage kitty yet?
I thought he ordered a parrot.
Of course the cat likes him the best he thinks it's a scratching post.
Scurvy??! He better worry about Cat Scratch Fever!
He pulled it out of the hat
I wish he showed us the same compassion.
He says it keeps the rats away.
Ever since Schrodinger come aboard, he don't even talk about the whale.
He calls it a pussyhat.
When did he change his obsession from a great white whale to a soft white kitty?
Yeah, ever since it used his leg as a scratching-post.
Ahab has not been himself since Captain Bligh got Moby Dick.
If we ate Captain's parrot, we'd walk the plank.
Have you seen anything of a white mouse?
Why is the Captain carrying around that cat? Remember how attached he was to his parrot Salty? And he said it was the only thing on this ship that he trusted? And that nothing will come between him and salty? Yea so! Well the cat ate the parrot!
hey bro
"They're waiting for Charlie the tuna".
I wonder... what would the cat man do?
He doesn't hate all white mammals.
Ol' Pegleg can dish out the scratching and he can take it, too.
Cap'n Ahab says his cat likes really big fish.
I wish we had a cat, the U.S. loves cats, now we'll never get in
It seems he's more interested in the pussy than captaining this ship.
He spends a ton on peg legs.
I heard he's fucking the cat.
They just let Ahab out of rehab.
Ever since the pussy, not a word about Dick.
That's what he said. "Water for my horses, whiskey for my men, pussy for me."
He's promising her a really big fish
His last cat took his leg.
It's all cute and fun until he makes you walk the plank for not cleaning the litter box.
"A little pussy takes his mind off whales. '
Damned cat turned him into a pussy.
We can't let Ishmael find out about this.
Those PETA people don't mess around.
He keeps promisin' her the gizzards of a pertickular varmint he's allus goin' on about.
Captain Ahab he ain’t.
We's tried to corner it last night. The little rascal's got scabbards, I tell ye!
He's dreaming of the day Princess Precious Puss rips Moby a new one.
He's just not the same since he caught up with Moby Kitt.
Who do we choose to walk the plank, the Abraham Lincoln look alike or that obnoxiously cute cat?
Ugh, Vegans.
You know, I'm actually starting to miss that damned parrot.
Am I doing what Trump said he could?
Finally no rats, but you hate fish.
I say let him stay. The captain's been cross what with being the only scratching post on this ship.
he's a mouseketeer privateer with a brogue purr
We never should have found the great white man!
That cat's as relaxed as a one-legged man on a pirate ship.
I was there when she dragged him in.
Prrrrrrr, Matey!!!
why don’t you pet me like that??
Aye, but she'll be shark bait when she whittles away the leg.
He wouldn't throw it back.
Sure, the cat prefers him. His leg's a scratching post.
Thar be one whale of a cat.
Now that he's trimmed his beard, he goes by 'Mr. Teach.'
It's done wonders for his grooming.
Shark got the leg...
Can I borrow just one more life? Lets make it for an arm this time.
The captain may be tough, but never once take your eye off that cat...
My Mr. Meowsers thinks he's people.
He settled for two out of three, white and great.
I like the cheap seats.
That's great, but he doesn't have to clean up the hairballs.
the cat's not real, he just takes it with him so he won't get lonely
If we don't make Abe walk the plank soon, the rats will eat all our food.
Polly and Mrs. Whiskers are now one and the same.
He keeps asking about tonight's floor show.
There's a big difference between "feline touch" and "female touch."
God, how I wish he would just stick to cats.
Sure, it's all hugs and purrs now. Wait 'til he finds out his beloved parrot is 'missing.'
I don't know who he is, but he says his name is Bill O'Reilly?
First it was scurvy, now it's cat scratch fever.
The white whale was too elusive. He settled on white cat.
So much for his short-term memory.
Says his name is Seuss and he is some kind of a doctor.
He says I scratched the deck, but you know I only use microfiber on that finish.
When he gets through with Moby Cat, watch out.
Captain says diversity will make us stronger.
A fat cat petting a fat cat. I hate white collar pirates.
....and then you string the rope through those portholes, to use like a garrote!
I call it a 'cute-iny'.
Cap'n needs yar'n.
"Abe brought lunch".
Do you think he realizes Mittens isn't the only one who likes a belly rub around here?
Just call it Moby for the time being.
His last pet was a white whale and how did that go?
Don't worry Honey, you will be having a nice big fish for dinner.....
Aye, he just grabbed me pussy and said, "I'm da Captain now.
As usual Mr. Phelps, your lab results will self destruct in five seconds.
He says the ambiance is OK, but he misses the shuffleboard.
He definitely got pussy in town
That cat might make a nice dinner.
There'll be hairballs in the blowholes tonight.
I mean, what kind of self-respecting Pirate has a cat?
No, that is Ernst Blofield in mufti- obviously he's not Goldfinger!
He is looking for a purrfect union.
I preferred it when he was feisty.
Wasn't he on about a great white whale?
His thinks he's Dr. Seuss.
Who knew he was a cat person?
No, I have no idea why he named her Margaret.
If only we had known earlier . . .
We're hoping he begins to like white animals.
Call me Annoyed.
Ahab forgives the cat for eating his parrot, but I slip up ONCE with the harpoon…
Thanks to his animal-assisted therapy, our Captain has decided to change the name of the ship to 'The Muffin'
A peg legged cat person. Just our luck.
That monster's allergic to cats, so he's safe for now. Only took his leg last time.
How'd that nerd wind up with the only pussy on the boat?
Not only does thats wooden stump serve as a leg, it's also a mobile scratching post for his cat.
My plan is working. I will finally be able to get rid of this hanky-hat.
Me? I thought he was with you.
He's forgotten about Moby since he got that white cat.
You very well know that I love cats, but having them aboard doesn't necessarily help the whole scary pirate thing.
Pfft...She's only using him for his scratching post.
I think the cat at the parrot.
Have you noticed the captain has been acting a bit strange lately?
At least it buries its treasures.
It will be dark soon.
Mhhmm this cat is my only friend on this boat. I don't need the others
Rats desert the ship and Cap'n thanks the cat.
The cat ate his albatross.
His mother always thought he should be a small animal vet.
The whale got Ahab's leg, but the cat got the whale's tongue.
I think it's Billy Bush.
Fuck that cat and the peg-legged leprechaun it road in on.
Rumor has it they're on this ship to escape political purrrsecution.
I'm not going to tell him he sprayed on the new carpet "runner".
Does the pirate trans-Atlantic cruise every year. Made his money inventing potato flakes.
He decided it was time to downsize.
I'm trying to keep him calm. Once he sees our cargo, he's gonna flip.
'Thank God,his obsession is now with the cat,not with you know who!"
Management thought that having a cat on board would make us seem more enterprise...
Oh sure, it's all well and good for him, but I don't like my leg being used as a scratching post.
The doctor's hopin' that Ahab's new white therapy cat will keep him calm on this voyage.
And his stump comes in handy as a cat scratcher.
Glad he likes scratching cats instead of swinging them
White whale? White cat? You can still call me Ishmael.
When Polly left him, I think he realized he needed to confront his past.
Nothin sadder than a peg-legged cat person.
Don't even think of disturbing him during cat lap time.
I guess he's found a new passion in life.
Frank just came aboard... Pet therapy I tell ya
He's the new scratching post for the ship's cat.
His cat's getting tired of tuna!
I have no idea where Cats' Cove is.
Wooden leg or scratching post?
He named it Moby Purr.
He says he's trying to find himself ever since the peg leg.
For some reason, he calls her Kellyanne.
I'd rather walk the plank.
Pray it doesn't scratch him.
It's great duty if you like cats and hate the hokey pokey.
Now I won't need that tiny little harpoon to hunt the great White Mouse.
This is not what I signed up for.
Beats the dang parrot!
' Thar she purrs ' is Ahab's new motto.
That's Old Peg Leg's brother, Scratching Post.
Remember when he used to let us lick his hand?
"'Well he's got the peg leg, but I've never known a cat person yo be a good pirate".
I thought the Captain was joking when he said "call me President Lincoln", but now that the parrot is gone...
He's got this thing for white.
I have misunderstood him all these years.
Since the leg incident, I thought there's no more naked lap time.
We're hoping Kitty Dick gets his mind off that whale.

I miss the good old days of yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
He claims to be a populist, but all I see is pandering to special interests.
That cat really bit him years ago and he hasn't forgotten it.
The Dutchman put catnip on his wooden leg and now she's his true love.
Aye, the Great White Cat beckons.....
I'm done feeling sorry for him, he's had his share of the kitty.
It's OK, I checked; he brought a letter along for an emotional support animal
If that's Long John Silver I'll eat his hat.
I don't know about you, but the dreaded pirate Blackbeard and Mr. Whiskers doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.
I wouldn't do it, Matey. You'll never get into politics if you keep grabbing their pussies.
We're out of water. Whats the cat gonna do for us?
I guess he's attending Pirates Anonymous now. The cat's his transitional object.
I knew things would change under the new CEO. But rebranding into a tuna boat?
It's touching to see how he has learned to forgive.
I think our captain now has different priorities
If he names it Ishmael, I'm outta here.
Instead of giving Polly a cracker, he gave Polly to the cat.
Your the only cat I sea.

I think he's got this thing about a large albino mouse too?
It's called a cat o' nine tails minus eight.
Ok, the cat therapy makes the Capitan FEEL better - but it doesn't catch a Great White Whale!
Wuh?
Wouldn't be countin' on booty, Rudy
I think old peg leg has gone soft on us.
Whale off, therapy cat on.
People can really change on these long voyages. Fred used to be a dog person.
What happened to the parrot?
I don't see how an emotional support cat is going to help him with his larger problem.
The cat's name is Margaret, never call it by it's nickname.
Turns out he was ready to retire.
Aye matey! There'll be no more blather about "pieces of eight" now, will there?

He heard the cat go "mee-aargh" and it was all over.
According to the Captain, it's a Lowell cat.
Pray this bloke doesn't face rough seas. It's one thing to stroke your favorite pussy. It's another to deal with all those hair balls....

No, YOU tell him whales aren't actually fish!
If you find his cat obsession creepy, wait until he starts going on about the whale.

Not sure if Ahab there got the idea from 'The Godfather' or Dr. Evil.
I'm going to keel haul the captain's Secret Santa.
He used to touch me like that. "Let's have a cat together," he says. "It will make us even closer." I carried that scratchy cat embryo in my abdominal cavity for months and this is the thanks I get. Feel goddamn invisible sometimes.
Peg doesn't know Planky likes to scent the wood.
Big deal. It'll just wait till he's dead, and eat him then.

He was sick and tired of his nagging parrot.
One of these days she'll take his other leg.
You want to tell him that Ishmael named the cat 'Moby Dick'?
Which 'whiskers' should we whisk into the water?

On the sea again.

Well I'm relieved,cats are good luck.
So what do you think? One plank or two?
Well la-di-da! Cap'n fancy-pants couldn't just get a scurvy dog like a regular bloke.
He lost his edge. Had to turn in his parrot.
Arrr, I reckon th' days o' soiled dress-blues, & squawkin' feathered mates be over.
I wish we had that many lives.
" Do you think he will feed the cat to the whale"?
He got the emotional support animal after his parrot was mysteriously eaten.
He emancipated cats but lost his leg to a shark
Can you believe it, he made his cat first mate!
You tell her. Last time I gave Polly bad news she pecked my eye out
What makes this voyage unbearable is being forced to quickly repeat, "Kitty caught the kitten in the kitchen," every bloody hour!
Seems like the Cap'n's pet therapy is working.
He got the idea from the James Bond films.
Who's going to tell him this isn't a pet-friendly cruise?
Ay, he's playin' a dev'ous cat-and-whale game.
That's the cat whose got your tongue, matey.
Aye matey, he's looking aye and matey today.
Good disguise but the peg leg gives it away.
Have you seen the Captain's parrot-trans-species cat?
It's time to drop him off when we get to Florida.
It's a mewtiny.
Behind his back we call him "Scratchpost Pete."
He keeps promising that damn cat whale meat before the trip is over.
I hope that scratching post comes soon, or this could get ugly.
Cap'n says 'e won't hurt a flea—like that's good?
The cat is always loved until the treasure comes.
Nine lives? The bird's not coming back any time soon.
Aye mate , once we get Wi Fi we may be able to pet the cat.
He gets along fine with small mammals.
He's not been thinking right since he got cat scratch fever and also lost his leg.
Big fish my ass!
"That's one whale of a white cat tale".
Watch this, 'Pieces of Ate' detests being stroked.
I heard they eat cats. I hear things.
And he has this strange habit of scratching his leg.
Who ever heard of a scallymeow?
Aye, the bilge rats are hiding somewhere!
Did he get board approval for that cat?
Not a legit emotional support animal, if you ask me...
Methinks he's lost that je-ne-sais-quoi.
Idiot! You shanghaied a SNUGGLER!
When Ahab said he was after a great white "whale", he never meant it to be taken literally.
They don't call him Captain Scratchin' Post for nothing.
If he doesn't start cleaning up after it we'll have to send him to the poop deck.
Ahab became obsessed with the cat that had a big white tail.
It doesn't look like an albatross
He's been a love since I put catnip in his ale.
This takes scratching post to a new level.
It's confirmed...you are a hunk of burning love.
Did you see her whip that whale!!!!!!!
Now we need a litter box on the poop deck.
That's our new pro bono union rep. She's negotiating grog rations with O'Reilley.
I don't see why we just can't set mousetraps.
He would pet the cat with two hands if he didn't have a peg arm.
It's called the Pegleg Purr.
Look what the cat dragged in this time.
He's completely obsessed with that white cat.
Well, at least we know now that he's not a colorist.
Abraham Lincoln stroking his cat, Booth, on his final voyage at sea.
I'm not sure which one is keeping down the rat population.
Captain ain't been the same since we swapped scrimshaw for a bag of mushrooms.
We all have to scrub the decks while he got theater tickets. It's not fair.
He also has a rainbow closet.
Ever seen a flying cat? Yell, "Thar she blows!"
It's an improvement, I guess, but still a damned metaphor.
He finally found the white cat.
Yes he seems sane right now but wait till he spies the white whale.
How'd he get so lucky?
Say what you will, the anti-depressives have worked wonders.
White is not his color.
His first pet was a beaver.
He says she takes his mind off revenge.
You tell him we are out of cat litter.
Mom's gonna hear about this pussy.
All things white are drawn to him.
I hope it scratches his eye out.
So much for the entree... .
Better than having babies on deck.
billy budd has really worked wonders on claggart in this dimension
He prefers the cat-o'-one tail.....
I really feel for him, but I just get so uncomfortable around peg legs.
Har! Ahab was obsessed in finding the white cat!
He's all about whiskers these days.
I never expected a happy ending.
Start small, I say'd.
Someone's got a new obsession.
The cat thinks he smells like 'Fishmeal'.
Rats! I prefer quinine!
He went from looking for whales to looking for pussy.
It's fine now! Just wait until she stats using his leg as a scratching post!
I don't want to be the one to tell him the Nostalgia Cruise sailed last week.
I am not sure Pirate Uber will be very successful.
They both needed something to scratch.
I don't have anything to say that is politically correct.
Arr. Shiver me timbers; me've been catfished again!
Rumor is he's the Captains brother in law.
Our lame duck captain, with a cat as an advisor
The captain's epaulets are much cleaner since Mister Mittens came aboard.
now who's leaving this sinking ship ?
Behind the bow, a pinch of catnip, a scratching post, and thou at my lap purring on the briny.
Between you and me...
I told him this wasn't the A train.
At least he won't be using the one with nine tails on you!
His cat really likes fish!
Dr. No? More like Dr. Aye.
He thinks Moby Dick was re-incarnated>
Maybe you better tell the caption Mr.Lincoln's cat just ate his pet parrot.
Not my president!
Aye, there's a new first mate on board.
'THE CAPTAIN SPENDS MORE TIME WITH HIS CAT THAN WITH US."
' He pretends he's on the Q E 2'
Yeah, I know: Abe Lincoln holding a cat. I'm layin' off the rum.
You'd think he's on a whale spotting tour.
Not only that, he posts cat videos!
Man, I wish I could get some pussy.
A show to placate animal rightists. What is their problem with whaling? For the first time in history, the industry has made America great!
The cat likes him 'cause he smells like tuna.
As long as you tie the knots right, they let you wear anything you like.
Now it's all about the white kitty.
No mistake, matey, the cursed White Rodent, him that gnawed the pegleg, has felt the mouser's claw!
Don't fret, my kitty. They just told me the travel ban doesn't apply to pets.
Well, you're married to the sea.
He knows where our booty is.
Ahab? Nah, he's A wuss.
You tell him. We may need his cat since meals are not served on this 'cruise'.
I once saw him and that cat share a fish "Lady and the Tramp" style. It was disgusting.
I thought he was totally legless when he came aboard.
I like cats! They taste like chicken.
What he really wants is 50 tons of cat food!
He knows my love language is touch.
Who's that peg-legged man with the captain?
He poops on the deck and still gets treated better than us.
Aye matey, cook’s looking high and mighty today.
Arrr, that cat would be lovin' me if I had a built in scratchin' post.
If there's any more snuggling, Mr. Whiskers will be walking the plank.
He's going to make you an offer you can't refuse.
Don't worry, you still have a ninth life....
Exactly who told him that the cat was a whale spotter?
He hates dogs.
That cat has its own scratching post.
He seems too mellow to have ever been one of us.
Who knew that Blackbeard was such a cat person?
What's a pilgrim?
So it's 2 syllables and is something to do with my tonsils
After so many years of hard living and fighting, it's wonderful to see that Roger has exercised his disability, 401K, and company pension--life is smooth sailing for him now.
He's totally lost it. That cat could take off his other leg in a New York minute.
Captain Ahab calls it 'Moby Cat'
Pet lover, nothing! That's his lunch.
Ay, dress for the job ye want, not the job ye have.
He thought the parrot was too nice.
Dump him overboard. He can't seem to get the Arr in Arrrgh.....
I used to be his favorite.
That cat has had us chasing after bigger and bigger fish. Where will it end?
He was a great Pirate in his day
He put his foot down once too often.
The cat walks the plank. He ate the parrot.
He heard there might be pirats on his ship.
Pip gave it to him. He was missing his pipe.
I really question the hat.
Since we had them both spayed, they've lost all interest in chasing down critters.
I knew that cat would be distracting… We are way off course!
Looks like he finally found his white tail.
Uh-oh. That's eight. One more and he'll have his cat o' nine tails!
I'm out of here if he gets a pink flag next.
The orange cat, not so much.
Wonder why he took blubber off the menu
By golly that is Abe Lincoln. I guess his cat isn't the only one with nine lives.
That cat has the audacity to act all cute even after what it did to my parrot! Polly want no cracker no more!
I refuse to call it 'Mr. Cuddles.'
lucky the rats have left; he says he wants to free the ship's cat from slavery.
That explains the little presents in my sand sample's.
well at least the cat will be productive.
I say toss him overboard and keep the cat!
We're looking at our retirement plan.
Two can play at the walking scratch-post game.
I know, that parrot had a 'fowl' mouth
When he came out of his mid-life crisis, he self-identified as a pirate leprechaun veterinarian.
I'll distract him while you grab him by the pussy
Aye matey, tell the cap"n he is on board and take the catnip away.
Well THAT escalated quickly...
That's what happens when pirates go gluten-free vegetarian.
That's not a Kraken.
Sure, he lost a leg. But no self-respecting pirate cuddles a cat.
Even after she took his leg, he still loves that cat.
It looks like it's his lucky day!
I know, it's rigged... They always win at musical chairs!
Emotional support animals are so yesterday.
Captain or not I want my cat time!
They say he's gone soft ever since he started that fast food chain.
It's worse than we thought, his hashtag #sassycatsofthesea is trending.
Hates white whales - loves white cats.
Skipper's on the prowl again. This time it's Moby Mouse.
Yeah, well guess who has to change the box!
Maybe I better change my shirt.
He never liked that parrot anyway.
I sat mate, he's one step away from the Cuckoo's nest!
That be Long John Silverman and his precious Katz. No chatty Parrot for he.
I never heard of a therapy cat either, but it seems to work.
I could stand him naming her about anything...but Captain Kiddy just isn't right.
He seems less driven now that he's adopted what he calls his great white cat.
Cursed magic! I said 'I'll send you to home' not 'incendio tome'.
Did you hear our Cap'n is an un'dock'umented pirate?
His disability benefits ran out once we rounded the Cape.
He's go the easy job yes, but I'm not willing to get two peg legs to replace him.
That's odd... I had him pegged for a dog person.
The union negotiated him down to a cat o'one tail.
He's not saying "Bring me a bright nail"..
But how'll we know we're sinking?
Ever since he got that Moby Cat he's a changed person.
I think it is the start of a mewtiny!
He keeps mumbling over and over, 'port left, starboard right'.
I said "catapult" you cretin.
Aye, but if he keeps up all that belly-rubbin' in public, it's gonna ruin our sea cred.
He says that he's waiting for a Mr. Godot who should be along any minute now.
Cats taste better than parrots.
He is avoiding the cat walk
He eats pussy.
Ahab seems a lot more contented since he found Moby Pussy.
I heard he picked her up at Starbuck's.
I bet you the new guy is stealing all the treassure.
Even the first mate doesn't have as close a relationship with the Captain as Bos'n Snowball.
ya ask me, he went overboard to give that cat a scratching post.
His dad got the great white whale, all he’s got is an old white cat.
I'll admit, it's kinda fishy.
I think these 'therapy pet' qualifications are getting a little out of hand.
He's expecting a dead cat bounce.
He says his parachute set him down in that chair...whadya think?
he quit the pirate business and got a cat named peg.
That ain't how to 'give him a taste of the cat'.'
Now maybe he'll forget about that whale!
Wear a neck beard, walk the plank I say.
Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing.
I dunno, since that Greenpeace woman left er cat on board he ain't said word one bout no cursed Leviathan, nor any other creature above decks nor below!
mioum mioae mae
No, no. Starbuck is the first mate. Creame Latte is the cat.
His obsession with Moby Dick ended when Moby Pussy came aboard.
But why a white whale?
One of us has to tell Ahab that we found the cat’s owner.
It took ten years of therapy, anger management classes and hard work. But today Capt. Blackbeard is a happy and well-adjusted man.
I told you he has a feminine side.
Yeah, WE'RE supposed to call him "Ahab," but his friends call him "Ahab, the Cat Lady."
'Purina isn't good enough,' he says. 'She only eats white meat,' he says.
Shiver me timbers! I never heard of a "service cat" Yarrgh!
I think his travel agent really screwed up.
She can't do one of those lives twice, can she?
He hasn't been the same since he saw "The Godfather."
"The Great White Kitten" just doesn't carry the same weight with me.
He mumbled something about booking a singles cruise.......
He keeps repeating "somebody stole the strawberries", I dunno.
He's a lot more easygoing since he got that service cat.
Captain promised us Calico Jack - not a calico named Jack.
He thinks he's fooled us by calling it Polly.
A parrot? Victim of import controls.
How long do you think that cat will distract him from the termite outbreak onboard?
IF HE GOES BELOW, WE LOSE POWER.
How long will the cat keep him subdued?
That cat's way too cool for me.
Looks like they both been nippin'.
look what the cat caught on the poop deck.
We're not dockin' till he tells me what happened to my parrot.
If he wants to make that cat useful, he should put some cream on that tacky beard and let the cat lick it off.
The purring gives him a break from the inscrutable power of evil.
''That's the closet he has gotten in 40 years''
Mick hasn't been acting normal ever since he got that cat...
I would complain but I don't really have a leg to stand on
I don't think the whale will be satisfied with a cat.
Some think its Trump Derangement Syndrome, but I think he's terminally nuts.
Plunder's out. Petsitting is the new gold.
Well I guess you'll have to do since you ate my bird.
Does he think he's auditioning for Blackbeard, Lincoln or Dr. Evil?
Ahab seems to be better now.
Nice to see a man enjoying his First Class status.
The booty was the pussy?
There's just no panache, if you will, to 'The Great White Kitty'.
I hated him more when he was chasing after that damn whale.
The letter said it's his emotional support cat
I'm getting worried. It's like he's totally obsessed with that thing.
Captain Blofeld, well he is our number one.
All this for a cat video?
We don't know who he is. He was justn sitting there when we commandeered the ship.
Alright, where's the pussy?
They can be so cliquey.
He doesn’t look like any Super-Villain I’ve ever seen.
When he said, "She really scratches my post", it just got uncomfortable.
He doesn't know it's a rat.
His cat is a good ratter. Grab it when he walks the plank.
Says he wants to turn us into a nonprofit.
Captain says he wants to come back as a cat when he dies, I think he's already come back as a jackass.
Ever since the mutiny he's been chasing the white cat.
He named it Mr. Meow.
I thought getting him a pet would make him a more relatable leader. Instead, the cat is now First Mate and dog parks have lost all funding.
Once he tires of that kitty, he'll fixate on some other poor creature.
The captain loves Whiskers. Whiskers loved Polly...but in a different way.
That's O'Reilly. He's the black sheep in a family of pussy-grabbers.
He reminds me of that guy from 'Fiddler on the Hoof.'
Won the trip and the cat on some game show.
Mr. Whiskers only loves him more because of the scratching post.
Just wait until the cat finds its scratching post.
Aye. The doc said a few minutes a day with the cat would help the Cap'n take his mind off the other thing.
The cat's Moby, Dick is his dog.
He promised to transform my parrot.
So what are you gonna name your new hull design? I dunno. What do you think of "Catandaman"?
She's only using him for his scratching post.
Captain is longer driven mad by his Moby. See that pussycat? He asked for its consent before grabbing it, and now they're both having a whale of a time." "Doesn't help with the scurvy, though.
The beast sharpens the claws by rubbing the flesh off his leg, and he loves the animal?
It gets really lonely on these cruises.
Ever since he got that mobile scratching post, pussy has literally been falling in his lap.
They met at a scratching post convention.
All I asked for was emancipation.
And the winner is 'Moby's Dick,' starring Gregory's Peck.
I thought he said white whale not white cat!
He did not want the cat to use his wooden leg as a scratching post
Darn It..the new fellow has taken my pet cat away.
Rumor has it he stocks the cannons with furballs.... what a CAT-astrophe..
Two peas in a pod: They both like playing cat and mouse games.
We got some gold coins, but he got the kitty.
I think HE meant gate.
This is really off-brand for us.
It’s not fair that he gets a nice hat and we have to wear shmates on our head.
...and he prays funny too!
Huh, I thought he'd be bigger.
Cats ward off scurrrvy.
Looks like Korean barbecue for dinner
Avast, ye scurvy dog's scurvy cat ate me parrot!
Strange days indeed...have you been to the first mate's coffeehouse in Nantucket?
Incendiary Pete's trying out the latest PBMT: Positive Behavior Modification Tactic, a Cat-'o-one-tail.
...some sort of symbiotic relationship. He scratches her and she scratches his peg-leg
I can't believe we looked all over for that thing
Rumor has it the cat will only eat whale.
Ahab thinks he's a Bond villain.
I think it's your turn to scoop the pot of gold.
Soon, my precious. Very soon.
No more voyages for me. I'm tired of being the last one for rationed milk.
Be the white cat agent or be the white cat principle, given the results, I really don't care.
"HIS MIND HAS GONE COMPLETELY OFF WHALING SINCE HE TOOK A LIKING TO FLUFFY".
We just ignore him. He came with Peter Pan.
Ever since his psychiatrist gave him that white therapy cat, he's become unbelievably boring.
I guess the cat's out of the bag.
He's missing his leg.
Arrrr..fetch me parrot..
And I thought these short pants were weird.
I don't have the heart to tell him, he's caught Moby Kit
She only pretends to like him so she can use his leg as a scratching post
Well another mystery is solved. We now know who let the cat out of the bag.
For as much as I'll be charging you, I figure I'd entertain you a little.
OLD PEGLEG, FOUND HIMSELF SOME SEAPUSSY!
It's whale we want, not pussy.
Here's where we come in. Sing with me, 'Carefully on tiptoe stealing...'
He really changed after meeting Lincoln.
If he doesn't stop giving her treats, she's going to be as big as a whale"
That's the cat's pa.
If there's mice around that pot of gold he's looking for, his kitty will luck out, too!
Aye, the Captain is an odd man. You could write a book about him, Herman.
Be careful what you say. The Captain brought him on board to find rats.
Pussy keeps his mind off "You Know Who," and that's a good thing. We're actually anchored just off Far Rockaway, and he hasn't even noticed.
I just felt like we needed more diversity.
Looks like the Cap'n loves Kitty more than he hates Moby
I bet he saves a ton on scratching posts.
It's true, All Ahab's need is Love
We're screwed... he gave our last lime to his cat.
'Moby Dick: The Manx' doesn't quite cut it for me.
White whale,white cat,I'm thinking Ahab is obsessed!
well he doesn't belong here
It looks nice, but the cat is after his leg
You mean, what's he got that you ain't aside from being both the captain and a human scratching post?
He's not the stereotypical pirate, but boy is he good at his job.
He says he is Sir Richard Whittington.
He is dealing with a pertinent issue at the moment.
If you've ever had the chicken at Chow Hop you know exactly what it would taste like.
He’s a real buccaneer, but I worry when he says ‘Grab her by the...’
My students are ready for their OWLs.
That cat's becalmed Ahab and the the sea...
He's using it for bait !
Do you think that's what he meant when he said "I grab them by the pussy"?
We're gonna need seven lives if we want to sail all seven seas.
You and Trump are on my mind
They're hard to tell apart but Ahab's got the peg on the other leg.
Aye, the skipper decided that the hunt for the white kitty was more achievable.
Peg leg´s a hell of a cook and they say his cat Scratch provides him with special ingredients.
Aye, old Ismael there told me about it being big and white, but then again he also tried to book separate accommodations for the snow leopard on his lap.
You take the cat, I'll take the hat.
It was using his leg as a scratching post.
No, Herm, call me 'Icks-mael' from now on.
'Ya think the whale's safe?"
Do you think he knows this boat is going to China?
Did you see the way he grabbed Tony's pussy? It's unconscionable!
He's cast in The Music Man on the lido deck.
Of course the mice are playing. Shuffleboard.
We're hunting for white fish for Tabby.
Everybody notices the peg leg but it's that cat, Ishmael, I wonder about.
It keeps the termites away.
Sorry, we can't bump passengers anymore.
Have you heard him walk the plank?
He even lets the cat use his leg as a scratching post
It ruin their trip if we tell them the mice have left already!
Not sure, but thinking the first mate is grabbing some pussy.
I swear, he's obsessed with that creature.
I ordered a cat o' nine tails.
He's promising kitty a whale of a dinner.
Arrr, when yonder swab identified hisself as Doolittle, I didun know he be describin' his work ethic.
'From Hell's heart I stab at thee.' to 'Nice kitty, kitty.' That's a heckuva therapy cat.
It's the right of succession...the cat ate the captain’s parrot.
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, cats vs pirates .
Captain Ahab cannot decide if he loves animals or hates them!!
Make sure we get the story on the litter box before he walks the plank.
'That beast should'a left the leg, and taken everything else. Let's get some grog."
I was thinking about having a cat stew for dinner
Ishmael? We call him Puff's daddy.
Let's start calling Captain Wilbur by a name that makes him seem like more of a mensch.
He's had to adjust to his loss--Polly wanted a cracker, but fluffy wanted a drumstick.
They're right -- it was the cat.
Cap'n had best put sisal on that peg o' his.
The captain has never been the same since he bought that cat
Arg, wish captain would just give use a fraction of the affection he gives to that darn cat!
Abraham Lincoln is turning out to be a really lousy pirate
So I says to him, "Cap'n, what you need is a Great White Kitty".
If only I had a wooden leg, she would sharpen her claws and cuddle me afterward.
Do you think she told him we're taking over the ship?
There were no cats on the nina, the pinta, or the santa maria! Everyone go home, the reenactment is ruined!
I don't think the Captain gets the gist of a Catapult.
Damned white kittykat !
Maybe he'll settle for the Great White Pussycat
That'll be awful, but what if the cat dies first?
So the promo was "Five Nights, Six Days on a Pirate Ship," right?
Moby Dick, Moby Pussy, Moby Dick, Moby Pussy...Just shoot me!
Who said he's feraless?
And I can't even tell you what they did to the parrot . . .
It's a good change for him after all the fish and seagulls.
Ever since the missus walked the plank.
HE'S FINALLY GIVING UP HIS WHALE OBSESSION
Is that Doctor Doolittle?
It helps get his mind off that blasted whale...
Now grow eight more tails and you'll save me a quid.
He sure is hooked on mammals.
Have ye seen the white mouse?
His therapist recommended an emotional support animal.
It's called 'soft power', Mr. let's-mutiny-every-other-day.
With a name like Jonah, he'll need a four-leaf clover and a rainbow, too.
When your friend says I'm here and you walk outside and they're not.
I never thought the mutiny was going to be a quiet usurpation, but sending our captain the cat was a purfect idea.
I miss the crocodile.
Puritans usually bring along the white cats.
Beware of meek looking Irishmen!
Honestly, I hate that cat.
Moby is late again
Great idea except I wouldn't have bought him a white furred cat.
Starbuck's white cat?
He needs a lot of emotional support since the whale took his leg.
It only likes him for the scratching post.
ADA and PETA violations. Arrrr.
Banished and lost left leg for using a private email server.
Set sail for the nearest pharmacy, mate. We're running out of his meds.
The cat ate that noisy parrot.
With the cat, everything's changed.
Curling is just not the same on a ship deck as it is on ice
That's Jolly Rogers and Ginger Rogers.
So I sez to im " You will find that whale right after you pull an albatross from your crotch"
You know kitty only loves him best because he has that built-in scratching post.
For getting past customs, image is everything.
It's sacrilege to sing, 'Nearer My Cat To Thee."
Retired pirate and his cat at sea. Something looks fishy to me.
It might look cute, but I warn ye, it'll chase th' parrot right off ye shoulder
Call me Ishmael. Some years ago - never mind how long precisely - okay, enough. Actually, I'm Frank. The cat's the one with the cool name and the ripping sea yarn.
Pirate Stump has grabbed more pussies than all the other pirates of the seven seas combined! Arrr!
I dare ya Bart, go ask 'im if that's 'is service cat.
He started watching cat videos.
Did you eat my leftover pancake from lunch?
He couldn't very well put his foot down, no pets.
...and that's Moby-Pussy.
Aye, best friends once Seymour stopped using the pegleg as a scratching post.
He caught the Captain's eye that's why!
Cat o'nine tails idea,that's him!
I heard he lost his leg in a Catamaran!
He barrels all the fish
Finally ran out of caption contest ideas they did.
I don't care what Captain says, burying catnip is a bad idea.
'If he doesn't stop striking through pasteboard masks right this instant, he'll get an eye to match that leg'
The introduction of comfort cats has certainly changed onboard morale.
What does he have that I don't?
His father was a veterinarian, his mother was Irish and he used to have a pet alligator.
It's his service animal
e's been a pettin' dat damed cat ever since last month when he yelled through the bull horn at that Whaler out of New Bedford, "Aye, I be Captain Ahap of the Pequod. 'Ave ya seen the Great White Whale?" and the captain said, "Got 'em yestarday!
Methinks this therapy animal business be a ruse, Ahab.
Sure, I feed him tuna but Peg Leg Pat comes with his own scratching post.
Call me Ishi but the old captain never had that much affection for the larger animals
He never makes time for us anymore
We touch the cat, we walk the plank.
So . . . now if the CAT leaves, we're sinkin'?
It was OK until he named it Moby Cat.
Captain Ahab says it's an emotional support animal, but no one dares to ask him for the documentation.
The captain's cat to be kitten me!
He's just heard Moby Dick has his own restaurant.
times sure have changed. when honest abe grabbed em by the pussy, the pussy bit back, and he lost his leg.
Sometimes we wonder which one is the pussy cat and which one is running the ship!
It wasn't the shark but the cat who bit off his leg.
I know your cousin is head of all cruise line entertainment, but I'm not sure the creative partnership with PETA for a more PC Civil War reenactment show works?
He thinks having a white cat will help him find a white whale.
Looks like they hired someone to help us choose funnier pirate captions.
He found the cure to seasickness.
"Wonder why the captain named his cat pussyfoot?
I don't trust them since Longtail and Squeak went missing.
Why look, doesn't Mr. Lincoln love stroking that pussy.
And then he told Mittens was the new First Mate.
Just grab him by the pussy.
No service dogs allowed. Bump him to the next boat.
I THINK THIS AIRBNB THING IS WORKING OUT VERY NICELY!
We are getting his famous stew tonight.
I didn't think diversity was an issue on this carnival ride.

I'd throw him off the yardarm if I could

HE SHOULD FISH INSTEAD, FOR PROTEIN
Old Blackbeard certainly seems to be in a better mood since he got that therapy kitten.
You missed it but Mr. Pussy-Pants gave me the sweetest cuddles this morning.
Ahab's theory is as long as the cat hasn't used up all its nine lives, by keeping it on board, we're safe.

The kind hearted man

He thinks that we are getting very close to Mr. Bond.
Think I have a chance with him?
He used to have his leg before that cat started licking it like that.
