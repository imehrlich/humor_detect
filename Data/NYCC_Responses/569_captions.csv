The shareholders sent me.
And to share his excitement about the new health care plan, here's Tom from human resources.
Spider!!
Someone must have broken the glass ceiling again.
I'll just hover here.
'Ok, so, going forward, there should be a soft landing when we touch base'
I knew he was full of hot air, but i didn't know it was this bad..
Well, that's one glass ceiling out of the way.
Some people don't know their place.
Stevens, you have to wait at least 60 minutes after eating.
He's like this whenever he doesn't get his way.
Today is Roger's last day as a test pilot. Just imagine tomorrow's meeting, coffee delivered when you want it and how you like it.
Would you mind moving your coffee over?

More like BORED room!
Look ma, no soul!
Will Steve's preexisting condition be adequately covered in a high-risk pool?

He got his start in our typing pool.
The Board recommends, "against".
John is our independent member of the board.
Yes, he certainly appears to be 'special', but perhaps not the prosecutor we were hoping for.
You have been doing a lot of tweeting so I want to make sure I got a birds eye view of you.
If stock prices had risen it would have been a gainer.
His flying sit spin is superb.
Charles tends to over-react to upticks in the market.
Funny, I don't remember meeting you guys on the way up.
He gets leadership and levitation mixed up.
Whoa! Way to crash a meeting, Jack!
Reynolds, your enthusiasm for the new ad campaign is duly noted!
Sorry,they're charging more if you want to land.

OK, let's bounce around some ideas.
Frank must have lost his golden parachute!!
Dimmsdale, this is not what we meant when we said, 'You need to make an impact on the business.'
Sensing his job was at risk, Steve decided to make his value known by metaphor.

He always drops in late

Before I quit this company for a better opportunity, I just want to make one lasting impression.
Griggsby suddenly senses his cannonball entry will not make the splash he intended.

He's been doing this ever since we got rid of the secretary pool.
Then it's agreed, we'll take a flyer on the merger.
Well, here comes the interoffice male.

I guess we should've left the extra chair there after all.
Last time I'm flying United!
Oh no! Another hostile takeover attempt!

Larry, pull out the pillow!
What'd I tell you? No glass ceiling.
This is a disruptive innovation.
It's Phil; he's practicing his soft skills.

I heard he made a big splash at his last job.
Mr. Smith's misunderstanding of the term overhead annoyed his associates.

Make up your mind. Are you coming or going?
We hired him because he's a pioneer in rewriting the Laws of Gravity...
I said it from the start, a ceilingless boardroom was a bad idea.
Must we table every motion?
That's not what I meant by; 'Make a big splash'!

Geronimo!
I heard you were looking for an angel investor.
Instead of leaning in, I decided to jump in.
Sometimes you just gotta say "Geronimo!"
Told you he would drop in!
His presentation didn't land.

No one has ever stuck the landing on the table.
Don't worry, he's always trying to get the jump on everyone.
You said to "drop in" to the meeting after my 4:15 ended . . . .
I meant "hop right on it" after the meeting is over.
He's finally gone off the deep end.
If we don't start turning a profit, the guys upstairs are going to come down hard on us.

I guess that golden parachute was just a rumor.
He thought the book was called 'Leap In'.
I think Dave has misunderstood his invitation to the secretarial pool.
Someone said to pool our resources!
Dave always finishes his presentations with a superhero landing on the desk.

He can't get enough of the latest Donald flip.
His range of emotional expression is in the style Tom Cruise
Another meeting - yippee!
Not again! How does Jim always get a jumpstart on the avocado breakfast?
Hold it,I think Fred has come up with a solution to the accounting short fall.

This was more fun in the steno pool.
Tom Cruise to see you Mr. Ovitz.
Ah, here comes Mr. Adderley.
Who hired this guy, I said that after lunch, we all need to jump into our asset risk pool?
The new guy's arrival quickly made a big impact in the advertising department.
We didn't see the implications of the new gas tax.
I kid you not. It's part of our the new on-site well-being program. Parkour-porate.

Joe's cannonball entrance didn't quite go as planned.
Aw, that guy's always flying by the seat of his pants.
Yates, Bharara, Comey. I wonder who'll be.... Oh! Him.
Alright! If we're finally in the black, I'm expecting a raise.
We have a zero-tolerance policy for zero-gravity.
Larry will not disagree with the boss again.
Not quite the breakthrough we expected.
I didn't mean literally channel Miley Cyrus, Dudley!
The boss told me to dive right in.
Cannonball Bob's big splash in the corporate think tank.
I'd like to introduce Fred Robbins, Chairman of the Diving Board.
Surprise, bitches!
Well that's one way to stop the investigation.
Give that guy a fidget spinner!

I think Bob went off the deep end.
Who else can jump this high?
Who told you this was the steno pool?
Sorry I'm late, but it was a bumpy ride!
Marco ...
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?
So what if sales are up 15% for the quarter, can you do this?!
board seat or not-my anti gravity thing deserves a vote.
When we said you were fired, we meant from the company not out of a cannon
What I said was, Trump called a special procescutor!
Looks like another re-org.
Rather than presenting his report, Hastings went with a cannonball.
Got a great canon at the Ringling brothers salvage sale.
