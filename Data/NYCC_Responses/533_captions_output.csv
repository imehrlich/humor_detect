Another waiter will be along every ten minutes or so.
Apologies for the delay. We have limited service on the weekends.

Perhaps the minute steak?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We accept AMEX, Visa and Metrocard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I know, but it would be twice as expensive on the other side of the tracks,,,,,,,,,,,,,

May I interest you in our wino list?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Candidly, I would not recommend anything local.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We proudly accept Visa or MetroCard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You folks must be from out of town.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Will you be paying with cash, credit card or Metrocard?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Someone's not getting a second date.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not to rush you, but our next seating is at 7:02.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yes, very fresh; comes in every eight minutes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is a quiet table, intermittently,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Another Manhattan?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your first course will be arriving in 8 minutes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Could I start you off with a Manhattan?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prix fixe includes two bus transfers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Would you prefer the express menu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sorry, but the Express Menu is not available at this station.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I highly suggest you order the soufflé before the next train.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The halibut is delayed at 86th.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's our most popular table for those with off-off-Broadway tickets.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If that guy behind me jumps, dessert's on the house.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We only accept tokens.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I said, WOULD YOU CARE TO HEAR ABOUT TODAY'S SPECIALS?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our chef prepares the ratatouille without the atouille.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Actually all of our orders are ‘to-go.’,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Will that be tap or sewer?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Geez, the menu is nothing like the Subway we have back home.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I told you this place was off the beaten track.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I strongly recommend the minute steak.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All I'm saying is that the fish is fresher at Fulton Street.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Something to go?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You're lucky you got a table, it's like Grand Central Station in here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yes sir, it is fast food...,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Will this be for here or to go?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fine choice, sir. Those are imported from 14th Street.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Welcome to Trains Cuisine; I'll be conducting your meal; Shall I help you choo-choo choose? God, I hate my life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Actually aren't we all sort of waiters here?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our patrons usually come from the other side of the tracks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The dessert trolley will arrive in 30 minutes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would avoid the local game entree.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We have a proprietary method for tenderizing the meat about every 7 minutes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Is that for here or to go?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This place is a frequent stop for locals.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Are we in a rush this evening?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Welcome to the original Subway, Sir...,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The locally-sourced small game is particularly good at this location.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Of course it's local.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm sorry, we only accept Metrocard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I said let's eat at Subway, this isn't what I meant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We accept Visa, Metrocard, and American Express.,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm afraid the 3:42 special is gone. May I suggest the 4:04?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You said," ""nowhere near the kitchen.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,
You're unhappy about the fare?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yes, m'am – everything here is local.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All of our ingredients are locally sourced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your appetizer should arrive in the next 6-8 minutes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our cocktail special this evening is called the Third Rail. It's to die for.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yes, dear. Next time I'll read the Groupon fine print.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Local? Yes, everything is local.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Welcome to the original Subway. All the others are franchises.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Is this to go?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The special comes with a side order of noise and indifference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To the best of my knowledge, everything on the menu was run over today.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very good. I'll be back with your entrees at 9:37.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Would you like to hear about tonight's schedules?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our martinis are shaken, not stirred.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
...And our early bird special is whatever comes in stuck to the front of the 5:04.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This evening our appetizers are operating as entrees, our side dishes are skipping local stops, and our wine list is only available in Brooklyn.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Welcome to the Little Restaurant That Could.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do you want this order to go?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you want to be further from the band we do also have a table at 86th Street.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Of course everything is local.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I understand you're in a rush.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So that's one local and one espresso.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The catch of the day will be arriving in three minutes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very fresh, madam. It was hit four stops from here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yes. Everything is local.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
May I suggest something other than a Cab?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Lobster Newburg is very nice, but unfortunately it is running fifteen minutes late.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ironically, we don't take American Express.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What brings you folks here tonight, the menu or the ambience?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm sorry, but this is not my station.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Would you like a bag or glass with your wine?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Local or espresso?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For here or to go?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your server will be here at 8:48 pm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You'll probably want something quick.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'd steer clear of the catch of the day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We're the first track-to-table restaurant in the city.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You'll be happy to know that nothing on the menu is locally grown.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our special today is rat, which is track to table.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
May I recommend the ratatouille. It's local.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A homeless man in a diaper will be here to yell the specials at you shortly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I assume you want this to go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I must warn you against the chef's surprise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No, we don’t accept MetroCard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
May I start you off with a nice pair of headphones?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Honestly, if you want the fresh flounder, I'd take the B line out to Sheepshead Bay.,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chef will be here any minute.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The special tonight is track of lamb,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What pairs well with the stench of urine?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The special today is ratatouille.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There, now youse guys aren't sitting near the bathroom no more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is a 3 minute delay on the appetizers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would not recommend the ratatouille.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everything you see here is local.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We'll have the 7:30 downtown pre-fixe - the 7:03 appetizer, the 7: 10 entree, the 7:22 dessert and our check at 7:27.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Espresso? This is a local stop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The bathroom is to your left, to your right, and just behind you.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sorry, but the express menu is not available at this stop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I can understand your frustration but I believe the phrase in Zagat was ""authentic atmosphere""..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rat serves two.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You may wish to try our flattened chicken.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Did you want that to go?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You'll have to decide now. The chef is out of here on the 7:25.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What do you think this is? Subway?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everything here is local.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I suggest the minute steak.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good evening, my name is Steve. I'll be your Waiter for approximately the next 6 minutes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Would you like to be mugged before the main course or during?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tonight's dinner specials will arrive at 7:58, 8:07, 8:16, and 8:23. If you wish to order the soufflé, it will arrive 8:47.,,,,,,,,,,

The ratatouille is excellent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tonight, the broccolini comes from a small farm on the N line.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The special tonight is our VERY fresh venison from track 27.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was free-range until it got creamed by the R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
May I suggest a sidecar to go with your commuter special?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Please be aware that the chef is operating on a holiday schedule.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not free range per se, but caught on the express track.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I recommend the pigeon. They're locally raised.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The catch of the day, sir? I'm pretty sure you'd rather not know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The branzini is coated in panko crumbs and then lightly seared on the third rail.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What exactly is your ""locally sourced meat""?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Of course we will gladly validate your token.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sparkling, tap, or the curious ceiling drip from the uptown A?,,,,,,,,,,,,
We accept, cash, major credit cards and tokens.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gluten free? I'm afraid you are on the wrong side of the tracks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Order right now, and I can have your entrées here at 5:15, your desserts at 5:19, and I can have you out of here at 5:23.,,,,,,,,,,,
Everything comes with a side of grime.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your drinks will arrive in 4 min.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You could go with the veal, but our track-to-table entrees are really the house specialty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Welcome to the chew chew train.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Could you hurry it up, folks? The second seating gets in at 9:03 sharp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your drinks will arrive. In four. Minutes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We are experiencing some delays, but expect to be serving shortly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So that'll be one lo-cal and one express-o?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well, how did you think it got from farm to table?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Can I recommend the third-rail seared scallops?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We offer our special sautéed, baked or third-rail grilled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A bit gamey, but they are locally sourced and free range.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Are you waiting for the BMT or the BLT?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Have you tried our uptown location?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Did you order a sidecar?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Madame et Monsieur, you did say you wanted a table away from the kitchen ...,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you'd like something raw, organic, and slow, 'The C Train' is popular.,,,,,,,,,,,
I suggest you hold off on the soufflé until the express passes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yes, the 6:47 is good, but personally I prefer the 7:02.,,,,,,,,,,,,
No! We don't serve Subway sandwiches.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tonight's protein is locally sourced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our specials this evening are the grilled sea bass at 7:49 and the linguini with clam sauce at 8:02.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'd avoid the ratatouille.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yes, it IS regrettable that the city has banned sidewalk service.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Perhaps you would prefer something from our express menu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We had to stop serving cheese.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our filet of beef special comes seared on the third rail.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There may be a few others joining us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everything's local -- until 8:03,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The mushrooms are very fresh. They were grown in the tunnel at 24th street.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Visa or MetroCard only.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You did ask for a table not close to the kitchen, no?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You know there's a take-out menu, right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sorry for the wait folks. It's been like Grand Central Station around here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chef recommends the ratatouille.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This isn't even our worst table.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ah yes, the Pigeon is an excellent choice!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The A at the top of the menu is the train; the C in the corner is from the Health Department.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Will you both be having the express lunch today?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Welcome, to the original Subway,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well, let's just say it all tastes like chicken.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
May I suggest an Absolut Train Wreck?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Surprisingly enough," we don't have a ""to go"" menu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
All the rats on the menu are free range.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Orders are running on time, Sir.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sorry, the sommelier ran out to get more brown paper bags.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do you want to order now, or wait for the next menu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And a delicious possum that was hit by the 8 Train not 20 minutes ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sub sandwich. Oh, I've never heard that one before.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are no substitutions, but you can change at 59th street.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Please note our soufflé is experiencing a slight delay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You need another three seconds to decide?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Validate your parking?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The ratatouille is locally sourced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
. . and all the food is Local.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Actually Sir, everything is steamed here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you wanted faster service you should've come during rush hour.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We passed by many times and the food always looked great !,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All meats are local raised and served track to table.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How about a nice Minute Steak?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The subway sandwich has proved to be popular,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I cannot recommend the ratatouille.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Everything here, sir, is local.,,,,,,,,,,,,

We don't serve a 6-inch meatball sub, sir. You're thinking of somewhere else.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everything's local.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No sir, I'm afraid we don't accept MetroCard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our food is fresh from turnstile to table.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I recommend the express meal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The meal may be delayed, the new chef has been very hard to train.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Almost everyone gets the sub.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chef recommends the pigeon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I said I wanted to eat at Subway, this wasn't what I had in mind.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Express options are all available, but Local specialties are held up, due to an incident at Chambers St.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Many diners take it to go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fortunately, none of our ingriedients is locally sourced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All the produce is locally sourced, but the local is running seven minutes late.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Our freshest selections can be found in the ""Train-to-Table"" section.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why yes, the Chardonnay pairs quite nicely with the approaching A train.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What time do the specials arrive?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today's special is ratatouille.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Take your time. The train just left.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yes," there has been a remarkable increase of ""dining and dashing"" since we opened this location.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Can I start you off with our gust of stinky wind?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The tube steak is worth the wait.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I think you will like our prices. Our overhead is very very low.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And finally tonight, due to necessary track work and the D train detour, we have brisket and stuffed cabbage fresh from Borough Park.,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you’re waiting for the 8.15 to Boston, may I recommend the minute steak,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And our special today is #23. It will stop you in your tracks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'd recommend the three minute eggs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No sir; we do not take tokens as payment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tonight's special is a 100% locally sourced ratatouille.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No, we don't validate for parking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just the four-minute eggs, then?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I appreciate the irony but the chef prefers 'hoagie'.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yes, I can have you out before the 6:52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My stomach is rumbling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
May I recommend the earplugs?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ironically, we don't serve subs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Many of our rats recommend the pizza.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well, we did ask not to be seated near the bathroom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We appeal more to the tunnel crowd than the bridge crowd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You should order before the rush.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our produce is brought in fresh daily, and in fact it's every six minutes during rush hour.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We are experiencing signal problems at 14th St, so the Lobster FRA Diavolo is not available for the moment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everything is shaken and not stirred.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You can choose between our local menu or take a chance on the express,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good thing you made it before the evening rush.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Try our special; the strap-hanger steak.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The first course starts here and ends in long island.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
... and our fish is specially imported from the Bronx.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The wine steward will be delayed. We regret any inconvenience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh yes. Our main course specials run well below the street price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The rat is very fresh and comes with a side of pizza,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Welcome to The Tavern on the Platform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our chef really puts the 'rat' in ratatouille.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'll be back every 10 minutes or so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Smart of you to beat the dinner rush.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Welcome to the other Subway restaurant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Would you like the express lunch?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Will this be to go or for here?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you see something you want to order, say something.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is not exactly what I had in mind when I said ""Let's meet at the ""Subway"" on 23rd Street for lunch.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just to warn you Sir, we currently only take payment by Metrocard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Should I assume this is to go?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The sardines aren't available 'til rush hour.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This wasn't what I was thinking when it said," ""Easy access to transportation"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,
If it's not listed as express, it's local.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I suggest the local fare.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sometimes people forget to make a reservation. They get sidetracked. It happens.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The owner heard the underground economy was thriving,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Will you be going straight to the theatre afterward?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Okay: hors d’oeuvres at Marble Hill; soup at City College; salad at Cathedral Parkway; entrées: chicken/rib eye/haddock at Lincoln Center; cheese with pear slices & Madeira at Sheridan Square; brandy & coffee at Chambers Street. Bon appétit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
... and we have an excellent selection of canned wines.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you’re liberal, you might enjoy our progressive dinner: each course served at a different station.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Due to an earlier incident, express items are delayed tonight. I would recommend the local menu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The chef apologizes for the delay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The restroom is just up the stairs and half a block away, in the Starbucks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well, Subway is trying to improve it's image, you know, since Jared.,,,,,,,,,,,
I assure you Madam, we have no affiliation with that above ground sandwich chain.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Could we see a to-go menu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our specialty is the Flatiron steak.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would suggest the subway sandwich.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
May I suggest that, in future, you settle for the table near the kitchen?,,,,,,,,,,,,
What's the daily fare?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm Orpheus and I'll be your server.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you plan to take the next train, may I suggest the one ounce filet?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Almost everyone here gets the sub.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Are you going to pay by cash credit or token?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The good news is that this is the no-smoking section.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I recommend the squab if Madam is watching her caboose tonight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Luckily, you just beat the dinner rush.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Locally sourced? No, this is the express platform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We get so few diners-in. Most of our business is takeout.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm just the trainee.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The downtown sommelier will arrive in 3 minutes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
...and will this be for here or to go..?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No, you have to actually go to a Subway™ for that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All of tonight's entrees are seared to perfection on the third rail.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I recommend you order off the ""Express Menu.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The kitchen's in Poughkeepsie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I didn't think you could do worse than taking me to Subway for our anniversary. I was wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
May I suggest the third rail seared ahi.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maybe you should look at the takeout menu instead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
...and if you would like the soufflé, I suggest you order now as the dessert car only arrives every 25 minutes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fares please.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sorry, but the Chateau Margaux is served on the uptown platform only.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The number 6 is at 28th Street. Might I suggest the minute steak?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why yes, we do serve vermin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
May I recommend the Subway sandwich.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Welcome to our underground patio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I didn't know you meant here when you said we were eating at Subway for dinner.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The dining car is running a little late. Can I bring you something from the vending machine?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The catch of the day is ratatouille.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spare any change folks?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tonight our appetizers are running as scheduled but all entrees will be delayed due to unforeseen maintenance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Indeed, madam -- the specials are listed right below departure times.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
May I recommend the S-Car-Go?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sir, we only accept tokens here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No Sir, the chicken isn't local. It took the express from Poughkeepsie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
May I suggest the track of lamb?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm sorry, but at this location, we don't serve an Express Menu.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your express meal is one station away.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tonight's special is grilled 3rd rail chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sorry, we don't accept tokens or Metrocards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The special today can be served between the 6:24 and the 7:32.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Will that be to-go, Sir?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your platinum package gives you 3 courses in the next 7 minutes, sir.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sorry, we're out of the halibut but if you hurry there's still two steaks left at 59th Street.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"' Your appetizers should be arriving northbound on the 6:18 local.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The special today is 4:50 to Philadelphia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Might I suggest the straphanger steak?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sir, all parties are seated according to their station.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'll never trust Zagat again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is not a Subway. This is THE Subway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good evening. My name is Andre. I'll be you're waiter until my train shows up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
May I suggest the 3rd Rail Rabbit over rice?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You made it just in time before the 5:17 crowd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And what did you do to upset the hostess?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I told you we should have tipped the maître d'.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Is the rat trash-fed?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tonight's Peking Duck will be arriving from Chinatown on the #5 train at precisely 8:23 PM.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Have you lost your thought of train?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You're the one who always wants to try new restaurants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We have only chicken and beef here. Seafood comes in on the westbound platform over there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you hurry, the catch of the day will be the last train to Jersey.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The pastry trolley may be a few minutes late.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The lamb dish comes from a restaurant on Astor Place and the salmon from one near Union Square. For anything from our uptown restaurants, I'm afraid we'll have to move you to the other platform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
