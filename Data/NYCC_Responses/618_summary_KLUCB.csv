6112,2579,5,21,98,124,1.25,0.04669091947809488,618,I bagged that one while on a very remote and dangerous Nigerian carousel!

5907,2579,7,16,97,120,1.25,0.05055712025979709,618,...and the strip steaks were particularly magical.

3352,2579,5,20,95,120,1.25,0.04770650232563333,618,Really surprising .... like chicken-flavored cotton candy
61,2579,3,24,93,120,1.25,0.04467435863364723,618,"Now most people say it doesn't count as 'real' hunting, but let me tell you, when I was on that carousel and this guy was lunging right at me..."
337,2579,6,18,96,120,1.25,0.049152480980664874,618,It's eyes are opening....we should probably run...
532,2579,7,16,97,120,1.25,0.05055712025979709,618,..and this one we shot on safari at the local merry-go-round.
3546,2579,4,22,94,120,1.25,0.04621530419392146,618,My daughter was only six when she bagged her first trophy.
653,2579,4,22,94,120,1.25,0.04621530419392146,618,There was glitter everywhere!
719,2579,4,22,94,120,1.25,0.04621530419392146,618,It wouldn’t stay out of the roses.

982,2579,5,20,95,120,1.25,0.04770650232563333,618,I added the eyelashes myself
1047,2579,6,18,96,120,1.25,0.049152480980664874,618,Bagged it on his mythical hunting trip.
1092,2579,6,18,96,120,1.25,0.049152480980664874,618,I donated the rest of the body to the crazy glue factory.
1228,2579,5,20,95,120,1.25,0.04770650232563333,618,My daughter hasn’t tried to argue with me since.
1229,2579,6,18,96,120,1.25,0.049152480980664874,618,"Oh, that's just my horse. He backed into a spear, so I had to put him down."
1610,2579,6,18,96,120,1.25,0.049152480980664874,618,It Was Just A Shot In The Dark !
1825,2579,8,14,98,120,1.25,0.05192377520339357,618,This poor bloke was actually a sports mascot.
1944,2579,6,18,96,120,1.25,0.049152480980664874,618,"Luckily, I was still a virgin."
643,2579,7,16,97,120,1.25,0.05055712025979709,618,"Her mother was a horse, her dad, a Narwhal."
2181,2579,5,20,95,120,1.25,0.04770650232563333,618,"I bagged it the same year the Cubs became World Series champions, something else I didn't believe could exist."
3309,2579,5,20,95,120,1.25,0.04770650232563333,618,The other two I shot in America recently but this one was from a happier time.
3305,2579,3,24,93,120,1.25,0.04467435863364723,618,I want to instill the love of the sport to the grandkids while they're still young.
3125,2579,7,16,97,120,1.25,0.05055712025979709,618,Snagged that one at the merry-go-round. They still talk about it.
3008,2579,8,13,95,116,1.25,0.05319619424788554,618,"Yep, killed it with kindness."
2781,2579,7,16,97,120,1.25,0.05055712025979709,618,This particular one didn't play well on Facebook at the time.
2722,2579,6,18,96,120,1.25,0.049152480980664874,618,I tracked this one for miles after it left my granddaughter’s birthday party.
2027,2579,7,18,103,128,1.25,0.04834871689297298,618,"Doesn't look like it's worth a billion, does it?"
2700,2579,5,20,95,120,1.25,0.04770650232563333,618,"It makes you respect the majesty of nature, doesn’t it?"
2514,2579,3,25,96,124,1.25,0.043792479657892625,618,"Well, have you ever been to Nebraska?"
2471,2579,6,18,96,120,1.25,0.049152480980664874,618,My daughter shot this one.
2470,2579,7,16,97,120,1.25,0.05055712025979709,618,My daughter has never forgiven me.
2368,2579,9,12,99,120,1.25,0.05325537018725447,618,A little double-sided tape and hot glue... boom... a zebra.
2269,2579,1,28,91,120,1.25,0.0414208434789757,618,"My daughter, Becky, shot this one. She's a lobbyist for the NRA now days."
2240,2579,4,22,94,120,1.25,0.04621530419392146,618,"Yes, it is a unique horn."
2560,2579,8,14,98,120,1.25,0.05192377520339357,618,I thought it was a glitter gun.
6585,2645,7,17,101,125,1.248,0.04906348750804017,618,They were never going to raise enough to save the carousel. I got there first and saved these fine trophies!
5534,2645,5,21,99,125,1.248,0.04635904755624927,618,I was trying to shoot a My Little Pony but he’ll have to do.
6107,2645,5,21,99,125,1.248,0.04635904755624927,618,"Maybe I misunderstood when it said ""take me home""."
2168,2645,6,19,100,125,1.248,0.04773042581401404,618,"It's actually a horse our neighbor dressed up for young Malcom's birthday party, but it adds a bit of mystery to the trophy wall, don't you think?"
274,2645,5,21,99,125,1.248,0.04635904755624927,618,"With only one left, the extinction is not technically on me."
4751,2645,4,23,98,125,1.248,0.04494584555059639,618,The hunt for this one was magical.

6188,5942,0,8,56,64,1.125,0.041666666666666664,618,My great-grandfather shot that one in a dream.
5116,5942,0,8,56,64,1.125,0.041666666666666664,618,Since I already have the humpty back camel trophy I couldn’t pass it up.
6892,5942,1,6,57,64,1.125,0.0472455591261534,618,"As beautiful as the head of this exotic equine species may be, you can imagine how beautiful it is at the withers."
6816,5942,1,6,57,64,1.125,0.0472455591261534,618,"Mirror, mirror on the wall! Who’s the horniest of ‘em all?"
6754,5942,2,4,58,64,1.125,0.052231930877334055,618,"The myth, however, got away."
6702,5942,1,6,57,64,1.125,0.0472455591261534,618,"I never saw a unicorn. I never hope to see one. But I can tell you, anyhow, I'd rather see than be one!"
6587,5942,2,4,58,64,1.125,0.052231930877334055,618,"""My VC buddies bought it as a joke, they call me the unicorn hunter""."
3386,5942,0,8,56,64,1.125,0.041666666666666664,618,"And that's why I killed it and had it mounted. You really need to see it with your own eyes to believe it, don't you?"
6542,5942,0,8,56,64,1.125,0.041666666666666664,618,My granddaughter always wanted a unicorn.
6475,5942,0,8,56,64,1.125,0.041666666666666664,618,I bagged it on the verge of Three Mile Island and Six Flags.
6421,5942,1,6,57,64,1.125,0.0472455591261534,618,They claimed it was the largest military parade - ever!
6366,5942,1,6,57,64,1.125,0.0472455591261534,618,I had to travel to Silicon Valley to bag that one.
6364,5942,3,2,59,64,1.125,0.05678209532243724,618,Do you think it’s a white supremacy thing?
6128,5942,0,8,56,64,1.125,0.041666666666666664,618,"I'm telling you, singing candlesticks are the toughest prey you'll ever meet."
6038,5942,0,8,56,64,1.125,0.041666666666666664,618,My 8-year-old granddaughter thought we needed to brighten up the trophy wall.
5754,5942,0,8,56,64,1.125,0.041666666666666664,618,"Yes, he's alive. His stall s behind the wall, and he pokes his head through every day to feel a part of the crowd!"
5723,5942,1,6,57,64,1.125,0.0472455591261534,618,The one in fancy dress put a hell of a fight.
5720,5942,2,4,58,64,1.125,0.052231930877334055,618,It wanted me to play leap-frog.
5564,5942,1,6,57,64,1.125,0.0472455591261534,618,Just keeping it real.
5482,5942,2,4,58,64,1.125,0.052231930877334055,618,"Wow, you poached the 1%"
5386,5942,0,8,56,64,1.125,0.041666666666666664,618,"Hunted in Disney world, it was wide open..."
5285,5942,0,8,56,64,1.125,0.041666666666666664,618,"Not letting him out of my sight was a challenge, what with all his protective camouflage."
6956,5942,0,8,56,64,1.125,0.041666666666666664,618,I guess now we have to idolize the rich and beautiful.
5191,5942,1,6,57,64,1.125,0.0472455591261534,618,"Wow, I never saw myself as a unicorn!"
5175,5942,2,4,58,64,1.125,0.052231930877334055,618,I said no but he didn’t listen.
5016,5942,0,8,56,64,1.125,0.041666666666666664,618,They all seem to be from different tribes!
3365,5942,0,8,56,64,1.125,0.041666666666666664,618,This one definitly needed mounting!
1101,5942,1,6,57,64,1.125,0.0472455591261534,618,Reminds me of that polo pony that lost you the cup last year.
3111,5942,0,8,56,64,1.125,0.041666666666666664,618,Scored this beauty on the Harry Potter safari.
1481,5942,1,6,57,64,1.125,0.0472455591261534,618,I guess this means no more rainbow lattes.
1475,5942,1,6,57,64,1.125,0.0472455591261534,618,This one we hit while driving through the Fairy Forest in Utah.
1439,5942,2,4,58,64,1.125,0.052231930877334055,618,"It was close enough to stab, but my AR-15 was handier."
1258,5942,0,8,56,64,1.125,0.041666666666666664,618,Bagged him at a New Year's eve party
1109,5942,1,6,57,64,1.125,0.0472455591261534,618,"But sure as you’re born, the loveliest of all is the unicorn"
1029,5942,1,6,57,64,1.125,0.0472455591261534,618,What happened to the other horn?
961,5942,0,8,56,64,1.125,0.041666666666666664,618,"Silicon Valley used to be crawling with those, before the big venture capitalist safaris moved in."
942,5942,3,2,59,64,1.125,0.05678209532243724,618,"No, this is not a violet repression of my bisexuality. Why do you ask?"
920,5942,0,8,56,64,1.125,0.041666666666666664,618,Did we pay the Comcast bill for this month?
1499,5942,0,8,56,64,1.125,0.041666666666666664,618,"Sure, I wondered about finding a virgin to bait it, but my ex got a kick out of rubbing it in."
845,5942,1,6,57,64,1.125,0.0472455591261534,618,So I actually had a fire breathing dragon in my sights when this unicorn darted out in front..
678,5942,1,6,57,64,1.125,0.0472455591261534,618,There wasn't a serious bone in her body.
641,5942,0,8,56,64,1.125,0.041666666666666664,618,I didn't know Disneyland Paris permitted hunting.
575,5942,0,8,56,64,1.125,0.041666666666666664,618,I bagged that one. The rest I shot.
554,5942,1,6,57,64,1.125,0.0472455591261534,618,"It was so beautiful, I had to gun it down."
293,5942,1,6,57,64,1.125,0.0472455591261534,618,I still think fakes encourage recreational hunting.
154,5942,1,6,57,64,1.125,0.0472455591261534,618,It really is The Everything Store.
122,5942,1,6,57,64,1.125,0.0472455591261534,618,Aren’t they endangered at this point.

800,5942,0,8,56,64,1.125,0.041666666666666664,618,His silver glitter defense squirt wasn't lethal.
1536,5942,0,8,56,64,1.125,0.041666666666666664,618,Now that's one exotic centerpiece.
477,5942,1,6,57,64,1.125,0.0472455591261534,618,But the loveliest of all is the unicorn.
1752,5942,0,8,56,64,1.125,0.041666666666666664,618,His kid must be traumatized
1700,5942,1,6,57,64,1.125,0.0472455591261534,618,A unicorn showing a stink eye--now that's scary!
2946,5942,1,6,57,64,1.125,0.0472455591261534,618,And what makes it special is that Stormy helped me lure it!
2912,5942,2,4,58,64,1.125,0.052231930877334055,618,I came upon this one in the lap of a damsel
2811,5942,0,8,56,64,1.125,0.041666666666666664,618,Funny thing is..we didn't set out to bag a Unicorn
2757,5942,0,8,56,64,1.125,0.041666666666666664,618,"The White Rhino was too heavy, we settled for second best."
2756,5942,2,4,58,64,1.125,0.052231930877334055,618,My Little Pony died last week.

2666,5942,1,6,57,64,1.125,0.0472455591261534,618,The irony is this fella was trying to pierce my heart because I was telling tales of his existence.
2593,5942,0,8,56,64,1.125,0.041666666666666664,618,You know you need a virgin to catch one of these? I spent a week neck deep in 4Chan for this trophy.
2861,5942,2,4,58,64,1.125,0.052231930877334055,618,"Obviously old boy, the high maintenance habits of the Barbie unicorn presented a considerably higher financial encumbrance during the sport of bagging the beast."
2384,5942,1,6,57,64,1.125,0.0472455591261534,618,I got that one behind the counter at Starbucks.
1753,5942,0,8,56,64,1.125,0.041666666666666664,618,"My broker is EF Hutton, and he says..."
2549,5942,1,6,57,64,1.125,0.0472455591261534,618,Actually the one to the left is more striking. Note it has two twisted antlers not one.
1877,5942,0,8,56,64,1.125,0.041666666666666664,618,The middle one was a victim of over-aggressive valuation.
