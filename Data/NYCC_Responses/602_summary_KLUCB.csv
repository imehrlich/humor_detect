4957,3743,2,10,44,56,1.25,0.06861335298462105,602,Made with too much sugar. He didn’t know he was dietetic.
4960,3743,1,12,43,56,1.25,0.06370589892970319,602,"Here we have an adult, gingerbread, male presenting with symptoms indicative of severe lactose intolerance..."
4970,3743,2,10,44,56,1.25,0.06861335298462105,602,"From now on, they want to be called 'gingerbread one.'"
4996,3743,0,14,42,56,1.25,0.05838742081211422,602,But that's when we heard something snap.
5024,3743,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,602,"Your ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg levels are slightly elevated, but your pituitory hormones are off the chart!"
4224,3743,1,12,43,56,1.25,0.06370589892970319,602,"You may have run, run as fast as you can, but apparently we could catch you, gingerbread man."
4680,3743,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,602,It says here you're an organ donor...
4220,3743,2,10,44,56,1.25,0.06861335298462105,602,"Before you run away again, we'd like to tell you something."
3438,3743,2,10,44,56,1.25,0.06861335298462105,602,Let's share him.
4057,3743,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,602,Preliminary tests show he's half baked but still yummy.
3129,3743,2,10,44,56,1.25,0.06861335298462105,602,Only thing that can catch him now is time
3219,3743,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,602,"It appears you've run, run, as fast as you can, into the side of a bus."
3223,3743,2,10,44,56,1.25,0.06861335298462105,602,"I'm sorry, but you're not going to get any better. Your 'Best By' date has come and gone!"
3238,3743,2,10,44,56,1.25,0.06861335298462105,602,We have determined that your running as fast as you can regimen is a recipe for disaster.
3275,3743,1,12,43,56,1.25,0.06370589892970319,602,You are looking quite inedible this morning.
3338,3743,4,6,46,56,1.25,0.07750157099371281,602,"one last request, chef - I want my crumbs to be spread over your key lime pie."

3417,3743,1,12,43,56,1.25,0.06370589892970319,602,Worst case of Gingervitis we've seen in years.
5032,3743,1,12,43,56,1.25,0.06370589892970319,602,"We're concerned about your molasses/brown suger ratio, so I've brought in some experts to consult."
3441,3743,1,12,43,56,1.25,0.06370589892970319,602,The good news is that you have tasty buttons.
4125,3743,2,10,44,56,1.25,0.06861335298462105,602,All tests are conclusive. He's definitely a sweet guy.
3523,3743,3,8,45,56,1.25,0.07319250547113999,602,"Im sorry, but you have diabetes."
3571,3743,3,8,45,56,1.25,0.07319250547113999,602,Diagnosis: burnt.
3620,3743,1,12,43,56,1.25,0.06370589892970319,602,"Based on the test results, I'm afraid that you'll have to stop running as fast as you can."
3654,3743,1,12,43,56,1.25,0.06370589892970319,602,"Although we found most of your information to be quite precise, your salt levels being ""To Taste"" will require further testing."
3677,3743,1,12,43,56,1.25,0.06370589892970319,602,"Good news you'll be here for the great bake off, bad news you'll never make it past Christmas!"
3705,3743,1,12,43,56,1.25,0.06370589892970319,602,"I'm sorry to tell you this Mr. Bread, but you're not done."
3851,3743,0,14,42,56,1.25,0.05838742081211422,602,This patient is diagnosed with excessive cinnamon overdose.
3879,3743,2,10,44,56,1.25,0.06861335298462105,602,We would like you to donate your body to be part of a gingerbread house.
3917,3743,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,602,We considered “doughy” a wholly inadequate diagnosis and appreciate your willingness to consult on this rare case.
3955,3743,1,12,43,56,1.25,0.06370589892970319,602,He threw his back out building his house.
3965,3743,1,12,43,56,1.25,0.06370589892970319,602,The operation was a success. You will now be known as Gingerbread Fluid.
3543,3743,3,8,45,56,1.25,0.07319250547113999,602,It doesn't look good. We're going to start with your head.
5186,3743,1,12,43,56,1.25,0.06370589892970319,602,"With a sugar that high, you won't be around for long!"
6230,3743,2,10,44,56,1.25,0.06861335298462105,602,"Looks like his legs were bitten off. Mix up a batch of gingerbread batter and pre-teat the oven, stat! We're need to perform emergency leg replacement baking - no cookie cutter baking here - we have to be unique and creative"
5477,3743,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,602,I think he’s just baked
6817,3743,1,12,43,56,1.25,0.06370589892970319,602,"We've decided to unplug you, then eat you."
6827,3743,3,8,45,56,1.25,0.07319250547113999,602,"The good news, you still have all your limbs."

6895,3743,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,602,No more cutting is needed. We feel if you just keep icing...
7016,3743,1,12,43,56,1.25,0.06370589892970319,602,Five more minutes at 350 then don’t call me late for dinner.
7109,3743,2,10,44,56,1.25,0.06861335298462105,602,This is not your average cookie cutter case
7165,3743,4,6,46,56,1.25,0.07750157099371281,602,"Unfortunately, re-frosting isn't covered by your plan."
7215,3743,2,10,44,56,1.25,0.06861335298462105,602,We'll just need to update your Advance Directive before we start your next heat treatment.
7230,3743,2,10,44,56,1.25,0.06861335298462105,602,"...and lastly, our kitchen staff, thrilled by the occasion of your celebrity here, wanted to know how you felt about the new apple crisp recipe."
7237,3743,3,8,45,56,1.25,0.07319250547113999,602,"Congratulations, you have successfully undergone the first trans-ginger operation."
6793,3743,3,8,45,56,1.25,0.07319250547113999,602,What we have here is an advaced case of gingervitis.
7240,3743,2,10,44,56,1.25,0.06861335298462105,602,Prognosis: Delicious
7375,3743,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,602,"The Good news is you don’t have the flu, you have a yeast infection"
7386,3743,0,14,42,56,1.25,0.05838742081211422,602,He’s allergic to ginger.
7399,3743,1,12,43,56,1.25,0.06370589892970319,602,"We can give you milk for the pain, but it may spoil your shelf-life."
7456,3743,1,12,43,56,1.25,0.06370589892970319,602,We've all decided to go in on a house.
7475,3743,0,14,42,56,1.25,0.05838742081211422,602,Your friends here think you may be suffering from a nutmeg overdose.
7484,3743,1,12,43,56,1.25,0.06370589892970319,602,"After exhaustive tasting, we feel that you need more spice in your life."
7523,3743,4,7,49,60,1.25,0.07374180027192605,602,"See what happens when you encourage a cookie to ""run as fast as you can""."
7575,3743,2,10,44,56,1.25,0.06861335298462105,602,We think that the problem is that the dish ran away with the spoon
7663,3743,1,12,43,56,1.25,0.06370589892970319,602,Yes yes we know you're not gluten free.

6672,3743,1,12,43,56,1.25,0.06370589892970319,602,"Except for Ms Sugar Cookie, this is the worst Type 2 case I’ve seen."
6619,3743,1,12,43,56,1.25,0.06370589892970319,602,"Of course, we realize now it was ‘injured head’ not ‘gingerbread’."
5517,3743,2,10,44,56,1.25,0.06861335298462105,602,He wants a gender change so we can call her Ginger Roger's.

5715,3743,3,11,54,68,1.25,0.06415178992833838,602,It's not a fever if you're supposed to be 350 degrees.
5730,3743,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,602,I’m afraid we’re going to have run run run some more tests.
5747,3743,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,602,"I'm afraid we have to do some more tastes. I mean, tests."
5864,3743,2,10,44,56,1.25,0.06861335298462105,602,Should we call you Ginger or mister Bread?
6660,3743,2,10,44,56,1.25,0.06861335298462105,602,Have you ever been told that life expectancy for gingerbread men is very low?
5952,3743,4,9,55,68,1.25,0.06748654468695238,602,"Well, it finally caught up with you."
6083,3743,1,12,43,56,1.25,0.06370589892970319,602,I see you're here for gender reassignment surgery.

658,3743,2,10,44,56,1.25,0.06861335298462105,602,I'm afraid too many cooks in the Kitchen spoiled the batter
713,3743,4,7,49,60,1.25,0.07374180027192605,602,It's a seasonal sprinkle pox.
754,3743,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,602,We're going to have to amputate both legs. But my colleagues assure me they'll be delicious.
791,3743,2,10,44,56,1.25,0.06861335298462105,602,"Seems to be a nice bake, good crumb, wonderful color but I think he's suffering from a ginger deficiency."

938,3743,1,12,43,56,1.25,0.06370589892970319,602,"He was running from the baker and his wife too, till he pulled his hamstring, and was brought to the ICU"
960,3743,4,6,46,56,1.25,0.07750157099371281,602,"I've got some bad news, Ginger. There's nothing we can do. It's just the way the cookie crumbles."

1078,3743,2,8,38,48,1.25,0.0759105483283959,602,I’m afraid you’re going to have to go back into the oven for ten minutes. You had too many cooks.
1096,3743,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,602,Since when do you feel burnt out?
1180,3743,1,12,43,56,1.25,0.06370589892970319,602,The cafeteria in this teaching hospital is a culinary school.
