Siri, how far can a hunchback jump?
I'm fine,Bob. Actually, I'm seeing a guy from Notre Dame now.
Is he religious? Mom, he’s practically a fixture at the church next door.
Did I tell you I found someone to watch the place while we're away?
Well, you know, it beats living next to Trump Tower.
I don't have the heart to tell him I'm dating the Hunchback of Temple Beth Shalom.
It is a little awkward, but on the bright side, I haven’t seen a pigeon in days.
So then he said, "What makes you think my name is Quasimodo?" And I said, "Just a hunch."
I thought his profile said he was a quarterback at Notre Dame.
No, it's not the bells that bother me.
He's annoying, but he improves my wi-fi signal. I call him my quasi-modem.
Hi, this is Esmeralda on the 9th floor. I'd like to report a peeping literary allusion.
We got the price down a little because of, what they referred to as, a quasi-obstructed view.
I can't remember his name, but his face rings a bell.
My new neighbor? Someone pretty high up in the church, I think
Well, he's not as creepy as the guy I met at the opera.
Yes Mother, I'm seeing someone!
He's single, enjoys climbing and lives right next door.
Apparently it's rent controlled and they can't get rid of him.
Gotta go, Mom. The guy's here with the cathedral.
Like I would date a guy from Notre Dame.
Okay, I checked the mail and watered the plants. What about the hunchback?
You will love him. He lives next door, he did a project with Disney a few years ago, and he's Catholic.
I want to report a squatter.
I don't know who he is but his face rings a bell.
Hello. Yes. I'd like to cancel my membership to Match.Com.
Describe him? I thought "Hunchback on church spire staring into my 10th floor condo" kinda covered it!"
Hello, ..911?......Well, it's a Quasi-emergency.
Oh Daddy, you make it sound like the city is full of weirdos.
Will you tell Mrs. Hugo in 3b to come get her husband.
There's a fat ugly troll man leering at me, high up in a tower, touching himself, and naked from the waist down. Honestly...I think he seems very presidential.
Yes, Mom, I've found someone to watch my plant while I'm away."
You know how I thought it would be neat to live next to the church with the gargoyle? It's not a gargoyle.
When they said the condo had a viewer, I thought it was a misprint.
Yes, Mom, I met him at church.
No, not Les Miz, the other French book.
Dunno for sure. Says he plays hunchback for Notre Dame.
It's not so much the staring as the no pants thing.
I can't place him, but he definitely rings a bell.
He says he's Quasimodo, but the name doesn't ring a bell.
I don't recognize him, but something about him rings a bell.
I’ve figured out why the realtor called my flat Quasimodern.
Hello, police? I'd like to report an anachronism.
Best Airbnb ever, you really get the feel of the old Paris.
No. No, not the fullback from Notre Dame.
Fifty feet or not, Boris, you're clearly violating the spirit of the restraining order!
There is a humpty taking a dumpty on the bell tower.
Yes, he is creepy. On the other hand, he keeps the pigeons off of my balcony.
I don't know who he is but somehow he rings a bell.
and Mom he studies architecture at Notre Dame.
I’d like to order a men’s XXL pajama bottom ??
No darling, I said I wanted a hatchback.
Yes, the staring is a little creepy but we no longer have a pidgeon problem.
Believe it or not, the constant ringing isn't the worst part.
Looks like my neighbor has locked himself out again.
It has a balcony, a billiards room and a stunning view of French fiction...
Yes, mother. I really am seeing someone.
No, I said please send up a Quesadilla.
No, I don't have a hunch who it is, but his face rings a bell.
My half- witted, half-naked ex thinks he can just jump right back into my life.
So...is it still OK to say "hunchback"?
I thought 'unfriending' him would be the end of it.
I tell him stalking’s no joke, but he can’t keep a straight face.
Actually, we do have a neighborhood watch.
You'll like him, ma. He's a church-goer, and he watches over me.
I said I'd sleep with him when pigs fly, and the next thing...
911 ? I’d like to report a crouching Tom.
Quasimodo is looking at my bush again.
Mom, it's more than just a hunch, he's a dead ringer.
George, can you read me the restraining order terms again?
911? I'm being watched. How do I know? Well, you could call it a hunch.
I'm not sure why he makes me nervous... just call it a hunch.
The apartment is nice, and I met my neighbor who also works at home.
...not much, just watering a plant. So what's new with you?
Describe him? He looks like Charles Laughton.
Yes, I'm serious. What's the P.C. word for 'hunchback'?
We have the world's creepiest neighborhood watch.
Building's great, but I think my neighbor is squatting.
I know how we got this unit so far below market value
Hello 911? I'd like to report a method actor.
Yeah, I'd say he's not taking the breakup well.
Sometimes you have to forego good looking for well balanced.
Good news. I've found someone to keep an eye on the place while I'm away.
I know, right? It's so unusual for someone to make eye contact today.
I want it to read 'Priced for quick sale, luxury condo in the heart of Paris; stunning cathedral view...'
The usual, watering the fern, staring down the hunchback. You?
Yeah, I know, but are you allowed to say 'Hunchback' any more?
The good news is he's stopped ringing the bell...
Apparently, there’s a religious freedom loophole in the restraining order.
His profile said he went to Notre Dame so I swiped right.
According to the lawyer, he has squatter's rights.
Yes mom, for the most part, the restraining order is working
Actually mom, I am seeing someone.
Let me call you back. The bell is about to toll and I think I am going to see some action here.
"I think you've misunderstood my request for a bellhop".
Before you call 911, I can explain.
For the last time, Mother, I live in an Upper East Side doorman building on the 17th floor. What “creeps” are going to bother me here?
… and the FBI ‘gargoyle’ still has me under covert surveillance !!!!!
Paris is great! I live across from a local celebrity!
Honey, the alumni office from Notre Dame is hounding me for a donation.
Oh, and we have the best neighborhood watch program around.
Believe it or not it's not the bells that I find intruisive...
Well, I'd describe him as your typical Caucasian male who has never been told what his limits are.
Oh and the bell isn't even the worst part.
Hello, 911? I have what you might call a "Quasi-emergency."
Well, yeah, the neighborhood has gentrified, but there's still some of the old charm left.
I think I found out why this apartment was so cheap.
I got everything in the settlement- he got squat.
No, it's not completely gentrified.
Honey? Call a bookie and bet big on Notre Dame this Saturday. Just call it a hunch.
Can I put you on hold? I think the cable guy is finally here.
I'd report him, but he actually has given me some good gardening tips.
Thanks for the offer, but I've found someone to keep any eye on the plants while I am gone.
No, mother, not so much a "boyfriend" as an "admirer." He's patient, seems well-balanced and fit, and is clearly at the top of his profession.
I had a hunch you would be back .
You DO realize I can see ypu!?
Mom, I'll call you back. Jeff Sessions is lurking outside the window again.
I think I have a stalker, but it's just a hunch.
They did say it was a quasi-obstructed view...
I thought quasi view meant just sort of.
I don't remember his name but his face sure rings a bell
No, I've never seen him before. But, his face rings a bell.
Yeah, it looks like Trump is mocking the handicapped again.
I see Victor's off his meds again.
I'm still waiting for him to make the first move.
I thought they said "quasi-MODERN"
I don't care if it's smaller. If the unit's two floors up I'll take it.
Just tell the priest that little Donald got out again.
Yeah Linda, we're gonna be a little late. I can't get his pants on, let alone shoes and socks.
Look, I'm way too busy to talk down every hunchback who's about to jump, okay?
Don’t worry, Mother. The guy I’m seeing goes to church every day.
Father Frollo? It's Esmeralda. He's at it again.
I called the police about him, but they say he has sanctuary...
He's not a stalker or a peeper...I'd call him more of a squatter.
On the other hand, he is French.
I thought that I would be safe dating a guy from church.
Yes it is a big jump from Gothic to Modern, but I think he's ready for a new aesthetic.
When did 'gargoyling' become a thing?
Let's pray he doesn't take a leap of faith.
Millie, I think I now know for Whom the Bell Tolls.
I think I've finally found someone to watch my plants when I'm out of town.
...And he really seems to be on the ball.
Jackie, do you know how far a hunchback can jump?
I am seeing someone, Mom — and he’s at the very top of his profession.
Now that you ask, his face does ring a bell.
I'm waiting for him to make the first move"
'Things are good. Benny got accepted into Notre Dame.'
Of course I really didn't mean to swipe right, but now what do I do with him?
Mom, guess what? The bell tolling is not the creepiest part of living here.
No Victor, it's not the bell that I mind so much...
On the other hand, he is French.
When I asked him if he remembers how he got up there he said "nothing rings a bell".
Turns out the worst part of living next to a bell tower isn't the noise.
I'm pretty sure he's single.
Paris is great, mom...no, I haven't met anyone yet...well, there is this one guy.
My neighbor is single, into music and goes to church."
yes mother, im seeing a nice Catholic boy
You won't believe what Sean Spicer's doing these days.
He says at one time he could see all of Paris. Then they built these damn apartments.
Yes officer, I am sure it's not a downspout.
Siri, how do you say, it's not you, it's me, in French?
This wasn't what I thought when they told me the bell boy would give me free wake up calls in the morning.
Well, it's just not what I had in mind when the Airbnb listing mentioned a classically gothic view with Parisian undertones.
Wait a minute, that gargoyle looks a little like Harvey Weinstein.
The new apartment's great, Mom! The neighborhood watch is a little intense, though.
Esmeralda here ... yes, that Bell Ringer is back again. Would it kill the Archbishop to buy him a pair of pants?
He keeps calling me Esmeralda and saying he plays half-back for Notre Dame.
Please give me the library reference desk. I'd like to report a literary illusion.
Just my luck to rent a room with a viewer.
Oh nothing much, just out on the balcony watering my plant and watching a hunchback balance on top of the cathedral.
Yeah, he's just like all the rest, afraid to make the big leap.
And why can’t Cirque du Soleil do something about controlling their people when they’re in town?
It's great except for the guy in the church next door who wouldn't sell to the developer.
The French doors are lovely, but I assumed 'hugo balcony & view" was a typo.
The new apartment? It's ok. I've got a quasi view from the balcony.
Nothing much, you?
Hey Weinstein, the woman getting out of the shower is two floors down.
Thanks for calling back Donald. I’ve a hunch that Notre Dame is taking a knee.
Did I tell you that Harvey Weinstein now has a place in our neighborhood?
No, I’m not being paranoid about my neighbor. Call it a hunch.
Yeah, you're gonna have to give me another clue, he looks familiar but still not ringing any bells...
Remember we thought a pigeon did that?
Yes, officer, you'll find him at the base of the bell tower. He'll be holding a potted plant.
Wow! Honey, what did you put in those brownies?
Actually, he does ring a bell.
This is Esmeralda, Quasimodo is violating his restraining order again.
Not much, you?
Yeah, I have a hunch he's back.
He says his name is Harvey and he can put me in the movies.
Meanwhile, any bell ringer from France can get a work visa, apparently.
He claims he can ring my bell.
I know we said 'we'll always have Paris,' but I think we've had it long enough.
When I say he’s on the ball, it’s not a good thing.
The only downside is that my view is quasi-obstructed.
Hello maintenance, I changed my mind. I don't mind the pigeons anymore.
No Mom, he's just another social climber.
Excuse me...can you toss over some toilet paper?
I don't know who he is but his face rings a bell.
Let me call you back, these Airbnb visitors are out of control.
No, not a CELL tower after all. Much, much worse.
Yes the view looks like a Disney movie, just not the one I envisioned.
He just doesn't seem ready to make the leap.
He's fallen for me. Or he will.
I'm sorry Brad, I'm currently seeing someone.
No, no officer, it's OK. He only does this to watch the Notre Dame games on our big screen TV.
Did you hear Steve Bannon bought a place in the neighborhood?
Please tell me this violates the restraining order.
I've already told him it's St. Patrick's not Notre Dame.
He's my Quasi-roommate.
I see they finally filled that gargoyle position.
Can I call you back?, my 3 o'clock appointment just arrived..
Yes, that's right, the lotus position. Should I be concerned?
Hold on a second, I'm about to witness a great leap of faith.
Weinstein's staring at me again.
"Unobstructed views of Central Park" my ass...
Just finishing up with the plants, then it's off to the gym. Bye bye for now, and of course the Q-ster says hi.
..so my realtor said "Esmeralda, I have JUST the condo for you!"
Fred's gargoyling again, mom.
It's a cute corner unit with a quasi-view of the city.
Excuse me ma’am, what’s the wifi password?
Rent's not bad but it's got a quasi-obstructed view.
Be that as it may, you violated the spirit of real estate disclosure.
Somehow I just keep attracting the wrong kind of guy.
No, I swiped left but he's still here.
I just have to water the plant and feed Quasimodo. I meet you downstairs in 5 min.
I didn't think balcony-grown cannabis would be this powerful.
How much extra will you charge me to have those curtains delivered overnight?
Hey,off subject,but is Jeff Sessions Catholic?
We love Paris. We just didn't know it was a sanctuary city.
It's another one of those leaping Toms.
No, not in a good way. But he does look presidential.
I keep telling him.."I'm not your Dame"
I know, I know.....but let me ask you, where else can I get a one bedroom with a terrace in a doorman building at this rent?
He's creepy, but his balance is incredible.
You're right, I never should have said, "come up and see me sometime."
No, actually, I think he was here first.
Well I suppose I could change the ring tone, but it’s so cute how quick he comes.
Have you considered a laxative?
He is French, has a steady job, and makes excellent eye contact!
Yes, and I can actually enjoy the balcony again thanks to the city's aggressive pigeon control program.
This explains why the Cardinal wasn't surprised at my last confession.
No, Officer. I don't know for sure that the Peeping Tom's name is Quasimodo, it is just a hunch.
I love Paris, apart from the locals
Ugh, Trump Jr. is watching me water my plants again.
The view is like something out of a book.
The pigeons are gone but the cuckoos are back.
He said he's a hunchback for Notre Dame but he doesn't look anything like a football player if you ask me.
I had a hunch he'd be back.
He's kinda cute, but I prefer the quarterback of Notre Dame.
He says his name is Quasimodo. Rings a bell ?
What's my boyfriend do? He's highly placed in the church.
Pardon me. Do you have any Grey Poupon?
Good God, he's now trying his Charles Laughton imitation.
Believe it or not, his looks aren't his biggest problem.
Hey, remember that French guy we met last night?
I don't know, Marty. What kind of 'good explanation' could there be?
I’m not sure, but his face rings a bell.
Housing Authority? The building across from me has a squatter.
Yeah . . . he's still tolling for me.
Mom, you know that guy I met in church I said was a little obsessive? Well, uh...
They call it a Quasi-city view.
Why do I think that I'm being stalked? Just a hunch.
I found Dad.
Yes, hi. I'd like to report a peeping gargoyle.
No, he's still there. He thinks I'm quasi-interested in him.
Yeah, I know he inspired a musical but he's creeping me out.
Apparently trying to leave the Church is getting really dangerous.
Actually, he's not as irritating as that creep downstairs who uses a mirror on a stick.
Hi ... yes, I’d like to report a peeping-quasimodo.
Sorry, you jumped over there, you can just jump right back.
I have to go, my neighbor just rang.
You know how we thought it'd be kinda cool to look at that old church next door?
As if those bells every Sunday morning weren't bad enough.....
Oh, I have to go. Someone just rang the bell.
…but I’m sure his Tinder profile said he was a “halfback from Notre Dame!!!”
Hang on Esmeralda, I'll just put you on speakerphone.
They sold it to him as a one bedroom with a view.
It's kind of creepy but he does leave at the top of every hour.
"THAT'S what I thought, but he swears his name is Phil.
He's back, but I'm trying to ignore him.
The new place is great. The neighborhood has a quasi-Paris vibe.
Sorry, this is not a sanctuary city.
No, he's just asking for the name of a good spinal surgeon.
Yes, he's really on the ball.
It's good to see we're still a sanctuary city.
To tell you the truth, the restraining order is worthless.
I don't recognize his face, but the name rings a bell.
He says his name is Quasimodo. Does that ring a bell with you?
My new neighbor's a halfback for Notre Dame.
The broker did say it had classic views.
Police? I'd like to report a squatter.
Do I know who the peeper is? Well, I have a hunch.
He can jump if he want's, I don't think he can make it.
And he has his own place.
Looks like six more weeks of winter.
Nothing much, what's up with you?
Sorry officer, I don't know his name, but his face does ring a bell
Yeah I'm pretty sure my ex is crazier
Excuse me ma'am, do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior, Jesus Christ?
No, it doesn't ring a bell.
Come on, one giant leap for mankind
I paid for an unobstructed view.
Look, it's San Francisco. I have to be interested in any guy who's interested in me.
I have to go. My 3 o’clock is here.
The guy next door is a total Victor Hugo fan boy.
No, I'm in the Quasimodern building next door
It's OK. He can't hear me.
Yes, 911, my uncle was practicing his Parkour, but he's gotten himself stuck on top of the church again.
I’m quasi-sure it’s him
Yes, in fact I am the one who called earlier about the bells ...
No bell tower, but we do have cathedral ceilings.
I gotta call you back, my French teacher's here.
I don't care if chiropractically challenged is the correct nomenclature. Just come and stop him from staring in my windows.
Unfortunately, he has squatter's rights.
I think he wants to take a leap of faith.
Hold on a sec, my neighbor wants to borrow a cup of sugar.
Watering a plant while being stalked. You?
Well...he's French...
You'll never guess what Spider-Man dressed up as for Halloween this year.
Harold has been acting kind of weird since our separation last month.
I do sympathize, it's just that this apartment was supposed to be *my* sanctuary.
Security? I know he's on the historical registry, but it's still creepy.
It's odd. Every time I water the plants, the bells stop.
I'm hoping he doesn't make a leap of faith.
I haven't officially met the neighbor yet, but his face rings a bell.
I can't recall his name but his face sure rings a bell...
Well, can he claim sanctuary if he is ON the cathedral?
But, on the plus side, my French is improving.
At least he stopped ringing the bell.
He could be Jewish, I suppose. He just works there.
It's not growing fast enough--I can still see him.
There is one guy I know who would jump at the chance to meet me
No, he's nice. And we made a deal. I'll water his fern and he'll pour boiling pitch on the downstairs neighbor.
When they said the neighbor was also a Notre Dame grad; I just made a wrong assumption.
Quasimodo's on top of it.
You’re overwatering again.
You wouldn't believe it, but I've found an apartment with outside space and my own personal gargoyle!
I would to report a Pooping Tom outside my window.
I found him on that new dating website - Stalker.
Oh yeah, and some treats for the gargoyle.
I'm pretty sure it's a zoning violation
Despite appearances to the contrary, Jill was convinced the man peeping on her was not a well balanced individual.
The view? It's Quasi decent.
I'd like to report a peeping homme.
He can't come to the phone right now.
More like quasi-creepy.
By any chance, do you have any toilet paper?
No, not too pricey, but it’s only quasi-gentrified.
Yes, it's good to be back from my trip to Paris. But... somehow I feel as though I never left...
Pardon me, Miss. Could you throw me some toilet paper?
Hmm... if you're looking for classics to read, try the works of Victor Hugo, his books just seem to come to life.
What's French for "Sorry, but Essie turned this into an Airbnb"?
I'll have to call you back. Something's just come up.
Hello, reception? I think you sent up the wrong bellman.
Well, he's attentive, a fabulous musician and has his own place.
That does it,I've got to change my internet dating service
Well, Mom, this new guy I'm seeing is at the peak of his profession.
Hi Doris, looks like the "steeple peeper" is at it again.
I love my new place but I feel like I’m being watched.
I'm only Quasi-interested in him.
No, I would say he's total modo.
'Hunchback' is offensive, Todd. He's a deplorable.
I got a hunch our new neighbors are French.
He says he’s the quarterback of Nortre Dame.
This is Esmeralda up in 1505. I think I have a problem.
Yes I should have paid for the higher floor.
No, he can't make the leap, he's only a quasi modo!
Esmeralda, that football player from Notre Dame is here looking for you again.
That's the problem, you feed them once and they keep coming back.
No, no. I said LUNCH PACK.
That's right: athletic, persistent, distinctive features, hunchback. Ring a bell?
No, I didn't say the quarterback of Notre Dame..."
Please book me in for Dr. Ziegler — I’ll need him to increase my dosage.
Finally a neighbor I can see eye to eye with.
You were right about quirkyblinddate.com.
The realtor told me about the bells, but not about this guy.
He's a little odd, but I do like the attention.
I like it here OK but my neighbor is a little creepy.
May I use your bathroom ?
It's a long story.
Gotta go. My Tinder date just showed up.
I think I know what happened to that "funny" kid in high school.
Okay, now do you believe I love you?
Well, at least when he’s on the steeple, he’s not ringing that damn bell.
Esmeralda, I have a trivia question for you. How far can a hunchback jump?
Wow...just last week he was a big-time movie producer.
I don't know who he is, but he rings a bell.
I think he's a squatter.
Your hunch was right. He's back.
Yes, I think we are a 'sanctuary city'.
Your buzzer doesn't work
The view is Quasi-obstructed.
Honestly, my new priest seems a little too concerned when I miss a Sunday.
Esmeralda, this is the last time I apartment-sit for you.
I could swear the agent said, "View of quads at MoMA."
Did I see anything unusual today? What do you mean by unusual?
I mean, why not try ringing the doorbell, once in a while?
I'm not sure how but he improves my cellphone reception.
Oh nothing serious, just a hunch
I am really fine Mom, the medicine has only mild visual side effects
I dunno. Maybe it's a little TOO near St. Patrick's.
The neighbors are quasi-friendly.
Hunchback Thursdays are starting to bore me.
Your hunch was right. He's back.
Yes, you did say the view would make me feel like I was in Paris, but still!
You know that time I accidentally swiped right?
No! I didn't say Halfback of Notre Dame...
Only a hunch, but possibly front page news.
These internet trolls are getting more brazen every day.
And this pose is called 'Crouching Gargoyle'. It's very good for your back.
He says he's a back for Notre Dame.
Ma, all the good men are either gay, married, or afraid of heights
I wish I would have paid more attention in my high school French class.
I'd like to report a peeping and very agile Tom.
I'd like to report an historic anomaly....
The new place? It's mostly great, except the view is just kind of quasi okay.
I'll have to call you back, there is another squatter attempting a leap of faith.
Not much new here. We've still got silverfish, and that hunchback staring from the top of the cathedral next door.
I don't know him, but he rings a bell.
He just keeps saying how much he wants to ring my bell.
The neighborhood watch is really on the ball here.
His profile said he was the real deal, but now I find out he's just quasi-modo.
It said condo with a view, not condo with a viewer.
When we got the news that Adam was being scouted by one of the higher-ups at Notre Dame, this wasn’t what I envisioned.
Gotta go. That French guy is outside again.
Well, he's rent-controlled, for one thing. A mob couldn't get him out of there.
You're blocking my view.
No, I'm not being dramatic. He watches me like a hawk.
And if that isn't creepy enough, he kinda looks like Harvey Weinstein.
Perhaps he will be gone in a little while. But, I have a hunch he'll be back.
I have complained. Apparently they included the hunchback when the church was declared a landmark.
Mom, it's no big deal. I'll just get some pajamas or curtains.
He's not very attractive, but he's quite a swinger.
No mom, he’s not really dangerous, he’s just quasi-creepy.
He says his name is 'Quasimodo,' which doesn't ring a bell with me.
At least I've gotten him to stop ringing the damn bell.
This brings stalking to a whole new height!
They finally found a renter for that 27-story walk-up.
Esmeralda, do I have the guy for you. I'll have him give you a ring.
I can’t recall his name, but his face rings a bell.
He's asking if we are a sanctuary condo.
Mom, relax. This place has a great Neighborhood Watch program.
On the upside, it's got a view of the cathedral.....
Yes, I'd like to report a gargoyle.
I'm just going to water it from now on, smoking it is creeping me out.
I think he's trying to hit on me. Just a hunch.
The new Hunchback ringtone is unbelievably real.
You'll never guess who moved in next door.
I really wish my parents hadn't named me Esmeralda.
I love the apartment, but the view is a bit Gothic for my taste.
Unfortunately, he's landmarked.
'Jerry, about that 'not needing curtains' idea you had...'
He's not taking the breakup very well.
It needs some fertilizer.
Yeah, well I'm quasi-sick-of-it!
Hi, Your Grace. It's Steffi. Your Hunchback is staring at me again.
I'd say outside of our place, the neighborhood is more french gothic.
As a matter of fact I am seeing someone new, and he really knows how to ring my bell.
He says he heard this is a sanctuary city.
Yes, Police? He says he is staying until Trump resigns.
My Tinder date is here, he looks like a good hump.
Hey lady, do you know how many condo rules you're violating ?
Yeah, Mom, I know I'm a millenial. But I still know what King Kong looks like.
The neighborhood has gone downhill since we became a sanctuary city.
Yes, please send up 5 quarts of WD-40 and one SuperSoaker.
Yeah, he's right here in front of me, contemplating a leap of faith.
I don’t know...His face doesn’t ring a bell.
Yes officer, this is Esmeralda. Quasimodo is stalking me again.
Do you have any toilet paper?
He keeps saying he wants to ring my bell.
Hello, 911? I think Harvey Weinstein is perched outside my window.
It's not how I pictured my fairy tale romance.
No I don't recognize him but I do have a hunch.
These Jehovah’s witnesses are becoming more aggressive
Got any toilet paper?
Sis, do we live in a sanctuary city?
One second, I think the president escaped.
No, Mom, I never said that my new boyfriend was a half-back at Note Dame.
I take it back. He’s doing a full modo.
You're right. I needed to be a couple of floors up for privacy.
He can't tell if he is interested in me or just wants to hang out.
Sure, I hoped I'd meet a man in Paris. He's not quite what I expected, though.
I have to go. The "sensitive, fun loving, bell ringer" that I met online, is about to hop in.
It's called gargoyling
No, I'm not seeing him anymore, but he's still seeing a lot of me.
Hey, remember that ogre we met in St. Bart’s?
Yeah. It's Gary the gargoyle from downstairs again . . . I know . . . What a jerk.
I think I need to change my ringtone.
You could have just taken the elevator you know
I hear that Harvey Weinstein is doing a remake of King Kong.
I dunno. I just don't have the heart to tell him they cancelled the musical's Broadway run.
I don't know...he's more of a semi-modo.
Well, I don't exactly feel threatened. He's more of a "quasi" stalker.
"Yeah he's here, his phone ran out of minutes, hang on a sec"!
Happy hump day, by the way.
Well, he rings my bell and lives nearby.
'He's not taking your place, dear; he's only my quasi boyfriend."
It's rent controlled!
He says he wants to ring my chimes.
Siri, how far can steeple dwelling bell ringers jump?
Honey, could you stand up, I think my coverage is better when you stand!
Esmeralda, I think he wants to talk to you.
This arrondissement has really gentrified the past couple hundred years.
He said the bell tolls for me.
I don't mind the staring. It's that damn bell he rings every hour that makes me want to break my lease.
I'm not sure the east facing balcony was such a deal afterall.
Who is he? I'm not sure, but I've got a hunch.
I have a hunch the neighbors are religious.
I'll tell you this much, mom--he's the strong silent type, super athletic, and has reached the top position where he works.
You know, very few people make it to our level.
Well, it's kind of flattering that a peeping tom would go to so much trouble ...
Oh, not much really. I've got Quasimodo balancing on a church steeple peering into my kitchen at the moment. What's new with you?
I've told you before - you really MUST get proper toilets installed in the cathedral.
I hope he is just a peeper and not a leaper.
I'm seeing someone right now who's at the top of his profession.
He’s musical, speaks French, isn’t afraid of heights, and loves flowers.
Apparently, the civil war monuments are being replaced by confederate performance art.
THIS bell was NOT tolling for thee! It's my phone, the call was for me.
Hard to say if it's a gargoyle or peeping Tom.
He's a gargoyle, but I don't mean that in a negative way.
Yes officer, I'm quite sure it's not a giant ape.
Of course I have a hunch who it is.
Gotta go. Bell rang. Guy from the church next door wants something.
Ever since we became a sanctuary city we’ve had all sort of novel characters appearing....
Look Mom, we all knew a Michigan-Notre Dame marriage would get a little stressful on game day...
Would you date someone who insists calling you Esmeralda?
Nothing new here, darling
I’m telling you, it’s so much healthier since my neighbor started talking to it.
He's, like, modo-ish. Sortamodo. Kindamodo.
Gotta go, my date just rang the bell.
Well, yes he seems a bit strange, but anything is better than the last guy. He was just "Miserable"!
We prefer spinally enhanced, Mother.
I'd say he's about a hop, skip, and jump away.
Yeah, send one with a big ladder. He's stuck up there again.
Sometimes Cupid throws you a curve.
My neighbors are quasi-normal
He does it the middle of every week ever since he over heard me say Wednesday is hump day
This is why we need more public toilets.
He's not very good looking, but he's on the ball!
Remember that fairytale honeymoon I was promised?
Yeah. I know why the bells aren't ringing.
When they said it had a 'Parisian feel' this wasn't what I had in mind.
Quasi wants to know what time you want the alarm set for tomorrow.
You won’t believe this, but there is a guy sitting on top of the bell tower who isn’t wearing pants.
The hunchback who notices dames
I’m going to have to call you back, I’ve been challenged to a staring contest.
Personally,I find the bell ringing more disturbing.
Mom, you'll like him. He's a Music major from Notre Dame.
He worked so hard to get there, I hate to report him!
Claude? It's Agnes. He's at it again.
The view is nice, but the neighbors are quasi creepy.
It's not so bad, they let me ring the bell.
I hate hump day.
I can't remember his name, but his face rings a bell.
Height? I can't even guess.
Yes, 911? I think he's about to take a leap of faith...
Hugo says ‘Hi’.
Hold on, Quasimodo wants to Facetime.
He says he knows you, Esmeralda. Does that ring a bell?
Same old, same old, a little shopping, water the plants, stare down the peeping gargoyle neighbors
Just a creepy peeping tom. What's happening with you?
I've been thinking about moving.
Hello St. Catherine's? Your hunchback is peeking through my window again.
Maybe a stalker, maybe a jumper. All I know is he's blocking our view of the Seine.
He's asking if this is a sanctuary city.
'Hmm ... not exactly. More like quasi-Quasimoto."
I would call this more of a Quasi-gentrified neighborhood.
I love my new place. The view is so gothic.
The view? I'd say more Gothic than Romanesque.
No, Mom, he's not exactly like my old boyfriend Modo. He's quasi-modo.
Mrs. Laughton? Yes, he did it again.
I hate hump day.
He's screaming SANCTUARY - are we democrats?
There's this guy out there asking me if he can borrow some molten lead."
I can't tell if he's a real Modo or just a Quasimodo.
How far do you think Quasimodo can jump?
I think I need to move to a higher floor.
No, Honey, it's not Trump or Weinstein.
What time is it? Hold on, Mary. Let me ask this guy over here.
It's just a hunch.
Yes Officer, but as peeping-toms go, this one deserves a medal.
He seems nice, but I can't see it ending happily.
Mother, I don't think Eric is taking his medicine.
I'm still single, but I gotta hunch who likes me.
He calls me Esmeralda and I give him water. It's like that cartoon.
Sheriff, this is Esmerelda, he's doing it again.
Yes mother, I do happen to have a new suitor and he’s very attentive.
Mother please, resoureful or not, he is not husband material.
I love my new place! It comes with a vieux.
We met online. He's not perfect but, with a little work I think I can straighten him out.
I'd call it a quasi-good view.
I told him not to worry, this is a sanctuary city.
He's sort of a quasi-stalker.
Well the best description is that he looks uncannily like Eric Trump.
Nature vs Percher
is this weed any good?!?! Im hallucinating just watering it!!!
Can I call you later? It's time to feed the Hunchback.
Hi Mom. Nothing new. Just sent Billy out to play.
I have a hunch backing out of my lease will be easy
NOT SURE WHY BUT, I FEEL LIKE I'M IN A QUASI-RELATIONSHIP.
That's just Goodell checking whether we stand for the anthem.
I have a hunch, but can you describe him?
I have a hunch that this will become a problem
Yes officer, his face rings a bell.
Well, he does looks like his profile picture but when he said he was athletic, this isn't what I expected.
I don't know. Some creep who says he used to play quarterback for Notre Dame.
My realtor did say the locals were resistant to change.
I would like to report a leaping Tom.
That reminds me, is Notre Dame in the Final Four?
As a matter of fact, my neighborhood is actually quite diverse.
All that money, Donald, for the air rights above the cathedral, and that is the best you can do?
It's a hideous French Gothic, but I can't talk now. The owner's right here.
I've been quasi-seeing someone.
I don't know. But his face rings a bell.
Monsignor ,this is Martha across the way, he's at it again .
He says he's looking for Sanctuary. Isn't that next to the omakase place in Brooklyn?
..oh, not much, just watering the plants and staring at the local hunchback. What's new with you?
That's why it's called a leap of faith
I've got my first trick or treater!
I told him goth guys aren't my type, but he's not hearing me.
No, it is clearly not a peregrine falcon building a nest.
It's so cool, I found out we're both Notre Dame fans.
I have a question about the 'sanctuary city' designation.
The squatters are getting a lot bolder in the neighborhood!
My realtor told me the place had "old world charm." I wish he had been more specific.
I have a hunch.
...yes officer. He keeps asking, Desdemona? And I keep insisting that it's a begonia.
Yes, officer.. I would describe him as a dumb eyed, badly shorn, sighing circle steeple sitter.
Yeah, so this stupid plant seems to be coming back. Ok, weird question: do you know if hunchbacks can jump?
His face rings a bell
He's Catholic, but I don't think birth control will be a problem.
I fed him once and now I can't get rid of him.
I’ve got a hunch I’m being watched
Hold on, my voyeur's back.
Yes, he's really on the ball.
And... pepper spray.
And he thinks I'm going to like him just because my name's Esmeralda.
No no, I asked for a HALFBACK!
He did say the remodel was going to be mid-century.
I'm growing a privacy hedge.
At least he stopped ringing the bell at all hours.
You know, the music was loud at the club and I thought he said he was the quarterback at Notre Dame...
Is that you Esmeralda?
Oh, it's just a hunch I have.
What do you mean how do I know it's hump day?
Sorry but I clearly ordered a hatchback for our children's game, not a hunchback of Notre Dame.
Don't they have a ledge in Wall street for that kind of thing?
" This may be a good time to speak to him about those damn bells".
I think you'll genuinely like this guy - he's really, really goth.
I said we would meet at church choir, not spire.
This gives a whole new meaning to the expression "leap of faith!"
It's amazing, I had wondered if watering a plant this high up could attract birds - you'll never guess what's perched on the bell tower next door.
Some troll is protesting the Anthem.
Professor Kay, this is Jodie from your art history class. One more time, what's the difference between a gargoyle and a grotesque?
On the other hand, I never have to set my alarm.
This is not the Parisian view I signed up for.
Hi Mom. Yeah, so you know how you told me to give that odd looking Catholic boy a glass of water the other day. I'm getting the sense he's the clingy type.
It's Esmeralda. I think I'm being stalked.
One of these days I will meet someone who is determined, courageous, and a bit of a daredevil.
As gargoyles go, he's pretty unthreatening.
No, I'm not surprised by it. We are a sanctuary city after all.
This guy has a lot of balls.
Yeah, the guy from last Wednesday. The pepper spray didn’t reach.
HelloParis,I'd like your lost and found department
Yes, hi. I'd like my deposit back. You explicitly said he would remain inside the bell tower.
It's a funny thing - I didn't know that there was a monument to Victor Hugo in our neighborhood.
Actually, he is a well-balanced guy, but everything else in his profile is a crock.
Just wondering. Do you ever read the classics?
Well, I guess he didn't read the part about staying 500 feet away from a church or school...
I'd term him special needs with a literate background.
Actually, he looks exactly like his Tinder picture.
Could I please have the number for the Paris archdiocese?
I want to report an illegal squatter.
He's not taking the break-up well, Esmeralda.
He has taken the act of being a peeping tom to new heights.
Hi, Mom? I'm pretty sure I'm being stalked, but its just a hunch.
Gotta go. My parkour coach is here.
My boyfriend wants to know if the Irish beat the spread.
Hold on, Arthur forgot his keys again
Hold on, the pervert of Notre-Dame is here again.
Yes, I know, and I've told him a thousand times, "Your posture is going put a hunch in your back." Men. I bet he's not hearing a word I say.
Honey, I gotta go, there's a church guy staring at me
You're taking stalking to new heights.
Well, Mom, the good news is that he goes to church, and he's far more interested in me than I am in him.
I have a hunch that he's back.
He likes New York well enough, but sometimes he gets homesick for his old place.
When the realtor said the place had a quasi view, it definitely wasn't what I had in mind.
It wasn’t here this morning, so I’m beginning to think it’s not a gargoyle at all.
There's just one small problem: he's French.
He says to tell you this is no longer a sanctuary city.
You’re gonna love him. He’s French!
I don't know, but he kinda looks like your ex.
Mom, but he's a musician with a fulltime job and housing.
I don't understand how he knew I was having an affair.
He's like my quasi-neighbor.
Help! I've gotten up and I can't fall down!
That's too much water. Trust me, I have a hunch about these things.
Hold on a second. The delivery man's here.
I'm tired of quasi-relationships.
Oh, just another downside of living on Avenue Victor Hugo.
Whatever happened to secret admirers?
Quasi, it's for you.
That name rings a bell.
But how do I tell if he's the Disney or the Hugo version?
Oh, by the way, do you happen to know if Notre Dame won today?
Did someone named Esmeralda live here before?
He's had a hard time giving me space since the breakup.
Now I have a hunch why this apartment was so cheap.
Hang on, someone else is ringing me.
Actually, the word is "gargoyle"
I don’t know if he’s *the* hunchback, but he’s definitely *a* hunchback of Notre Dame, and you’ll need to send the fire department.
I could fertilize that for you.
Don’t worry Harold, I won’t get water on your precious building.
Josh left me again, and this time he's blaming the church.
I dunno... I'd say he's quasi-creepy.
He wants to know if this is a sanctuary city.
No, not quesadilla, Quasimodo!
Hold on I think I may have found a date.
I would say we have a quasi relationship.
My ex has gone to great lengths to continue stalking me.
Hi honey, quick question. How far can a hunchback long jump?
Do you want some water?
honey, have you noticed the new gargoyle on the cathedral?
Yeah, parkour, all weekend... This one's just not moving along, though.
The Nosy Hunchback of Notre Dame.
Just a hunch, but I think I'm being watched.
He's back.......Listen, I'm putting you on speaker you tell him.
Esmeralda? It's him again. I had a hunch he'd be back.
I'm thinking the hump isn't enough of a counterbalance.
Weird, he just stares and calls me Esmeralda.
I have a hunch the neighborhood association will have something to say about this.
It's just a hunch, but I think he's a voyeur.
Same old story: his Tinder photo looked a lot better.
He's either taking a crap or he took one.
Nothing new here, how about you?
How do you say 'I'm calling the cops' in French?
Yeah, we bought in an older building, but like our realtor said, at least the neighborhood is quasi-modern.
I think you’re overwatering.
I think he asked me out, but my ears were ringing.
say, I think I have a secret admirer
He's lost his keys again.
Even squatters are having a hard time finding space around here.
I wish that creepy girl next door would stop watching me.
I'm telling you, this guy's really on the ball.
He says his name is Quasimodo, and even though I tell him my name is Helen, he keeps calling me Esmeralda!
Officer, there's a pantsless man on a tower outsi-- no not that tower sir.
He says he's a halfback or something so maybe it's a protest.
911? I'm calling to report that a gargoyle has come to life and is trying to look in my windows, and no, I'm not just some New York nut job.
No, but his face rings a bell.
I haven't been to the church yet, but the new preacher looks interesting.
Yes, police, there's a creepy guy staring at me right now. Yes the one hundredth third floor.
Quasimodo had to step out for a minute. May I take a message?
If the bells weren't bad enough, now I've got a peeping hunchback!
We met on Tumblr...I'd say we're quasi-dating.
Don't worry, Mom. The city is like a Disney movie.
Mom, I know you told me to move to a higher floor to keep the Peeping Toms away, but one guy is really persistent!
The bells are not as big a problem as you would think.
He's literally staring at me.
Hello, is this Notre-Dame Cathedral. I found the hunchback.
You seriously need to learn to Skype!
I'm glad we paid extra for the authentic French view
Did you lose your keys again?
No Barb, haven’t told him yet... I just don’t think it’s going to go well.
He’s doing it again. I tossed him my chiropractor’s card.
the chiropractor is one floor up.
"Why don't I think this date is gonna work out?" I don't know. Probably just a hunch...
I have to call you back. The super's finally here.
Whoever this Esmeralda is, she has a serious stalker.
His face rings a bell
All I said was "what would it take to get you to stop ringing that bell every hour?".
Officer, his face rings a bell...
That creepy guy from church is here again.
Notre Dame at Miami.
Same ol' same ol'. How about you?
I had a hunch he was back
I'm watering my neighbors plant while he's at church
My view is just crazy.
I hear he bought the air rights in the 80s...
I dunno but his face rings a bell.
I'll take the creeps over pigeons any day.
What should I do? I've never been trolled in person before.
No, not all the time. Just when the phone rings.
Sorry to bother you, ma'am, but would you like to buy some Gargoyle Scout cookies?
I think he's a squatter.
I'm getting a stalker vibe, but he insists it's a Neighborhood Watch Program.
You'll like him. He's got a kind of Charles Laughton / Anthony Quinn / Mandy Patinkin vibe.
It's modern, but with old world charm.
Well, he's church-going... and extremely stable... but not your typical boy-next-door type at all. You'll like him.
And after all these years, we met through my chiropractor.
I want to report a peeping Quasimodo.
He takes Halloween very seriously.
No Mom, I don't think I should I should give him a chance.
He says he’d like a drink, and to hang out
Once you’ve been to Paris, it’s always with you
I kinda regret we became a sanctuary city.
I think I know why this place was so cheap.
In Europe, you know if it's a Catholic or a Protestant church by if there's a rooster or a cross on its top. But I'm not sure here.
Hi deacon, it's Esmeralda. He's on the roof again.
Hello, Ashley Madison? I'd like to cancel my trial membership.
Did you know NYU even had a hunchback?!
Quasimodo? No, sorry -- that name doesn't ring a bell.
Maybe we should stop meeting like this
I've got a hunch about this guy I'm seeing!
Yes Officer, I caught him trying to ...well water my plant from afar, please hurry
Harvey Weinstein's new job is a gargoyle.
Igor, I think you'd be more effective in your new job if you stood up straight and held your arms out.
Gotta go, my ride's here.
I would say the view from my balcony is Quasi good.
He's a moron, on top, but no comb-over
I have a hunch who’s been calling me in the middle of the night.
Same sh#t, different day. How about you?
Well, he's better looking than a gargoyle.
OK, Mom, but if he jumps over, I 'll know he's serious.
No, you heard me right: a gargoy.
It looks like the Peeping Tom of Notre Dame is back.
Peeping Lon.
Jump? Hugo First.
No, ‘he rings Our Lady's bell’ isn't a euphemism.
Just my luck to be stuck next to a church that provides sanctuary to peeping Toms.
I think I liked the incessant bell ringing more than the leering stares.
I agree, that was the best mushroom pizza I've ever had.
Just a hunch. Back to you.
You won't believe the trick I just taught him!
Not much...Oh...they just installed a new weather vane on the church.
Hello, Rid-A-Troll?
Trust me Officer, he's "high"!
Okay, Esmeralda, I'll tell him.
No mobile? Ring the big bell next time. I will come down.
Yeah, he's creepy, but the realtor promised me that he can't clear the jump.
Oh, I'm just watching another weird world record being broke.
Look officer, I don't know much about football but this guy keeps saying he played hunchback at Notre Dame.
I’m suing the seller for non-disclosure.
Notre Dame de la Gentrification.
I think I need to stop using dating apps
This is a sanctuary city, so I said yeah, fine whatever.
Yeah, I see him. I just don't think he's my type...
I think I need a taller plant.
It was either this or a brick wall.
The restraining order expired.
I knocked twice on the pipe Mom, but he's still there.
Ah, what the hell... Swipe right.
Hump. I said hump, not hunk.
Well, he's a little weird. But on the plus side, he's been offered a place at Notre Dame!
Just passing by, and wondered if you'd like to have lunch.
I told him I'd rather go out with a gargoyle
Mom, remember telling me when falling in love, looks aren't "everything"?
You'll never believe who I just ran into out on the balcony.
Call me crazy, but he rings my bell.
Quasimodo? Yeah, that name rings a bell.
I have a hunch he'll be back.
The view is like something out of a Disney movie.
Hi, I'd like to check on the status of my BB gun order.
Actually, my name IS Esmeralda. How did you guess?
He seems to be staring at my foliage, not my cleavage.
I think the neighbor's a little bent out of shape.
Well, Mom, he’s right next door—outdoorsy, daring…kinda short.
Gotta go. My parkour instructor is here.
I'm so sick of Rent Control.
Do you sometimes get a weird hunch?
I think Cirque du Soleil just arrived in town.
I just wish someone interesting would show up in my life.
He says he owns the air rights.
I didn't think to ask what 'unique city views' meant.
The new neighbor is that gargoyle-next-door type.
I guess the Craigslist ad did say 'sunny apartment located On Broadway'
He's a ringer for my first husband.
Yeah, the plant watcher just got here before we leave.
Phase Three will have a view of Moby Dick
Yep, he's watching me like a hawk.
oh hell, the guy sitting on the church spire is blocking the sun from my plant
No, but he wants me to throw him a thing of toilet paper…
Oh, not much. The guy from Match.com is still pestering me.
OMG, look out your window, Sara. It's Weinstein again. Watch this, I'm gonna toss him some panties.
I'll take Notre Dame and 3 for 100.
I don't care if he DID make confession at St Patrick's, Mr. Weinstein STILL makes me uncomfortable!
Oh gosh, is it Humpday already?
I just thought of someone who can look after the plants.
Oh, not much, just watching Igor.
I'll say this for him, he's on the ball.
Yeah, he's back again. I blame Victor Hugo.
I gotta let you go, Jimmy ate too many brownies again.
No, not gargle, I said gargoyle.
I have a hunch he’s stalking me.
Just a hunch, but I think Notre Dame football is going to be back this year.
Listen, I'll let you go. I invited that nice hunchback from across the street over for coffee and sanctuary.
When I asked him if he remembers how he got up there he said "nothing rings a bell".
I'm trying to talk him down, Esmeralda.
Quasi-attractive? Yeah, I guess he is.
Honey, we're out of toilet paper!
He says he's the "hunchback of note the dame."
I know these empty churches are sitting on prime real estate; I just don't want to lose my view.
The good news is that the pidgins don't roost on the balcony anymore.
So our new neighbor is from Paris. Very cosmopolitan.
Oh, and you know how you said when it came to choosing a school, I would just know? I've decided to go to Notre Dame.
I don't care if he claims "sanctuary," I want him arrested for peeping
Realtor might have omitted some details about this view. I have a hunch.
Hang on for a sec so I can scream at my stalker.
Yes, Mom, I'm starting to get out and meet my neighbors.
Yes, it is a bit unusual, but he does keep the pigeons away from our balcony.
No, he doesn't ring it. He just sits there and yells at people at the top of every hour.
I have a quasi-good view.
Do you happen to know what the Notre Dame score is?
Call you back. The bell-tower guy is here
I don't know...he seems nice, but his hump was on the other side last week.
The unit gets plenty of light and Gothic inspiration
I'd like to report a peeping gargoyle.
I love these new hologram classics.
But Mom, he says he can get me into Notre Dame.
These French people are so weird.
I have a hunch my neighbor is at the top of his class at Notre Dame.
Yes, I would like to report a micro-aggression on my balcony.
Whenever he gives me that smoldering hot look of his I can't help myself - I want to wet my plants.
Yeah, I tried swiping left...
Something about this guy rings a bell.
I really enjoy living in Paris. And I've met someone.
911--please disregard my call. He says he can fly.
Looks aren’t everything Mother. At least he’s got a steady job and no other girls. How do I know? He rings me every hour.
Yeah, Paris is lovely. But my new neighborhood has a bit more 'local flavor' than I expected.
Yes, our son finally got in Notre Dame.
They call it the Weinstein treatment.
Mais, non. He doesn't ring my bell.
Oh, I know he's a hunchback Darlene, but if you could only see him. He's at the pinnacle of his career.
I really do love him, but Ted's cosplay obsession is starting to become a bit of a problem.
I know, right? All of a sudden we're seeing Weinstein EVERYWHERE!
The church next door has gone condo, with quasi-detached units.
David Blaine looks a lot different up close.
There’s something about him that rings a bell.
Mr. Moto says hello
Sorry, some relatives arrived. Gotta go, bye.
Yes, I'm sure he's a hunchback, and no, it's not Notre Dame.
...he's asking if he can borrow some sugar...
Can I call you back? Notre Tom is eavesdropping again.
No, not a gargoyle, more like a Gary.
Yeah, well he's 'quasi' freaking me out.
I want to get closer, but he keeps telling me he's not ready to make the leap.
Yes, I know I voted for it but I didn't think that this is what they meant by making this a sanctuary city.
It's really more than just a feeling I'm being watched.
I had a hunch you'd call.
Can I get back to you babe? I've got Quasimodo on hold.
Front Desk? I hate to be a pest, but the new No Solicitors sign does NOT work.
It's not the gargle that freaks me out.
Well the doctor recommended a squatty potty, but you know how Phil always goes to extremes.
Oh it’s fine; he’s just the house-sitter.
Honestly, you would think that ringing that bell got him enough attention.
I got a new ringtone
I like the view, but privacy is an issue.
Gotta go, mom—someone’s ringing the bell.
No, Quasi, for the last time I am not interested in a private tour with you.
Could you at least get off the phone and reject me flat out?
They call me The Pervert of Notre-Dame.
It's our little platonic Pavlovian thing. He rings the bell, I water the plant.
Mr Weinstein followed me home again !
No, it's not my ringtone.
Yes, Daddy, I promise I'll omit my address from my next on-line dating profile.
I thought I swiped left.
No, I don't see a wedding ring.
No, it's my fault. I told the realtor we wanted quasi-modern.
He doesn't just look like him - he's a dead ringer.
Let me call you back. My bell ringer is trying to get in touch with me.
He wanted more space, so I gave it to him.
Well, he's French, a renowned musician and has his own place on the Île de la Cité.
Hold on a sec. Igor wants to talk to you.
Can you please not ring that bell while I'm on the phone?
I watered the plants and let out the cats, but Quasimodo won't come back in.
No, officer, I'm not wondering if I might have a stalker, I just told you I have a hunch.
So, I met this guy who really rings my bells!
It is nice having my husband work so close to home but I still worry about the commute.
He's not Quasimodo but his face rings a bell.
My airbnb has a quasi-view.
He didn't get your text Esmerelda, but I'll make sure he knows you like him.
He's using the church steeple as his quasi-commodo again.
Hold on, Tinder just sent me a new match.
Nah nothing new here same old same old
I'd like to report a missing person from Victor Hugo.
It's been 5 days since I said "Happy hump day!" and he's still mad at me.
Quasimodern: The Hunchback of Rockefeller Center
Can't a girl find a normal hunchback in this city?
Trust me, yoga works wonders!
Well, I used to be able to see the Eiffel Tower.
Hang on, he wants me to get him an Uber.
No, he hasn't moved in yet.
'Yeah he misinterpreted my 'just hanging out' text. And I keep telling him: this WHOLE CITY is a Sanctuary.'
He is creepy...but he's not Harvey Weinstein creepy.
It's a trial separation.
If I keep calmly ignoring him, he will eventually go away like every other hunchback that has been obsessed with me.
I've got to go. You-know-who still thinks I'm Esmeralda.
Really, lieutenant? I should play along that I'm Esmeralda and persuade him to climb down...
Not exactly a peeping Tom, more like a lurking Lon.
Can I get back to you? I have somebody on hold.
Ok, Ok. But don't knock over the plant.
It's Patrick. He's taken out life insurance.
I'm actually watching the last flowering of architecture as an artistic form.
Hey Dad, let me call you back. I need to tip the bellman.
I remember the church, the steeple, and all the little people. Nothing about a peeping tom!
It's more of a quasi-shared yard.
Please hurry! He's acting quasi-suicidal.
Which reminds me, I need to make an appointment with my chiropractor.
Yea, yea, online dates never look like the photo...Gotta run he's here!
The things men do to be noticed.
Creeps are getting far too brave these days.
I've seen him around, and his name rings a bell.
I want to report a Quasimodo.
Not much, you?
Hello police? It's Esmeralda in 936, he's at it again.
Quasimoticon.
Why do I think he’s too short for me? Just a hunch.
"I have a hunch he's back".
It’s the kind of view that looks back at you.
Are you there St. Simeon? It's me, Margaret.
He says Ham and Swiss on rye — hold the mustard.
Hold on....someone is ringing the bell
Looks like Cirque du Soleil is back in town, do you want to go?
No, Mom, I’m not going to ask him if his name is Quasimodo.
It's either a weathervane or I've been drugged and transported to Paris.
On the bright side there are no pigeons...
Put me down for Notredame to win... let's just say I have a hunch .... back to watering... bye.
Our new place has a hideous view.
The realtor said this was a neighborhood in transition.
It's a hunch give me notre dame by 3 points
Well he's not exactly cute, but he's quasi-cute.
...yes, unfortunately you heard me right.
Hello, Police? Harvey Weinstein is outside my apartment.
He's athletic good personality and French.
Hello, Terminix? This is Mrs. Hugo. I'd like to report a mouse.
I'm not sure officer, but somehow he rings a bell.
It would not be a small step for this man but it would be a large step back for mankind.
It looks like my date is here from that new app, Humpr.
It's my sanctuary.
Esmeralda, did you give that Hunchback our address?
I have a hunch my new neighbor may be a problem.
Hold on! I have a hunch I’ll have to call you back!
Esmeralda, you have a visitor.
There's no question that we're a sanctuary city!
Can you hold? Something's ringing.
He's going for the Guinness Church Perch record.
Airbnb didn't mention anything about the view.
On second thought that "bell chime" ring tone was not such a great idea.
I've got a hunch my ex is stalking me.
Quasimodo? Ya, he's here. Why?
Well, I'm on the fence. He does get points for remembering my favorite movie. But he also just dropped the boombox...
He says he's an undocumented Frenchman seeking sanctuary.
It's an airy apartment close to the museums and a farmers' market, also - Victor Hugo lived here.
Yeah, well, its just Quasi-weird ...
A human gargoyle, how precious!
I keep telling him he has the wrong Esmeralda!
It's a long story.
No, I don't know him, but he does vaguely remind me of somebody.
I think it's one of those hideous Disney creatures I've been conditioned to love.
My view is in Seine.
Do I have your attention?
I found Harvey Weinstein.
I'll tell you more later Mom, but he rings my bells if you catch my drift.
I had a hunch he would be back!
The neighbor said he'd watch the pied-à-terre while I'm traveling.
Gotta run. I have a hunch he's back.
Hold on....someone is ringing the bell
Oh, Bill? He's just gargoyling.
Can you spare some toilet paper?
The Airbnber of Notre Dame.
Bring a straightjacket. Oh, and a very tall ladder.
Well, I have a "QUASI-crisis" in front of my veranda at present...let me call you back!
I think he's taking it well.
Oh it's fine, but the neighborhood isn't fully gentrified yet
Well, it has a quasi view of the park.
Do you think it's weird he knows when Keith is away?
I should’ve known there was a reason this apartment was so cheap.
No, Norte Dame is two blocks North of here
He was gone for a few days. But I had a HUNCH he'd be BACK.
Maybe my standards are too high.
'Is the president visiting our city today?'
I have to call you back; my date’s here.
Tried ringing you, thought I'd try voice mail.
He's back and he says he wants to save me from the angry crowds below. He's obviously not a native New Yorker.
I'll have to call you back- Harvey Weinstein's here.
Yes, I said "Peeping Tom." "How do I know he's high?"
He's about 5'6", 180 pounds, and just a hunch, but I think he might be French.
I thought he looked quasi-familiar, but he's not ringing a bell.
No,I just can't ignore him.
He's back, mother. Says he wants a bridge now instead of a wall.
My husband's plans this weekend? Up in the air.
So it looks like they finally sold that penthouse with the 360º views.
It’s just so hard to tell if a guy likes you these days.
It's a terrific apartment, but the view could be better.
I don't think I should have called my plant Esmeraldo.
The pictures on Airbnb made it seem bigger.
I'm fine, what about yourself?
I hear bells whenever I see him
He says I am overwatering
Gentrification cannot finish up too soon.
Indications that the fine line between infatuation and all out stalking has been crossed.
Well, you're on the ball.
I made eye contact with some guy on the subway and he took it as an invitation.
I have a hunch that he's lonely.
Yeah... it's him again. I had a hunch he'd be back.
I have a hunch he's ready to take the leap.
Quasi-modern Architecture.
These gargoyles are really becoming realistic.
Yeah, I know. It's hump day.
My neighbor has been reading super hero comics again.
I have a rather confusing relationship with the church
Yeah, every morning and he never speaks. He is quasi cute, though...
I think that guy I was worried about is coming over
Yeah, Ethel, he's still there. I still don't know who he is, but something about him rings a bell!
Can I call you back? The neighbor is anxious to chat about the sanctuary city resolution.
Ma, remember that guy we saw at the theatre?
Oh, Jim, gargoyles are so passe.
Hunchback of the Upper West Side
Siri, how do you say in French: Excuse me, but it's almost noon. Isn't there something else you need to be doing right about now?
This is your neighbor, reiterating my stance that the "ring bell for service" sign is a bad idea.
No, not really, but his face sure rings a bell.
He said He wants His air rights back.
If he thinks I’m giving him sanctuary, he can forget it.
He just seems like a creeper. Call it a hunch.
My hunch about my date was right.
Just stay on the line so it doesn't seem awkward.
I'd say he's only quasi-creepy.
Mom, it's Esmeralda. You'll never guess who just stopped by.
It's that gargoyle again. He's off his meds and out of his tower.
He says he's not committing suicide, he's ascending to heaven.
What is he like... well, he loves church, is well-rounded and will ring your bell
Oh, great. Harvey Weinstein is back.
Creepymodo, more like.
I don't know, I just have this creepy feeling like I'm being watched.
He wants to know if it's considered a pre-existing condition.
Yes, Quasimodo is abiding by the 10 foot restraining order.
Yeah, Denise? I found your husband. Where? Just think lost cat stuck in a tree, but instead of tree, think steeple.
He told me his name but it doesn't ring a bell.
We complete each other. He needs someone to admire from afar, and I need a really loud alarm clock.
He says he wants to ring my bell for a change.
Hold on Essie, Qua wants to say hello.
The new apartment is great, such a sanctuary from the bustle of city life.
Mom, I'm fine. I have someone I am quasi seeing.
You should be careful—that's a succulent!
"911, yes I would like to report a squatter".
One large pizza going to the top of Notre Dame please.
Just a hunch, but I think he likes me.
Yes, I would like to report a Peeping Tom, 10th floor, opposite the Sanctuary. Yes, the 10th floor.
My Tinder date from last night is quite determined to see me again!
You know the type, creepy in a cute sort of way.
You’ll never believe how real this gargoyle looks! I swear, its eyes follow me around whenever I move.
The Eagle has landed.
He can't tell if he is interested in me or just wants to hang out.
He keeps asking if my name is Esmeralda. . . .
I don't know...I just have this queasy feeling he likes me.
For now, we have a short distance relationship
I had a hunch he'd be back.
The balcony's great but the churchy types across the street weird me out.
No, he's not the halfback.
Can you take my pic?
Yes, but is it art?
You shouldn't over-water that
Does the guy I met on Tinder ring a bell...?
Wait, this guy from church is REALLY trying to get my attention.
I'm the new weathercock.
I'm trying to ignore him.
Can you come over later? I'm on the phone.
I like having a balcony, but the place next door has rooftop deck.
No, I can't just block him--he's an actual troll.
South Bend has fullbacks, tailbacks, running backs. Why not a hunchback?
Why? The rent's too high, the sink leaks and my neighbor creeps me out.
No, my new phone is a Moto, but my new neighbor's named...oh never mind.
He's a lot more attractive in his profile pic, where he's crouching on top of Mt. Everest.
Is it just me or are pigeons getting more menacing?
It's Harvey again.
At least he's wearing clothing this time.
This guy is taking Jahova's Witness to new heights.
Remember, this is Boston. He's not even in the top ten of creeps I've dated.
That makes sense. It's a bell tower not a cell tower.
Well there is this one guy...
Can you believe? A peeping hunchback! Everything happens to me!
He looks like 'Quasimodo,' but claims he's a Hollywood mogul.
Excuse me ma'am - may I ask where you found that ringtone?
He told me he'd be right over.. that he's only a hop, skip and a jump away.
He looks totally unstable, you know, mentally. But physically his balance is amazing.
My hunch was right. He’s back.
Yes, it can be a bit unnerving, but at least he faces this direction most of the time.
With rent control, you never know who your neighbor's going to be.
" I know, but it's Saturday night and in this town I could do a lot worse".
It's such a nice coincidence that I polish the finial ball at the same time that you water your plants.
Yeah. He's doing, like, the medieval version of planking.
I feel like I'm living in a gothic novel, Mom!
Do you have Gloria Allred's phone number?
I've finally found someone who's really on the ball
Call it a hunch.
Mother, I just finished telling Igor, "You got yourself over there, so just get yourself back."
Hold on-I'll ask. Are you Mr. Laughton?
Hey Quasi, go to the Capital, it needs more bell ringing than the Church!
He really pisses off the pigeons.
I keep telling Karl, if he break his neck with this parcour nonsense it's his business, but he better not knock over another one of my plants.
Hello mom, our neighbor is at it again. He is perched on top the bell tower and calling me Esmeralda.
Remind me - is a peeping hunchback considered good luck or bad luck in France?
I think he must be one of those 'goths'.
I think Harvey Weinstein is leering at me from atop the steeple.
I just found a nice place overlooking Notre-Dame but I am worried about one of their tenants.
Yeah, I'm going to a Gothic novel re-enactment meet-up tonight right here in the neighborhood.
Have to go. Gene's home. This role playing to spice up the marriage is going way too far!
He'd love to say hi Mom but he's busy at work.
Nope - still feels creepy.
He looks like a guy I saw in a movie, but I don't remember which one.
I think he's saying that he's a fullback at Notre Dame.
Yes! He finally made it to Broadway!
So, I finally confronted my neighbor about ringing that bell of his at all hours. Let’s just say it could have gone better.
Well, you know, he's got all this free time since he was kicked out of the Academy.
This guy I'm meeting says he's really into architecture and mostly listens to church bell music.
The old neighbors don't fit in anymore.
I think he's hitting on me.
'Something about him rings a bell'
The weirdest part is that he's only admiring his reflection.
Call it a hunch.
I broke up with him last night, but I have a hunch he'll be back.
Yeah...rings a bell.
I’d like to report another peeping tom
I told him I’m Jewish.
NYC stabilized rent sure is hard to come by.
Harvey's back... can you hold on while I throw something at him?
I dunno, he just keeps staring at my bush.
I don't know. It's not ringing any bells.
These kids on their phones nowadays are so oblivious to their surroundings.
If I describe my neighbor, will you let me know if he rings a bell?
Hello, my neighbor asked me to call you; he's dropped his phone.
No, not 'Tom.' What do you call a peeping hunchback?
Dinner tonight? Quasi available...
White male, mid 40s, and, um, calcium-challenged.
Sean and I broke up but he just won't let go.
I've finally met someone who hates that bell as much as I do.
Yeah, it's like steeple chase except you don't move.
I can't figure it out. I think he is quasi-crazy.
I don't care that it has autonomous driving, I ordered the hatchback, not the hunchback!
The neighborhood has a decidedly Gothic feel.
This sculpture look so real.
Yes, I asked him to replace the bell with wind chimes.
I swear he's a dead ringer for Harvey Weinstein.
The folks across the street just listed their place on PrayerBNB.
Nah, I'm not gonna tell him to leave. I get better reception out here, now.
My neighbor's like totally into parkour.
I found out who has been taking my flowers.
I don't dare make the leap from religion to environmentalism.
So this is Halloween in Paris.
The view? A mix of quasi-modern and Quasimodo.
Quasimodo? I don't know. I may be looking at a dead ringer.
911? Could you send over an officer to remove the bat in the belfry next door?
You can't see it on your map? 'N', 'O', 'T', 'R', 'E'. 'D', 'A', 'M', 'E'.
That name rings a bell.
He keeps his WiFi unprotected. We're good.
I've got a hunch someone's watching me.
Sorry, wrong century.
I dunno, Sally, I just have a hunch about this guy.
Yes, he's back. He probably wants to mansplain Gothic architecture to me again and insist on rescuing me from the evils of gentrification.
I have to go mom, my tinder date's here.
Yes 911, it's Quasimodo with a "Q."
So I told the genie I wish I could meet a man who will be devoted to me and make me feel safe, but I don't care what he looks like.
Well, right now he IS hunched, so I don't know...
I think we've got bigger problems than pigeon shit.
Trust me. I have a hunch about these things.
He is cheaper than a security system.
I promise not to leave the seat up next time.
I admire your accomplishment, but you'd seem less weird, if you'd finish dressing.
I have a hunch someone's watching my back..
Just to let you know, I'll be staying at Esmeralda's condo for a few days.
He said he was trying to get closer to God. I just don't know why he couldnt keep his pants on.
Well, yes, I do live in the "Sanctuary Apartments".
Okay, gotta go. Q's gonna hop by for lunch.
You're going to love your new condo, they said. Breathtaking view of Notre-Dame, they said.
Esmeralda? Yes, he insists you gave him this address!
If it isn't love, Mom, it's at least quasi-love.
On the bright side,he looks like he's got a good head on his shoulder.
Hi, I'd like to call in a drone strike.
Of course I'm stalking you.
No officer, not a "Peeping Tom".... a "Peeping Quasimodo".
I don't see it working out, Ma. He's a real gargoyle.
Hello, Pope Francis!
I don't know why, but every time I water my Pot plant, he's there.
My doorbell man is here.
I've got to go Sharon, the neighbors are on their way over.
I wouldn't really mind it if he weren't chanting "Serf's up!"
Now, Belinda, for the last time: Will you marry me?
I knew I should have never let you talk me into letting that Quasimodo guy from the church next door buy me a drink.
I love my new apartment. It's like my total sanctuary.
Nah, just a garden-variety peeping Tom, with no pants. He can climb, but he can't fly.
I guess the broker was right. The view is over the top.
Hunchback of Not Ur Dame.
I'm telling you, he just pooped out an entire cathedral!
The bells? No problem. But the view can be ugly.
He keeps calling me “Precious.” Whatever!
At last! Real competition for neighbourhood ogre!
and I thought my apartment was small
Quasimodo? No, he says his name is Scooter.
He says he's a lightening rod.
He’d like a medium pie with cornichons, whatever that is...
What’s up? Funny you should ask…
He takes face time very seriously.
Oh my god, he just sits there and stares. It's so annoying.
Yeah, they say he wants to be called "Spire-Man."
Another benefit of living next to Notre Dame: we get to chat with Quasimodo.
I would like to bridge the divide between church and sex
I shouldn’t have given him water.
What part of ‘No!’ don’t you understand?
He acts like it's only quasi-separation of church and mate.
Hello? I'd like to report a humpback wail on top of the cathedral.
He’s the strong silent type.
I'm afraid it would be a leap of faith.
It's a wonder our ancestors survived at all, really.
Stop. That's body shaming.
A full-blown stalker? No, he's more of a quasi-stalker.
He keeps yelling, "Sanctuary City!"
When's Esmeralda going to be home from school?
The good thing is that he keeps a watch on the apartment while I'm gone.
You rang?
Oh the neighborhood's nice enough I guess. I just wish it would gentrify a little faster.
Honestly, I have no idea where the Condo Board got their information."
He fertilizes them. I water them.
Yes Padre, but there are also downsides to living so close to Church.
Esmeralda tries the new Blackberry digital assistant, Quasimodo.
The view isn't quite what I expected
I must go, Tony's been watching Planet of the Apes again
You won’t believe this...
Oh I love the new apartment. Its like being in a Disney movie.
Just a sec love, the neighbor has something to tell me.
He wants to lease the vacant apartment below us because his current studio is a walk up.
He says he only wants sanctuary but...
But I told him I'm reading Les Miserables.
Carol, he's a creep. I can't even find him on facebook
No Tree Pose today, Quasimodo?
I've got to change my eharmony profile.
Sure, I can talk. It's a quasi-private balcony.
Totally random, but do you have the name of a good chiropractor?
Actually, he's the furthest thing from spineless.
I don't know. It's just a hunch.
Mom, he's a stylish dresser, he's athletic and he can't keep his eyes off me, I'm gonna say yes.
He looks like your classical stalker.
There's no need to worry, he's on the ball.
Didn’t know St Patty’s had one too
At first I thought it was a gargoyle, but it's beginning to creep me out.
This is Esmeralda in 2401. Quasimodo is back!
It has a great southern exposure with a Quasi-view of the church.
The neighbors are out messing with their satellite dish again.
Well, you know, mothers are often fondest of the child which has caused them the greatest pain. HI, SWEETIE!
Hello, Moto.
I don't know his name but his face rings a bell.
Yeah, he won’t stop staring
Ajax Pest Control? Do you snuff gargoyles?
Yeah, there's kind of a Paris vibe to our downtown.
Plus, I live next to a really famous person who seems to be interested in me.
We overlook Trump Spine Care.
He’s so vain. He probably thinks I’m talking about him.
... but he refuses to move on...
I don't know why he's up there - it looks like he really got his bell rung.
He looks familiar, but he doesn't ring a bell.
I have a hunch he'll be back.
I don't think he realizes we aren't a sanctuary city anymore.
Not sure why but I keep having this strange hunch whenever I come out to water.
I'm gonna have to call you back
He even watches my plants when I am traveling.
Hello, Notre Dame, I think I found your Hunch Back.
Hold on, Sonia. I found a guy who can ring my bell.
He pronounces it "Quay Zai.
I just think 15th Century French Gothic is taking the retro vibe a little too far for a coffee shop
Does the name Quasimoto ring a bell?
Yes, I'm staring right at him.
I'd like to report a man exposing himself in front of my 20th-floor apartment while balancing on an exercise ball on top of a belfry. But can his charge be reduced for his physical agility?
I'm still not a big fan of hump day.
No mom, I've never seen that movie.
Lisa, I think I found a guy you might like -- he's shy, not too tall, and could 'ring your bell'.
you not believe what is growing next door.
No! She said that? That's crazy...
He is a dead ringer for his brother.
Oh, it's just another Leaping Tom.
I'm starting to rethink the free Catholic Singles membership that came with my new apartment.
Sorry, my ringer was off.
For the umpeenth time, you can't claim squatter's rights on a church!
I'm not sure yet, Karen, we met online.
Well, I thought I swiped left.
Yeah, Ma. Quasi's still having trouble moving on.
Harvey is up to his old tricks again
What ELSE can you do?
Yeah, this time he’s whistling show tunes...
He's only a quasi-boyfriend, but I've a hunch there will be bells in our future.
Even the flashers in this city are overachievers.
Ooh, I know the perfect guy. I've got a hunch for these things.
Got a hunch I've seen him around.
He's so easily distracted!
Someone needs to tell him about Match.com.
Can I call you back? The catholic church is about to get embroiled in another shitstorm.
'That's what I said, a single bound.'
I told him if he stopped ringing that bell, I might have lunch with him.
I fed him once and he keeps coming back.
This Squatty Potty thing is getting out of hand
AirBNB was right, you won't believe the view of Paris from this high rise!
I'm quasi-happy right now
He told me his name. Sounds Japanese but he doesn't look Japanese.
I don't know what to do. I told him that he's too needy. It's over. But he stays there yelling  "sanctuary."
Your restraining order doesn't cover this.
Molten metal? No, just water. Why?
Move to a sanctuary city, they said. You'll feel better about yourself.
You'll never guess who I got to write Sally's letter of recommendation for Notre Dame.
Yes, he's there again ...the one with no pants a very bad posture...it seems like we should do something...I know...but...yes the Wilsons will be here a little before six...
Esmeralda, do you remember that friend of yours, Quasimodo?
The new apartment is cool, but the new landlord is a little overbearing.
This neighborhood is being overrun with squatters.
Call the Realtor. A Trump voter just moved in next door.
Can I call you back? Quasimodo is on top of the bell tower again.
I think my neighbor is stealing my tomatoes.
When will those strawberries be ripe?
He's cute but has really bad posture.
But, where am I going to find a sitter on such short notice?
Living in Paris is NOT what I imagined.
He says he's the Hunchback of Notre-Dame but he looks like just another peeping-tom to me!
Yes, I fertilize his fern and he keeps the bells from chiming during Game of Thrones.
I have nine rooms. My neighbor has only one, but it's a ballroom.
Yes. He's still hunched over there.
It's important to not encourage a hunchback, which would only make it worse.
Ever since they hired the new gargoyle, my begonias are wilting.
About that Peeping Tom...I’ve got a hunch.
As far as who he is, I had a hunch - back when he first showed up.
It must be noon. The Lunchback is here.
YOU jump first." "No, YOU!
Hello Monsignor, Just to let you know, Quasimodo is loose again.
I've got a hunch he's the one.
One of our neighbors is really into Halloween.
Siri: Please connect me to The Vatican Pest Control.
Oh God... its back...
One giant leap for mankind.
To be completely quasi-honest with you, I'm seeing someone who's more on my level.
Hump back, Hunch back, does it really matter, anyway whatever it is it's really annoying perched on the Tower like that !
They told me this apartment had a crappy view, but I didn't think they meant it literally!
I know life is all about balance, but I think this guy is taking it to the extreme.
I like to report a peeping Tom. Well, actually he's quasi-peeping.
His Tinder handle was Victor Hugo. I should've known it wasn't his real name.
You know that stalker? I have a hunch he's back.
Just that French guy.
He says we're a Tinder match. Should I let him come over?
So Officer you're saying if he's church-sanctioned, it's legal?
How do I know there's a peeping-Tom in the area? Just a hunch.
Yes, I love my new place - just outside the French Quarter
I can't stay on the phone; Romeo will be here in a minute.
Yeah, I love the new apartment, but I keep hearing bells.
I don't know his name but his face rings a bell.
Yes, I'd like to place a bet on Notre Dame . . . just following a hunch.
I can't begin to tell you of the"iconic" view, except it is reminiscent of a medieval film. No that doesn't ring a bell.
... and the thing is, I used to be into cosplay myself. But still...
I don't know, Quasi something...bell ringer...yeeessss, Mom, he's single.
Actually, I'm a full Modo.
He actually looks quasi-serious this time.
I would say he was High Church, if that's what you want to know.
Yes, an altar boy who is really on the ball
The Hunchback apparently read 'Romeo and Juliet'
Religion has its place, true, but proselytizing sometimes goes overboard.
'Hi, is there someone I can speak to? I think I found Banksy'.
Between working as a bell-ringer and practicing yoga, he keeps a tights schedule.
Apparently we have tbe same ring tone.
What is this -- Willard Straight Hall in 1997?
Someone here keeps asking for sanctuary, but it's a succulent.
Yeah, he's still there..I'm just watering his wig.
I can't place the name but he does ring a bell.
Quasimodo? No, doesn't ring a bell.
"You remember that Victor Hugo novel you lent me some time ago? Well there's this fellow now, looking at me, saying he's thirsty".
I think I've just found our Primary challenger.
Yes. I said that Quasimodo is at my balcony; peeping.
The Key Master lives one floor down.
Eccentric, I grant you, but he's got a lot on the ball.
He’s taking this “We’ll always have Paris” thing way too far.
It rings for thee.
Feels like someone's watching . . . just a hunch.
I never thought I would miss seeing pigeons.
Hunched back and a large schnozz? Ya, it's definitely him. Thank you, officer.
Would you mind moving a little to the left? I'm trying to watch the bears game
Not true, Betty. Quasi's scaled great heights to get where he is today, he looks out for me, and he's still on the ball. OK.. gotta go.. he'll be ringing the bell any minute.
Okay, faking a phone call, acting normal, no quick movements, no eye contact ....
Is it possible this whole "freedom of religion" thing has gotten a bit out of control?
King Kong was the ape. No, I mean the other one!
Let's see...8 letters...rhymes with 'hardboiled'...I've got it! The word is 'gargoyle'!
This Quasimodo guy is really on the ball!
No, he hasn't sent me a friend request yet
I'm not into French guys, but at least he'd be punctual.
Could you change that ring tone to something other than the bells?
Hello, 911? This church next door has a hunchback in its belfry...No, I said back!...No, not bat, hunchback! Oh, never mind.
Call you back, the head of the condo association wants to talk.
I love Paris in the springtime.
Well, that would explain my tinnitis!
I'll call you back. Quasimoto's on the bell tower again.
No, I don't think I know who he is but his face rings a bell.
Please ask the realtor to come. My views are obstructed by a hump.
Do you need any toilet paper?
It’s one of the Modo brothers-Quasi or Semi, I think.
Could you spare a bit of that water for a thirsty climber?
I have a hunch but it really does not ring a bell.
I don't know whether to be freaked out, puzzled, or impressed.
Not to worry, I found someone who will water my plants.
Did you say the half back of Notre Dame is staring into your apartment?
"Isn't it risky leaving a plant a plant on the edge like that?
No, I don't know if he's married or not.
Can't you see I'm talking here?
Leap before you look
I'd like to report a peeping Quasimodo. Again.
Oh, he's in one of his Quasimodo moods again.
He says he thinks he can make it!
I gotta run, Harvey's back.
The view? Oh, just the usual. You know. mam perching on steeple.
Being attentive isn't really the problem.
I'm a live and let live kind of person but it may be time to tighten the Airbnb regulations.
Lately I've been trying to develop a better antisocial network.
Donald Trump is a jackass.
Yes I do know my stalker's last name, It's Moto, Mr.Moto.
He's quasi-obsessed with kidnapping me, but have you seen the size of this balcony?
He's been squatting for so long he basically lives there now.
I'm having a difficult time appreciating the Gothic architecture of the cathedral.
This is the best yoga pose ever!
Ugh sorry can I call you back? He really wants to do this candid pic. I guess they get him more likes or something. Uh huh hump day. Again. SO cliché.
Hi mom, this is Esmerelda. I just want to let you know that Quasimodo is about to swing over here to save me from ennui and my twitter feed.
Two bed, two bath, and a great view of Quasimodo.
Esmeralda? Harvey Weinstein is here to see you.
Well, I won't sleep easy until that last block goes co-op.
I think the Bell Ringer likes me.
I dropped my cell phone a while back. Can I borrow yours?
Well it isn’t gentrifying quickly enough.
Quasimodo’s really “Out There” today!
On the other hand having such a resourceful stalker is somewhat flattering mother.
You took my Tinder rejection too seriously Harold.
I'd like to report a peeping gargoyle.
The leapfrog of Notre Dame is at it again
Just hang on, I get to you after this telemarketing call
He's more or less quasi-mobile.
911? There's a hunchback threatening to jump from a church bell tower ...
I swiped left but it says he's 11 feet away. Now what?
Father O’Malley? It’s Maureen. Next door? Laughton is in your belfry again, and he keeps calling me Esmeralda.
It's a bit too Quasimodish for my taste.
I don't know, Amanda. Either he's a really intrepid peeper or else a rabid botanist who truly cares about this philodendron.
Well, the realtor called it a Quasi-city view...
Hold on, Gina, I think the elevator stopped working, again.
Honey, Trump's here looking for illegal aliens again.
It would be a lot easier if you just answered the phone.
So I answered this ad for a house sitter...
Yeah, I had a hunch you’d call me back
Yes. You are at the seventeenth floor.
Hold on, Susan, I think Quasimodo works for Postmates now.
How do I know he's into me? Just a hunch.
You could say I have a quasi-boyfriend.
You should have sold the air rights while the market was still hot.
I have no idea why - he said he was "onspired"
Hold on - Quasi wants to say hi..............
He says he only rings my bell.
It's a great location; but the view's not wat I'd expected.
just happened to be in the neighborhood...
Let me give you a little backstory.
Sure the tower is monstrous, but I'm getting great reception.
Actually we live in a Quasi-modern apartment.
Good morning new neighbor!
Don't blame me. You're the one that wanted a rescue ogre.
Honey, your hunchback is here.
I'm telling you, Linda, he's really on the ball.
Call you back, time for church.
Monique, swiping left is not going to solve the problem!
I thought the job posting said "Guard" not "Gargoyle"
No, everything's fine? Turns out he's stalking my plant.
"Mom, I really wish you wouldn't have named me Esmeralda".
He's kind of cute and quite determined, but there's something strange about him...
He says he wants me to watch him shower.
Wrong number. There's no Esmeralda here.
To be honest, getting spied on by drones is the least of my concerns.
Well, when my realtor said the neighborhood had a lot of churches I thought that was a good thing. But now...
Put $2000 on Bluebell in the fourth race. I dunno....I've got a strong hunch.
I'm getting too old for this s---.
Mind if I drop in?
Honey, you never go full modo.
I'm invited to sing in the choir.
I need a drink or two, maybe more.
Yes, my new place has a quasi view of the city.
Your small place is rent controlled, too?
911, I need to report a Quasi problem on a nearby rooftop
I just wish he'd Insta me like a normal person.
Hop in your quasimotocycle and get over here quick.
I gotta go.
I'll have to call you back.
Are your Homeowners Association fees as outrageous as ours?
No, doctor. I never forget to gargoyle.
He said he went to Notre Dame and he has the scars to prove it.
I told you he trolled for Weinstein.
Ring-a-ding-ding, baby!
Yeah Mom, I got a hunch...
Look, Officer, I can't tell if he's a politician or a producer. Could you just come and take him away, please?
Do you mind if I hop over for a coffee?
Please tell Mr. Hugo I believe I have located Quasimodo.
Which ones bite, gargoyles or hunchbacks?
I was a frog when you kissed me; can we try for a pigeon?
Another one who looks nothing like his Tinder pictures...
No, its not for me, it is for my neighbor.
I said. "Let's water the flowers, not the towers!"
Hold on a sec, I need to take a Quasi photo.
yeah i'm going to need to call you back
I am sorry your Holiness but Peeping Quas is back.
Just waiting for the gentrification to be finally done!...
Hello 1-800-Flowers? I'm going to need a larger arrangement.
No, it's not exactly the way I envision Romeo and Juliet
This is such an easy city to meet new people.
Not sure, but I have a hunch.
Hang on, I’ll ask my neighbor where he got his squatty potty....
He really went above and beyond with his Halloween costume this year.
Nah ... the view's allright, it's jut not what they promised and it's not what I'm paying for ...
Hello, is this The New Yorker? I have a great idea for your caption-contest cartoon! NOT PART OF CAPTION: Please. pretend that The New Yorker is italicized. I don't know how to do that here.
Q is in awesome shape. He's warming up for the parkour jam.
Says his name is Bats and he's looking for a low cost Belfry.
Hello, Officer? I'd like to report a Peeping Quasimoto.
The bell-tower guy is getting quasi-creepy.
Are you still looking for your bell ringer ?
Ellen, now do you believe I love you.
Show your profile and I'll take a photo!
Oh, he SAYS he's looking for love but I think he's after my fresh basil, Officer.
Not only that. He jacks my wifi.
My building has changed a bit but I still have rent control
He definitely rings my chimes.
911, that horney Hollywood guy is back!
Hold on, Romeo's mooning over my diffenbachia again.
Paris has lost it's charm, but I have a real bell ringer of a view!
Are you the new pastor?
To be honest, I'm starting to prefer the southern exposure.
And yesterday, he dressed up as the Beast.
Esmeralda? A friend of yours wants to set up lunch.
If you let him out again, I'm calling the Pope!!
No way, I'm not making the first move.
Do you guys know what your friar is doing now?
Can you also pick up a water gun from the store honey. There's something I've been meaning to do.
It's getting quasi-creepy
Not sure, but his face rings a bell.
Sorry to bother you, Father, but he’s peeping at me again.
Got to go now. I'm holding up the bell-ringing.
Sorry, I've got to get off, my stalker is back
About that quasi-cell tower you put in mid town…
Do you think I should let him ring my bell?
What's parkour?
I still think you're overwatering it.
The dinner went fine until my mom mentioned wedding bells.
You get used to be stared at when you're wealthy. It's the pre-existing condition that bothers me.
I think somebody might be staring at me, but it's just a hunch.
Mom, I just discovered why my new rental is called the Esmeralda Suite.
Getting up is the easy part.
I know...you'd think it would fall off any second.
I told him, "I'm not your dame."
Now I kind of miss the gargoyle.
Oh Stanley, he's still out having a ball.
I'm turning my balcony into, like, a quasi-garden.
Hi. Yeah, Dana? Your husband is playing gargoyle again.
I have an unobstructed view all the way to Trump Tower.
...just met our new neighbor, does the name Quasimodo ring a bell?
At the risk of sounding conceited, I have a hunch he likes me.
He wants to take me to see Les Miz. He says he knew the author.
I think he said he was a half back at Notre-Dame.
Yeah, Tiffany. My neighbor is Notre Lame.
Have to call you back. The guy next door needs to use my bathroom.
I'll call you back. Someone's at the spire.
You may come over unless your name is Harvey Weinstein
Never heard of it. I wasn't much of a Disney kid.
When I requested a quasi-modern apartment, I wasn’t expecting this view!
Let me call you back, I need to feed my gargoyle.
Let's meet in the park next time.
I thought you said the view was of Hackensack...
The view isn't bad, but I have a hunch I have loud neighbors.
Sure, give me a ring anytime.
In his photo he looked taller.
Damn luxury apartments. I can't see anything from up here.
Yeah, I love the new apartment. It's quasi-modern.
Do I know you? Your face rings a bell.
Hello Guinness. Can you tell me what is the record for a staring contest?
Stunning view of Notre Dame, and he only faps when the bells ring.
This peeper is really on the ball.
Hold on, my neighbor's looking for his shoes.
Paris officials to stop development around Notre Dame Cathedral on more than a hunch.
It's just my neighbor. He's a character.
Mom, yes, it's an eclectic neighborhood. But, I feel as safe here as I do back home in South Bend.
It's more of a quasi-private balcony.
911? No,No! It's not Harvey Weinstein. I have a hunch it's the Hunchback of Notre-Dame
He keeps asking if Notre Dame made the playoff.
My complaints about being in a sanctuary city have fallen on deaf ears.
I just googled 'Paris' and 'real local experience'.
Hey, gotta go - Quasi is creeping me out again.
I've got a hunch he won't go quietly
He promised not to lose his shirt playing bingo this week.
He borrowed my tights again.
I think he's compensating for something.
He doesn't talk much but he's very attentive.
Well, the flat is tolerable, but the view is quasi-mundane.
I hate to admit this but he kind of rings my bell.
Did you say Notre Dame needs a hunchback or quarterback?
It's so difficult to meet people in this city.
Just some guy with shoulder pads taking a knee or something.
I think he's employed by Harvey Weinstein, so I'm not falling for it.
I just got a new follower on Instagram.
Hello, Moto.
I'm sure it's the synagogue. What does his back have to do with it?
My downstairs neighbor insists I look at him when he speaks.
Can you hear me now?
He likes to watch the wind send my potted plants crashing 40 stories down to the sidewalk.
I've got to go my yoga teacher is here.
I can't afford a drone.
That’s not what I meant when I asked you to give me a ring.
I'm asking him in, it's just a hunch.
Hello, police? He's invading my sanctuary again.
And he looks thirsty.
Really regretting that Esmeralda joke
He's taking cosplay to new heights.
Well, Jane, it's not much better, but I'm getting a quasi-signal from the tower now.
He's got, like, a back thing going.
What's the world record for the long jump?
Honey, Trump is president up there, too.
I'm beginning to understand why the rent is so cheap on this place.
I dunno. Some creepy guy doing yoga.
This dating service has got to go.
Yes babe, I'm touching myself.
Hey, I may need to call you back...just a hunch.
I had a hunch back last week as to who the peeper was.....
It was my hunch he'd be back..
I'll have to call you back, my Ubermodo is here.
Hello, is this not-an-animal control?
Quasimodo's ex is rethinking her apartment situation.
Can I come home now?
Hi, is this 'Any & All' Pest Control?
No, mom, my new unit doesn't have any 'typical, big city problems.'
Charles Laughton would like to speak to you!
Don’t you just love city living?
Height? Well , probably not average. He's kinda bald ; white, I think....
Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about gentrification?
And it looks like he might be the one who stole my other plant.
I can't believe this is their idea of "an apartment with a view".
The Johnson kid found the classic novels again.
Miss? Miss? Have you seen my flying butt dress?
He's always asking me for my wifi password.
Hell's bells, you won't believe what ....
No, not that Notre Dame. I had an athletic scholarship.
Mom, should I go out with this guy? He's gone out of his way to look me up.
No, still no name, but his face rings a bell.
I feel like people can see everything I do here.
Acmée Plumbing? The toilet at Notre Dame is clogged again.
O.k. O.k But putting those exciting possibilities to one side I would still prefer you dialled 911.
Now he's giving me that puppy-dog look. Maybe I'll give him another chance.
He hasn't asked me yet, but he's building up to it.
He was all like, “No face as hideous as mine was ever meant for Heaven's light, but suddenly an angel has smiled at me and kissed my cheek,” and I was like "Whatever . . . ."
He's Quasi cute...
Could you water my plant while I'm away?
No, not a jumper, a dumper.
Are you sure the elevator is out of order?
No, I said he's a quasi-modern eavesdropper.
I have a hunch it's the same guy, and he's back for another drink of water.
The new gargoyle they've installed on the church steeple next door is freaking me out.
...but I always heard Charles Laughton was gay.
No officer, I'm safe. But I think you should send someone in case Mr. Weinstein decides to jump.
Hold on. My creepy, rent-controlled neighbor is staring at me again.
You are not going to believe this cute guy sitting right outside my deck!
I've never heard of his website , either, but the brick-and-mortar version rings a bell
I have a hunch that he likes me.
The dating service matched us by height. I don't think that worked.
It will take a leap of faith.
"Hello Padre, I think your bell ringer is on the ball.
Hold on. I'm watching a tryout for "Vertigo,"
Please hold for Harvey.
He and the bell are a bit annoying but it was way below market.
Please don't knock my plant off when you come in for dinner.
One leap could do it.
Yeah, he keeps shouting something at me that sounds like May Day but it's October.
I always know what time it is.
Yup, here's still there . . . He just keeps yelling "Quasi-YOLO!"
King Kong is busy. You want to leave a message for him?
How is he the victim?!
Frogman steadied himself and coiled his tongue. Soon he would have a cell phone of his own.
Most of those Parkour guys who come by are young and fit. But this one…wow!
church? CHURCH? . . . that seriously unattractive Quasi character would probably come down and start bugging me for a date again!
Sorry, I'm already seeing someone.
I think there may be a full moon tonight.
They didn’t tell me they were building an 18th century cathedral to block my view, when I bought my condo.
Yeah, he’s back. Yep, he’s still hunched.
I'm not kidding. It tolls for me.
I don’t mind you staring at me, as long as you stop with that damn bell.
911 Help! This guy thinks he is a cat. I cannot convince him that he is a bird.
I'd like to report a peeping Quasimodo.
She says “Go for it. It’s a leap of faith.”
Quasimodo says I should change my ringtone.
The bellman is staring at me again!
Yeah Mom, I'm sure it's him, John just never understood "Acceptance"!
He's Quasi-creepy is what he is.
No, I think he just got lost looking for the bathroom.
Heads up that our neighbor Quasimodo is quasi mobile.
...Hmmmm, nope, doesn't ring a bell...
Hold on, Gary's mocking evolution again
I really gotta change my ring tone.
I know I live on the 50th floor, Officer MacDoo! He is still a Peeping Tom!
You're dripping on the sauna.
I wish he’d stop trying to ring my bells.
He says he is out of the sanctuary game, but he now teaches advanced yoga.
Agnes, have you seen my bell?
He claims there are bats in his belfry.
I advise you to water only once a week !
The marijuana plant is a bit too potent.
Hey, my upstairs neighbor, please do not water your plant with hot water. It hurts your plant and my hair!
It depends upon your definition of "ledge".
Esmerelda! I had a hunch you’d call
Don't 'Esmeralda' me! The dude is creepy!
You win! Your mobile connection IS better!
''Actually Officer this one seems extremely acrobatic therefore I would describe him as a Full Moto''
no worries, he is on the ball
Let me call you back. A guy outside wants to play Hunchback of Notre Dame.
No, definitely not Spider-Man.
I could use a drink of water
Qui, il est toujours la'...
What do you mean by the food delivery guys not taking the elevator or the stairs?
Just look for the building next to the huge Notre Dame fan.
Hold on, my hunchback is back.
Harvey Weinstein's still doing it!
Esmeralda, stay the hell downstairs until I call you back. Yolo.
I have a hunch your name is Esmerelda, right?
Honey, I came up here because your mobile is busy.
I honestly don't care what he does, so long as he stops ringing that damn bell.
So, at first, like when they said I'd be in the Heritage District, I was like "cool."
Morning, Kel! Coffee later in the bell tower!
I might be clueless, Monica, but my boyfriend has a hunch.
He says he needs to take a leap of faith.
Some perv pastor is doing yoga on the church steeple.
Excuse me. Talking on the phone and watering that precariously placed plant is quite dangerous.
I don't know. Maybe a little yoga would help.
I don’t care if he is in the movie business, stalking is not acceptable.
Jump! You can make it.
Yeah, he's a dead ringer for the guy I met in France.
Hold on. I'll ask. One hump or two?
Is 'Bats in the Belfry' a communicable disease?
Oh nothing, I'm just hanging with Quas and his flying buttresses.
I have a hunch the neighbor is back from Notre Dame.
Are you asking me out?
I shouldn't have been so hasty in changing my Facebook status to "single."
Have to go, the cocktail bell is about to ring.
And I told them, I would never sell out.
Come here often?
It might be more difficult than you think, the French sent a ringer.
The contemporary art movement feels stagnant.
Yeah, he's still out there trying to impress me.
The French-Gothic architecture is amazing. The French-Gothic hunchback is a bit creepy.
That reminds me. I need to see my chiropractor.
Your face is familiar but your name doesn't ring a bell.
No, the guy I met at church didn't work out.
He keeps shouting, “Outside the Church there is no salvation.” I tell him, “Don’t be so ironic.”
That's right officer, Quasi with a "Q". We met after the Michigan State game.
I have to go to the bathroom.
voulez vous telephoner avec moi ce soir
No Mom, I didn't say he's a quasi-hobo!
Ya, with my good looks and access to water, I get why he's here. I looked him up on Wikipedia.
No, I don’t floss. I gargoyle.
OK, who watered the gargoyles after midnight?
If he jumps again I'll get a selfie with him and text it to you.......
Remember I was telling you how boring the architecture is around here?
...and here we see the hunchback in his natural habitat...
Well, I've sworn of Tinder forever.
I have to change my ringtone.
Sorry, that doesn't ring a bell.
I'll just put you on speaker, OK?
Yes, that's right, a squatter, at Saint Mark's.
...by the way, could you check on Google how far hunchbacks can jump?
He says his name is Quasimodo.
He's a little creepy, but he keeps to himself and is pretty quiet...until he rings that damn bell!
I don't know but he said he's trying to "cherchez la femme".
I'm telling you, it's Steve Bannon
'Quasimodo'? Sorry, that name doesn't ring a bell.
The hunchback is staring right at me. Yes, I'll hold...
I think Quasimodo wants to ask me out.
It's not so bad once you get used the quasi-creepy neighbor
I've gotta hunch you just got back from vacation."
Shows to go ya,' there's more than one way to get high.
This is the only way I get to see you.
So he said he'll prove we DO see eye to eye
Hey Bob, it's Ezzie. Quick question: Disney's been keeping up with their copyrights, right?
I'll always have Paris
I was wondering when you would water it.
He keeps asking if he can ring my fern.
Hot yoga is so yesterday.
Don't worry, I have a hunch he'll be back.
Harry was in an ideal state to make a leap of faith.
I have a hunch she'll finally notice me now.
Actually, it's not me he's obsessed with, it's my water.
He's exposing his bat in the belfry.
It's Harry again, he thinks I can't see him.
The guy with no pants is back. What is this, Hollywood?
Hold on Sharon, 'George, your chicken fingers are getting cold!'
He's cute, but I never date Notre Dame football players.
Neuf-un-un, s'il vous plait, madame!
My name? Why, Esmeralda. Why do you ask?
we have a new cell tower. I can hear you now.
May be this isn't the best place for meditation.
This is what I get for moving into an historic overlay district.
Does 'sanctuary' mean anything in particular to you?
I've just about broken him of his inability to take his keys with him when he leaves.
Some ugly guy without pants is promising me an Oscar worthy role if I let him in.
Yes, I’m sure he’s real. No, I’m only quasi drunk!
Oh, you know, same as always. Watering the plants, being ogled by Quasimodo.
He doesn't like hunchback. He prefers spineless.
Gotta go now: my French Lit. prof is dropping over.
No, I'm not kidding, it's the Notre-Dame Cathedral all right.
So I went on a date with a guy named Quasimodo… I know right. Anyway he’s not much to look at but I felt such a connection to him. We share so many interests it’s like he sees me in ways no one else does.
Hunchback? What hunchback?
He's wearing the shirt I gave him--that's a promising sign, don't you think?
Gotta go Mom, my pesky neighbor is again inviting me over to help ring the bells.
He says he's only quasi-stalking.
Make sure the plant is properly balanced
No, I don't think it's an Audio-Animatronic gargoyle.
No, he says he lives in the bell tower and just likes seeing how I water the plants.
I know! What does he think this is, 1482?
"Well...our realtor did promise us the Condo has a Quasi-view.....!
My neighbor is quasi-creepy.
I'm being stalked by this deformed parkour maniac and you ask about his manners?! As if!
I water every day at exactly four of your bells. Thank you Quasi!
No, I can stand the bells just his face is repulsive.
I had a hunch you'd be here.
Ok, gotta go. I promised my neighbor I’d take him tunic shopping.
I'm sorry. He's out right now.
What are you talking about?! Don't be silly, Emma, no one would be able to steal my pot plant.
Yes, the name of your chiropractor. I'm asking for a friend.
I guess I'll go out with him. At least I'll find out how he got up there.
I'm staying next to the Moto apartment complex.
Rent control isn't all that it's cracked up to be.
Gotta run, Quasi’s begging for Miralax again.
Hello management, I'd like to report a peeping hunchback.
Pop over, there’s a new gargoyle exhibit today.
Legalized marijuana brings out the romantic in me.
Hello, is this the Quasimodo Landscaping Service? Would you please tell your attendant who cautioned me about over watering my philodendron that the monsignor has given me this to do as a novena.
What do you think? Should I call the cops or the human society?
I have a hunch; I'm going to have to call you back.
Peeping Tom on steroids.
He calls it an audition but he's out of his belfry.
He says his name is Queasy Mojo and only I can make him ring the blues. You think I should invite him in?
Next door there's a one-story Gothic.
He may be stalking me but it's just a hunch....
Forget social media, old-school stalkers are definitely riskier.
Hey Honey, that guy is taking a shit again.
I have a bad hunch about him.
OK, Phantom, it's time to come in for dinner.
What used to be the limit for voyeurs, isn't the limit anymore.
I have a hunch, you're back.
I don't have a hunch who he is!
The view is quite legendary.
That weirdo, Quasi Modem, is back.
I am desperate, my gardener quit---please say you will water my flowers!
Actually, you picked a great time to call.
It's kinda growing on me.
He's growing on me.
I met someone, he really knows how to ring my bell.
I just can't get past that he's French.
Marge, remember you were wondering why your husband was taking areobatic lessons.
This is not what I meant when I told you to meet me outside Quasimodo.
Do you happen to remember if Ivan did broad jump in high school?
All I wanted was a room with a view.
So that's why they call them Cardinals.
I call him Dirty Old Spider Man.
Simon says: Water me!
Of course he's a monster, but he's MY monster.
I'm really sorry, Ted, but I'm seeing someone right now.
Yeah, it's an old pot but the flowers are beautiful.
Could I trouble you for a cup of sugar?
This is the last time that I accept a date on hump day.
Not everything that looks like a gargoyle is a gargoyle... not even my ex
He knelt down and gave me a ring.
Yes, I agree. Donald will do anything for attention.
Different guy. This one says he's the celebrated jumping frog of Calaveras County.
Harvey Weinstein is leering at me again. What are you up to?
He doesn't even look like a real Modo. More like a quasi-Modo.
My Tinder date's just arrived - let's see if he can ring my bell.
You'll love the view, it has a certain 'old world' charm.
The new Bell Guy is very attentive.
...he's got a career and doesn't live with 4 roommates
I'm telling you, Harvey does not take no for an answer.
Interestingly, the only thing we don't see eye to eye on is the need for him to stand up straight.
Can you wake everyone tomorrow?
It's kind of creepy, every time I water my plants he keeps saying "Wah-ter!" "Wah-ter!" "Wah-TER!"
Gotta run, neighbor guy about to pop over. Says he knows how to ring my bell. Whatever that means !
It's that bellringer again. Let me call you back.
The view? Well, I would say it is a quasi one.
Hold on. Someone's ringing in.
You must have paid alot extra for that ring tone.
I think he followed me back from Paris.
Yes, this is Esmeralda.
'' I know it, I told him yesterday its an easy jump it's only an inch and a quarter away ..."
Careful! The plant's too near the edge.
Securely balanced,yes,but may be a bit dehydrated.
My divinity degree allows me to reach the top.
Is it called Notre Dame?
No, we finally got a divorce, we could never agree on what style of architecture we wanted to live in.
My ringtone is better than yours.
Norte Dame is about to make an offer, but it's just a hunch.
What's the politically correct term for Hunchback?
I dunno.. I think he needs to borrow my phone..
The church updated his job description. Now he's a bell ringer and a gargoyle. It saves money!
You think my peeping Tom is Quasi-who?
It seems I need to change my ring tone to something less, shall we say, 'striking'.
These European toilets really need some modernization!
I'm just saying maybe it's time to update eminent domain laws.
This is Esmeralda.
You have to see this: When I went on one of those internet dating sites to meet someone who's on the ball, this isn't exactly what I expected.
A very unusual pigeon, I think.
Wait...The little fake Batman guy is back again.
The images are compelling, but ultimately the composition fails; they both ended up in the grill of Ford F150.
I told him, I said, ‘You’re at the pinnacle...’ he just looked at me.
He’s a dead ringer for Quasimodo.
...just a hunch
I think my neighbor is an alumni of Notre Dame.
Quasimodo. No, it doesn't ring a bell.
No I will not marry you!!!
I can see he has no pants. How much spring does he have in his legs?
If I use the words hunchback and stalker together in a description will it be un-pc?
He's upset they took away his air rights.
We'll always have Paris, Jerome.
We were quasi seeing each other, but it's gotten a little creepy.
Hold on, Its the guy from Yoga again.
Just a hunch, back-assed way to moon me?
Oh, him? I had a hunch he'd be back.
Oh, it's that little man from next door again. He likes to hear me sing. Gotta go now. Bye.
Mom, it is a steeple peeper, not a gargoyle.
It's more than a hunch that he's back.
Hey, lady, that's a partial-sun plant.
Quasimodo is stalking me again.
Bellman impresses me with his ding dong.
Hello, is this the French language translation line??
Can't you see I'm on the phone? Come back in an hour.
The new neighbor brought over holy water, so I'm hoping that'll perk it back up.
Failing to gain her attention, Bill assumed the pigeon position.
911 operator? Help! Some pot head pervert from the cathedral named Quasi wants jump on my balcony, smoke some reefer, and "show me his moto"!
He brings out the gypsy in me.
Actually he is more of a peeing Tom.
I've got a hunch he's harmless.
Yea and he forgot his key again,this time I’m not letting him in!
The high priest next door takes things too literally.
Yeah, you won't believe how tough the church has gotten with its sanctuary policies.
Harry, you told me the gentrification would be done last week!!
I keep telling him no, I won't take my clothes off and give you a massage!
No, he definitely knows we're not together anymore.
Hey, Esmeralda! You need to get over here. Quick!!
Straighten up!
Well Mom... I'm kinda seeing somebody.
588 by David Borchart
Yes, officer, I suppose he is somewhat a master of the obvious but he is also a peeping Tom.
Call it a hunch, but he sees my point of view.
I just missed a rent-control apartment next door.
Call it a leap of faith but I'm expecting a friend to drop in from the church to conduct a short private service.
There's this weird guy on top of the church tower calling me Esmeralda and asking me for sanctuary. Have you ever?
Helen, he's threatening to jump.
Esmeralda, he wants to know if you'll be ho e for dinner...
I told you Jim, we should never have moved next to the Notre Dame Cathedral.
Wait—hold on, can I call you back?
I'll call you back; I have a hunch I am being stalked.
"Wherefore art thou cellphone and pants, Romeo?
You wanted to be Catholic.
What do you mean, you won't do anything? I thought this was a sanctuary city?
3, 2, 1, ....
ooooooo i've travelled in time and look at that girl "whistles"
I think it's that actor from Birdman.
Then he said, "Is it all right if I call you?" And I said, "Yes, I'd like that." And he said, "OK, I will then." That was, like 10 days ago. What's wrong with men?
When you try to impression your crush, but she calls the cops on you.
I have a hunch my ex wants me back.
I think somebody's been following me. Let's just call it a hunch.
Yes, he brought the bell, too.
Hello... Deacon Frollo, I think you need to have a talk with Quasimodo.
It's just another parkourist.
Betty, I can't tell if he is looking at me or my plant
I believe this is what's known as a "meet-cute."
I feel like my life is kinda a Disney movie
Hey Esmeralda, that guy you've been seeing is here again.
Looks like I'm going to have to spray for pests.
What day is it again? Oh, never mind ... it's Wednesday ...
It's a quasi-obstructed view, but you get used to it.
He honestly doesn't say much, but seems really opinionated about which flower pots I use.
Yep, he's here again, and still asking if I'm Esmeralda.
No, it's the plant. I can always tell if someone is staring at me.
Well, what about MY sanctuary?
Esmeralda!! It's me, Qasimodo... it looks like you've been avoiding my calls.
I'm going to have to ring you back. SORRY. NO OFFENSE.
I want to report a dirty old man
Sorry. I don't know his last name.
No, he’s not that good looking, but I saw on Tinder that he lives right next door. What’s the harm?
Superman? This is Lois. Junior is acting up again.
I think my Esmeralda plant has an admirer.
I met him on a new app called Quasi-Monde. He's coming over right now.
Well, I just got a hunch.
I gather that Harvey Weinstein is doing a remake of The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and that he is starring in it.
I don't think swiping left will work in this case.
He said he has a hunch about me.
I'm waiting for him to spread his wings.
Well, he says he also has a place in Bridgehampton. What do I tell him?
Sorry, it's just that annoying Quasimodo telling me his sad tale.
So far I love it here, the neighborhood is a great mix of new and old.
Betty, I think the anti-depressants are acting up again.
But for her posture and over-watering, he would have asked her out.
Either I have tinnitus or your talking about me, what else could it be ?
Remember that unsuitable suitor? I have a hunch he’s back.
There's nothing quasi about him. He's a real modo.
he's super pissed about gentrification but, like, his argument isn't very nuanced?
Peeping Gargoyle.
Some renters are squatting on prime real estate with beautiful city views and cathedral ceilings.
I've given up dancing and now we spend all our time together.
Aren't there some bells that need ringing?
Fame? He says half the people want to know how he liked the opera, and the other half tell him his face somehow rings a bell.
Notre Dame? I assumed a college guy would have used the stairs.
I think he's harmless and just squatting in an unoccupied building.
If he's going to sit up there all the time they should change the name to Notre Dude.
I'm watering a plant.
A peeping hunchback. I know, right?
Yes.. I'd like to report a peeping hunchback.
To be fair, his profile did say he was into cosplay.
Spin it any way you want, but you still violated our property disclosure contract.
This one IS Claiming to be a Good Catch and NOT Jewish!
Yeah, he's back...No, that's not necessary- he can't keep this pose much longer.
You won't take my calls, so you left me no other choice.
It looks like they've started filming Mission Impossible 7..
Well, I guess I find it quasi-unsettling.
I know I could just give him some water, but wouldn't that be encouraging him?
He’s quasi-stalking me again.
He helps make it a complete Sanctuary City.
not much, nothing new here; how about by you?
I told him, I said look fella I'm not that type of girl.
Police, the stalker I told you about is back again.
Some things never change in Norte Dame.
Gotta go my date just arrived outside!
No I didn't get the part, but it felt like Harvey Weinstein may have taken an interest in me for future roles. Who knows when I'll see him again though.
People are dying to have my view!
My neighbor Quasimodo is going to making a leap of faith.
Hang on, the bell ringer wants to know what time it is.
Be careful not to over water it!
Hi! I just happened to be in neighborhood...
Am I just swapping one institution for another?
I'm good, mom. I'd be better if Quasi would realize it's really over this time.
Joanie, vacay plant-rescue mystery, um, solved.
He must have taken the stairs.
You're so vane, you probably think this call is about you.
Do not ask for whom the bell tolls.
He says he's a celibate.
I had a hunch he would be back!
Sorry, you're really breaking up. Yes, I'm as close as I can get to the bell tower.
You say a big bird just pooped on your head? I don't think so.
Damn-it, when I bought this high rise apartment there was no mention of peeping-Quasimodo being my next Cathedral neighbor.
Charles Laughton! What are you doing here?
Oh look " It's the Hunchback of Notre Dame picking up extra shifts as a peeping tom ! "
The next time you forget your costume, I would just stay home.
I thought I was paying extra for a view of a wildlife conservatory.
Well yeah, of course I agree with the First Amendment, but are these "Daily Exercises of Religious Freedom" really necessary?
Thanks Esmeralda for confirming he is a vegan.
I think he'd like us to get back together.
You make it hard to talk face to face.
But he's not ringing the bell... he's on the roof again.
Flirting? No, just playing a hunch.
He says he's famous.
You may think I'm stalking you but, really. it's just a steeple chase.
OK Esmeralda, I'll put him right on
Not hatchback Bishop, HUNCHback....and he's....what?....no, your car is NOT on the roof, it's that MAN again with the....what?....no, My car is downstairs, it's that MAN....what?....no, it's a Mercedes S Class....
OK, I admit it. I told him he has to watch me water a potted plant if he wants to be in my movie.
If your hair were longer, I could come over.
Yes, officer. I'm being flashed by the halfback of Notre Dame.
Hurry up and take the photo, this will be perfect for my City Living Botany Blog.
You won't believe the irony. Okay, I'm calling you from Motorola's new Quasi-Moto phone, right?...
In the book, "The Hunchback of Notre Dame", does Hugo mention if Quasimodo can jump?
Yes he is annoying , but not as much as those damn bells!
Yes of course I've locked the door!
My name...Okay. Esmeralda. On the 35th floor facing the bell tower. He's sitting on top of it and he's getting ready to jump onto my balcony. He's going to knock over my plant.
Is it ok if I drop in later?
Mom says it's time for us to change places!
Namaste!
He always puts himself on this holier-than-thou pedestal.
You’ll never believe how realistic this gargoyle is! I don’t know how I didn’t notice it when we first moved in.
He's been here for days... claims he will give me a job if I "ring his bell".
that priest is peeping again
Okay! I'm sorry.
Let’s see... He’s outdoorsy. He likes climbing. Interested?
Sorry, St. Patrick's already has a hunchback.
I donno, I think it's going to rain. How about you?
He says he just wants a tomato!
Don't worry; he's not a leaf hopper. He's a BASE jumper.
He has a hunch I'm overwatering
Oh hey and by the way, did you get an invite to Harvey Weinstein's party in the Hamptons this weekend??
call 911
Yeah, I swiped left. Let's just call it a hunch.
No... its you know who about to pull a Harvey Weinstein on top of the bell tower.
Pick up your phone. We can figure this out together.
He says he wants a percentage of your album sales for a sample of his rings.
He preferred to incur her anger rather than to cause her pain.
Sean Spicer just started a new gig with our neighborhood church.
Hold on a second, I have a hunch the neighbor needs something...
hunchback or not, can't you at least give him a bathroom key?
Take the picture
I knew the bell tower view was a bad idea.
This balcony scene is not as romantic.
My new place has kind of an old world view from the deck
Hold on a minute, there's someone on my bell tower.
He says he's in training to be the hunchback of Notre Dame, so I guess I've got a lot to learn about football.
Did you know every cathedral has a bathroom?
...and, what is the bell schedule today?
It's a miracle how this plant is growing. Holy water and same day delivery.
Hey Esmeralda, you talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? Then who the hell else you talkin' to?
Yeah, Quasi'll be here in a minute.
I don't know. Something about the ringtone drives this guy crazy.
But I thought the mascot for Notre Dame was a leprechaun.
It's like taking a knee, but it's okay as long as the flag isn't being disrespected.
Living here is so quasi Paris.
Yeah, he's been up there ever since I sniped him on eBay for this plant.
He's harmless mother and he's a little hunchbacked.
I think he's a composer.
The new neighbor's a real poser.
Move that plant, I'm coming over!!!
Uh huh, he tells me there are no public bathrooms in Manhattan
He says he pays $500 a month.
I agree... in godly world, shit takes you to the top.
I know it's silly, but every time I come out to water the wandering Jew I feel like it's watching me.
In a sudden leap of faith Brother John decided to leave the Monastery and throw himself at the girl next door all at the same time.
It would only go viral if he were cute. Or, a cat.
It'd be one thing if it was parkour, but he just sits and stares...
I have a hunch the answer’s staring me right in the face.
Is it inhumane to not feed my stalker?
Sorry, Esmeralda lives two floors down.
911? That Peeping Quasimodo is back again
that plant is dangerously close to the edge
He says he's a movie producer.
Hey baby, take down my quasi number!
I fed it once and he still comes back every day
It’s not the Jehovah’s that’s got me uneasy it’s the witness.
...I wish he'd stop calling me Esmeralda.
Can't take the frog out of that prince.
Could you move that a little to the left?
Oh, wait. I'll get back to you. I've got a hunch
I'm quasi concerned about him as a neighbor....
not sure I know him, but he rings a bell :)
It's definitely an up-and-coming neighborhood.
Preservation of historic landmarks? whatever. Still gives me the creeps. At least he should put on some pants.
The FAA needs to revisit their drone policy.
What's the city's stand on sanctuary for a 'quasi' something?
It's a fern, but he keeps shouting, 'Topiary! Topiary!'
There's a guy out here who insists that he writes all your material.
I swiped up by mistake.
It appears the rooftop confessionalis back up for rent
Yes, I'm feeding it right now.
I've got to put you on hold darling, some just came up!
Jeez Louise, what's a girl to do.
Hold on, Trump has a few words.
That's right; he's a dead ringer for my ex, but he'll be perfect for caring for my plants when I'm on vacation next week.
My neighbor's really into the sanctuary city thing.
Can I borrow some toilet paper?
Shelly, don't be so insinsitive. He's spinally challenged, and it's pronounced 'Domm.'
Says his name is St. Tom.
You dated him when? Hmm... He’s not ringing any bells.
Hey, can I have some of that water, ma'am?
It's great, except for the obstructed view.
I'm dating Rudy.
Then again, it's not like he's in a bathrobe asking for a massage.
He got lost on the way to Notre Dame.
I just hope he doesn't knock my plant off.
Here’s the weird part—he thinks today is Thursday.
Let me call you back, Quasimodo is going to sing again.
It's all about positioning.
Darling, don't park your car near the cathedral.
The new place also overlooks the cathedral's flying butthead.
Stalking is a welcome break from that bell.
Actually, mother, Kevin is an up-and-coming musician who has a lot on the ball.
Can I call you back? The neighbor won’t stop ringing the bell.
Hmm? Oh, its nothing. Just another predator staring at me.
The rest of us can still be neighbors
Well, how can you tell if he's a parkour guy or, like, Quasimodo?
Lover's Leap
Please turn off all cell phones, and enjoy the performance.
You are always on the phone!
Hello, Father? Don't you people have a bathroom?
The buildings here are like characters.
He's back again this year to try and convince me to root for the Irish when they play USC.
Wonderful exhibit on the evolution of Cervidae Erectus
Just remembered- gotta call my chiropractor.
yeah he's still there....god i hope he doesn't take another crap!
Oh, like, you know - Phantom of the Opera, Sponge Bob, something like that.
I said you should come see my new 'potted plant!'
NYPD? Do you still have those armed biplanes?
I know it's hard to find a straight guy in Manhattan, but he can't look like Quasimodo.
Sure, it's impressive, but it's still not a sport.
I dunno, Clair -- He just keeps shouting "Sanctuary City, Sanctuary City!"
I’ll call you back. Quasimodo’s about to drop in.
There's some guy droning on about "precarious perches."
Here's the thing. He not only does wake up calls but dinner bells as well.
We have a Quasi Neighborhood Watch Progam.
The Hunch Back and Water Dame.
My name? It's Quasimodo. And you must be Ismeralda.
Hang on, my plant sitter is here.
It's some guy shouting about how he can make me a movie star
Quasimodo, please don't jump until the vine grows out.
I didn’t say ‘humpback whale’, I said, ‘Hunchback,’ Gail.
Yeah, well, life isn't a Disney movie.
Did you ring?
No, the name Quasimodo doesn't ring a bell.
May I use your toilet?
Let's just say I have a hunch his name will ring a bell...
Oh I almost forgot, Happy Hump Day.
After last night and you won't pick up!??!
No, officer, I’m not certain. It’s just a hunch.
It's not ringing a bell...
Honey..You need more balls than that to call yourself a Gargoyle!!
Just watch out for my plant when you jump over here--okay?
I am looking at, like, you know, the ugliest pigeon. EVER.
You should hear this dimwit try to say Noter Dame.
‘Yes, I am canceling my husbands chiropractor appointment... I have a hunch, he won’t be back.”
You know my neighbor? He's taken Halloween to a who new level.
Gargoyle, I said. G A R G O Y L E.
Yeah, I would say living next to Notre Dame has its pervs.
Yeah, I told him my name wasn't Esmeralda, that he should just climb down and ring a few more bells.
Hello 911. I want to report a peeping Tom.
I have a hunch that skydiver is back.
Hello James - please send up an extension ladder to apartment 1314.
I have a hunch it'll work out. We're both botanists.
Aha! Just like a thought, another fine specimen of Euphorbia erecta!
He claims ringing the bell helps his scoliosis.
I’m on top of the world.
[Be Cool Esmerelda] Yes, Roxy, I'd say he's "QUASI" cute
I really have to change my ringtone
Yes, your Grace, I am sorry about your pigeon problem, however...
That plant could fall off, you know!
Sleep-walking again, Harvey?
Monsignor, Will you please call Quasimodo down from the bell tower, he's staring again.
He is obviously very high and says he is lost. He has a French accent and is a hunchback. Keeps mumbling about Trump taking away his Visa and yelling "I am not a Muslim."
He says he's gonna jump, but he's much too good looking to be a stockbroker.
Come here often?
hi
I guess I'd describe him as Quasimodo if he were a better climber.
Hi Betty, I think I may have found that date for you. He's well up in the world, although he does carry a bit of baggage.
OK, I've distracted him; be quick about pulling out those bell clappers.
He calls me Esmerelda. I call him quasi-loco.
The new gargoyle seems to always be looking at you.
Apparently his pre-existing conditions don't include acrophobia.
Not pie and lattes. I said he's doing PILATES again.
The poor guy. Not only does he have chronic health issues, but he's been in the neighborhood so long no one knew he was a dreamer, too.
It's ugly at the top.
Just love the quasi-Parisian feel of my condo.
By the way, is Notre Dame having a good season this year?
Uh...I mean...I'm pretty sure he's taking a dump?
Yes, I see him
The hunchback of St. Patrick's is stalking me again.
Couldn't you just go with a nice simple cross?
Hello 911 ? There's a weirdo stalking me from above the cathedral.
Hello Officer, he is doing it again.
he says his name is TOM.
Honey, would please get off the phone and unlock the front door!
Our new security camera is giving me the creeps.
Loving Paris and getting use to its tourist bureau promos.
Hi, this is Esmeralda again. That creep with the hunchback is stalking me again from Notre Dame.
Hello, 911? I'd like to report a crouching tiger, peeping tom.
Hold on there's somebody hunching in
Hi Victor? This is Cosette. I think you sent the wrong bachelor.
A little creepy, I'll admit. But at least the damn bells have stopped ringing.
He's here to get his Tupperware back.
He claims he's Quasimodo, wants to ring my bell?
He's doing it again.
Any weekend plans? Bell tower and chill.
Somehow it rings a bell
Hold on. Do you do windows, Sweetie?
Grunting sound? Oh, that's just Harvey.
So Jump! I won't love you but I'll love your splatter.
Yeah, I like most of my neighbors, but I have a bad hunch about the guy who lives directly across from me.
Stalking was so much easier in the middle ages.
I'd like to report a code violation.
It seems that whenever I water my plant, he'll ring the bell and then just sit on the spire... Could he be Pavlov's love child, or is there something more sinister afoot?
Gotta go. My boyfriend Quasi is here.
I ruminate about your mother and what might have been.
I'm telling you, this guy has taken "peeping tom's" to a whole new level.
I hardly notice him anymore and I am quasi certain he is blind.
Hey girl, what are you doing this weekend? There's someone I'd like you to meet.
Nostradoofus is at it again.
'You were right when you said faith took him to a higher place.'
Hey, Sis. I think I found you a date for the prom.
I can't shake the feeling that I'm being watched.
No, I do not want to make a night of it with the ring-a-ding kid.
I am all for Gothic architecture, but I am not thrilled with the accompanying bell ringer.
I could describe him but I don't like to body shame people
Is his hair brown? Well, quasi...
My neighbor seems like a bit of a loner.
Yeah, I can't believe zoning was OK with this either.
He looks quasi-balanced.
That's right, Officer....he's definitely Episcopalian and I think he's vegan too.....
Correct, Quasimodo with a 'Q'.
Hello Moto...Quasimodo
Love is always a leap of faith.
We’re connected wirelessly, walk on over!
Yes Quasimodo also lives on the 14th floor.
Hold the line a moment, Esmerelda. There's a performance artist outside my balcony, and he seems to want some water.
Your place or mine?
I'm looking at him now. I really think you'd like him, Esmeralda.
You don't have a prayer.
The guys on this dating apse are so not my type
Hi Dad! My neighbor got a new table!
Well, I'll give him this, he's got ball.
Yes, I see him almost every day, but I'd call it a quasi-friendship.
Our new neighbor's got the hump that he doesn't have a balcony.
That cute guy is checking me out again!
We gave up on the Tower of Babel ages ago
How's Paris you ask? . . . fairy tales say it all.
Sorry, I can't talk now, Quasi, I'm on the phone.
Well for one thing he's a re-enactor.
He wants to jump right into a relationship and I'm not ready.
These days my life is like a musty old book I never bothered to read in high school.
I'd like to report a peeping Quasimodo.
He knows, that I know, that he knows he'll never be able to get over that gypsy girl. He can grovel all day if he likes, but I have a plant now. I have more important things going on in my life.
Yes, he thinks we should have gone with the gargoyle upgrade.
I'm really happy to see you, but I recommend using the elevator on the ground floor.
I'm really not into religious guys.
Really? That doesn't ring a bell.
I am guessing he may have back problems.
He's just another gross lech who won't take "no" for an answer.
I'm thinking it was a bad idea to move into the Victor Hugo.
He can't come to the phone right now. He's polishing the steeple.
Mom! I have a hunch he's giving me a ring!
I don't know. I guess he's starting to grow on me.
I can't tell whether it's a real Modo or a quasi-Modo.
No thanks, I like my ringtone.
Esmeralda, you've changed!
yeah, police. This creepy guy's just sitting on notre dame, staring at me.
You're right. The bell was made in Troy, NY...
And we've got a direct view of the Mad Friar's Cathedral...
I have to go, my boyfriend who rings my bells is here.
The audition went really well and I got a hunchback. I mean callback.
Will you at least meet with the chiropractor?
AND THEN, our eyes met.........
I'm not sure, but I think it may be a bald-headed cuckoo.
Esmirelda, please call 911. The bell rope broke.
Seriously, I've got a peeping hunchback.
Sorry, I have to go now. Mody's popping over.
I think he's saying "Hey, Ms." but I can't hear over the ringing bells.
No I don’t need a restraining order.
Yes, Melania, he's wearing that ugly green fleece you hate.
Hi Mom, Remember when I suspected a pigeon from the church yard was nibbling my kale plant? Well, I have a new theory...
need some fertilizer?
I mean... he's kind of a gargoyle but I think he's cute.
Did you hear the doorbell?
It's again my husband; he left the keys in the offering plate
Yes, the Feng Shui gargoyle balanced the view...
I don't get it.
No, it is not Jack be nimble..
I find the Squatting Deer series much more moving.
You get used to it, but I hear it's dragginig down property values across the street.
I'm hoping this will make him thirsty and he'll get off that stupid ball.
See me!
May I borrow your phone?
There's a gargoyle on my belfry.
It's just a hunch.
Ya Notre Dame Condos, they have everything!
Say what you may, he's on the ball this week.
I love it - it's my little sanctuary.
He wants to know if we'd like to receive a pledge card.
How do I know, he's fooling around!" "Let's just say I have a hunch.
"Don't re-set you Ringtone from Cosmic to Chimes, Esmeralda, unless you want to alert your neighbors. Believe me.
Ok, he says his name is Quasimodo, does that ring a bell?
Yes, Zelda, we are the first Sanctuary high rise on E 51st Street.
Hello, Animal Control? Yeah, it's back
Sorry to interrupt. Trying to get wifi.
I'll always have Paris
9-1-1, what is your emergency, please?
Is Rapunzel home?
This call is being monitored.
I hope it's thirst, and not lust.
Actually, officer, I'm calling about the priest outside my keyhole.
I think he's jealous of our rooftop garden.
He likes my 'Bell Tower' ringtone.
I wanted a park view but all I could afford was parkour.
New plant?
It's almost my sanctuary.
Yeah, since he's been up here I notice it hasn't needed as much fertilizer.
The carillonneur is exposing himself again.
Which one of us is the Peeping Tom?
...and his mouth is REALLY watering.
I like Paris, but sometimes it's like being in a gothic novel.
I really think an urban garden would help Quasimodo break this dangerous habit.
The landlord said it was a room with a view. I didn't know that I was to be the view.
He hasn’t swept me off my feet yet.
Not only does he ring that damn bell on the hour but he also has air rights.
I know the connection is bad, but if I stand on my balcony for five more minutes, I'll be starring in Harvey Weinstein's next picture.
"Victor, I've been thinking about it and all is can see is a big, gothic wedding".
One second mom, my neighbor is asking me if I have any sugar.
I guess I can’t be positive he’s a stalker.
He thinks Rex called him a "Moroni" not "Moron".
Does the name Esmerelda ring a bell?
Could I please speak to Victor?
He doesn't know how he got up there, and now he doesn't know how to get down.
The lift was out of order
Nope, he still hasn't found a way down.
So, he waters my plants for me while I’m away for a couple of months and now he’s like, Ring my bells???
Toss me some bottled water and I'll play church bells for your next dinner party.
Yeah Mom: He still thinks He's Spiderman!
Paris just isn't what it used to be.
Six days and still no handstand.
I don't know Mom, he's calling it a "leap of faith."
Do you ever feel you can't escape the male gaze?
I forgot my selfie stick
Gotta go. Quasimodo's here.
I don’t know...His face doesn’t ring a bell.
QuasiDodo is back
I climbed all the way up here for this?
I know, but he's so cute.
I wish he would wear pants.
My new boyfriend is a religious, hunch backed, jumping herbivore. He’ll be here in a moment.
The good-night kiss was okay, but I didn't hear bells or anything.
No, no, no! This is NOT a sanctuary city.
Creepy Quasimodo I can deal with. It's the noon day bells that are really driving me crazy.
Yay, it's Rush week at Julliard again! Party at my flat 5pm
At least he keeps the pigeons away...
I wonder if this really is a welcoming and accepting community.
Yeah, that 'Sanctuary?' pickup line of his is getting old.
911, my ex-boyfriend is quasi irritating again.
He says he'll jump unless I get him a Groupon for a chiropractor.
Do you have the number for Sanctuary in the East Village?
I disagree, the government has elevated its surveillance efforts,
It's northwest of the cathedral. That's right. The NoWeNoDa neighborhood.
I’ve got to go Eileen. The Hugo’s hunchback is on the roof again and I need to call the fire department.
I think my dad wants me to go to the University of Notre Dame.
I like his perspective.
Hold on a sec Mom, the guy that keeps me up at night with his bell tolling is outside.
it's like my own urban sanctuary
Are you even getting a quasi signal?
Parkour peeping Tom.
Daddy, you sent me to the wrong Notre Dame. But I love it!
Yes, Uncle Victor, I'm having a wonderful time in Paris. It was SO SWEET of you to let me use your condo this summer! However, you really didn't need to ask the guy next door to keep an eye on me.
I will have to call you back, my personal plant fertilizer is here.
Let's just say I think he's quasi-interested in me.
He's just crouched there like a statue.
What do you mean, ‘It’s already been written’?
Hello 911? I've gotta flagpole sitter that's going to expose himself. Like the 39th floor. No problem, I'll hold.
Me? I am looking at a fine execution of church steeple Asana!
And of course his name is Tom.
I'm not making eye contact, I promise. Postmodernism is too far a leap.
Wouldn't you know—a peeping hunchback!
Do you think he'll take song requests when he rings the bell?
I have a sort of quasi-relationship with him.
Psst! Ever do the roots thing?
Can't put my finger on it but his face sure rings a bell.
...And I can't call the cops because he claimed, 'Sanctuary' or something.
It’s my hunch that he got his bell rung, out in the back of Notre Dame.
I'm a gentrifier? He's a hunchback living in a cathedral. Compared to him we're ALL gentrifiers!
Yes, living in Paris is amazing. My new apartment is in the centre of everything, just a hop, skip and a jump away from Notre Dame.
Hold the line, Esmeralda.....he's actually right on the ball!
I think I am going to drop my Curves membership and signing up for CrossFit.
'gotta go, my parkour instructor just got here"
From this angle you are doing a great job.
No MSG on mine.
He still thinks he's Quasimodo, but at least he's stable for now.
Ding-dong, check out my schlong!
Well, there are ICE vehicles below.....and he's yelling "Sanctuary! Sanctuary!"
Oh jeez, it's that hunchback from across the street again. Hang on... "Hey, Moe, how's it going?"
He says his name is sort of "Modo."
The new bell is wifi -- he rings it with an app; so now the belfry is open to tourists from nine and five.
Have I told you about my new neighbor?
Well, sure, he's a hunchback, but he follows me and likes everything I do, so...
I just reached landmark status.
No, he's not a plant, I said I'm watering my plant!
well, officer, a REAL modo would have rung the bell first
Hello? St. Patrick's? Your gargoyle is acting up again!
I've decided to name my plant, "Victor." It just came to me.
You haven't heard ? Well, Tom and I have separated.
Yes, I do like my new neighborhood. It has such a thriving literary scene.
Hang on a sec, Hunchie has the munchies.
I will have to move. Squatters on the twenty-seventh floor can be quite annoying.
Gladys, "have you ever seen a pants less peeping tom?"
You seem to have found work-life balance
I can see your house from here.
I wouldn’t say he’s what you’d call a traditional peeping Tom, but I’m creeped out big time. And, the only thing he’s ever said to me is, “Hi Esmeralda.”
It will hatch, it will hatch, it will hatch, I just know it.
""...and you also better bring a large pair of tighty whities." '
His name is Tom.
Quasi motivated
I see your back again.
Excuse me Sir, but--are you a Real-modo, or just a Quasi-modo?
I don't know who you're calling, miss. But I have a hunch.
It's still NO Quasi, and that's going to hurt your back.
No, you may not have a bite.
He keeps yelling "sanctuary," and I have no idea what he wants.
Finally! Someone who ring my bell!
What hump?
I keep telling him I am not Esmeralda .
I don't know Mom. What did you do when Dad acted like this?
Quasimodo is stalking me again.
No, not crazy. _Quasi_.
How do you like my new ringtone?
He’s called the Hunchback of Notre Dame, but he doesn’t look like a football player to me.
Not everything was better. You should see the pre-war balcony across the way.
Oh, did I tell you about my new neighbor, Quasimodo?
Sorry, hon, can't talk. Quasimodo's about to get here for brunch.
I'd like to report a peeping hunchback of Notre Dame.
The view isn't great, but the rent is low.
Igor, it's for you.
Remember I said I'd a hunch he'd be back?
We're going away so I hired a house plant sitter.
I can't believe that creep sent you a friend request. What a stalker!
Actually I do have someone in my life right now
Would you have some bird seed?
You draw water, I draw crowds!
Oh, #102 5th Ave, not #100. Well, at least I got the 32nd floor right.
Somebody is ready for a "leap of faith"!
No, David, I asked if you would climb any mountain, not climb any steeple.
The church still hasn't installed a bathroom.
He begs for water every morning. It's adorable.
He brought the wrong pizza.
Anyway Sarah I gotta go, my Super Squats trainer is here.
I'd say I am in a quasi relationship
He's the boy next door, but he's not MY boy next door.
On second thought, I'll call you back.
I had a hunch he'd come back from Trump Tower
I think I'm going to have to change my Notre Dame ring tone on my phone.
Your name rings a bell ... who did you say you're with again?
I found him on TaskRabbit.
Hang on a sec. My quasi-boyfriend wants to ask me something.
Well, he keeps saying "Sanctuary" and pointing at my plant.
Well if you’re leaning prewar I may have something coming available soon.
He's fixated on my Esmeralda plant, Julie.
The belles, the belles.
Hello police, There's a man staring at me and I have a hunch he's up to no good!
Why do some men think this is romantic?
Yes, I'm watering it now. Uh, okay. hold on... Hey, mister, Esmeralda says hi.
Remember when mom said she had a hunch about this apartment?
I know this may seem a bit awkward but I'm really not stalking you!
No, I said 'it's a peeping Quasimodo,' Tom.
By any chance is your name Esmeralda?
Yeah, the babysitting job is going well.
Yes, mom. I know I'm never home and I know that a healthy plant needs to be spoken to regularly. I believe I've got that covered.
Hunchback of the Upper West Side
Stop calling me, you know I can't answer.
I'll ask him.
He says he's just a gargoyle, but I'm not buying it.
Esmeralda, is that you?
Hold on, someone just found my sanctuary.
Someone needs to tell Don Jr. that I don't need my plumbing fixed.
Sherry, I'm going to have to call you back. The higher power is staring at me again...
Well, he's a dead ringer for the hunchback of Norte Dame.
Atleast he's not in the shower this time.
GARGOYLE, mother, I said I am falling in love with a GARGOYLE!
Listen Liz I'll call you back, I've got a peeping "gnome".
No, he only watches my plant. I'm going to need you to water it.
I’m not sure if I’m seeing things but I see a blob in front of me.
It's no biggie...he's just a quasi-stalker.
Thanks, this is my sanctuary.
My steeple? No cross. No angel.......
Yeah, he keeps calling me 'Esmerelda.' Is that weird or what? I feel like I should throw him a cracker or something. I mean, how many gargoyles can talk? So anyway, what I told Wayne about Shirley was...
I'm not sure where our son is, but I have a hunch.
I get it; parkour.
It's a studio unit, nice airy feeling, with a view . . . and it just went coop. Call me!
There's a guy out here who says he's from 2048, via 1482.
So my new boyfriend isn’t quasi-anything. He’s the real thing!
Yeah, he's still there. He acts like he thinks its not over between us, but he's got a hunch.
I have a hunch that I'm being watched.
Weird Neighbors
Are we hosting Notre Dame in this week's game by any chance?
Hello, Victor. Hugo is peering at me again.
He keeps coming up here when my ringtone says, "Hello Moto."
Yeah, well, looks aren't everything and he puts me on a pedestal...
No, I specifically requested the halfback who plays for Notre Dame.
"I always water my plants on Hump Day".
You were right. I did need glasses.
I have no hunch why he’s there
A little to the left
That's right, we've casted Quasimodo as the next Spiderman.
That guy who maintains the place across the street looks quasi-familiar.
Fern whom the bell tolls.
He says it's just lunch.
No, I was looking for someone with a good BANK balance...
That damn humpback is STILL stalking me - help!
I'm just calling in in, OK? He looks set to do a doody on the people below any second now!
I know, 'love is like a tree.' But he's really into this houseplant.
It's like he's too emotionally available or something.
My phone model? Quasi-Moto.
I’m calling to cancel my cable subscription
I don't know why I think of the balcony as my sanctuary, but I do.
Wait, hold on, Deb. Trump-goyle dropped his wig & his phone.
This is weird, he know my name is Rapunzel
If that was your new ringtone, Relda, it's absolutely through the roof.
Can you spare a small glass of water?
My neighbor thinks I over water my plants.
I suppose your bell ringer might just be dehydrated, Father, but it's creepy just the same
Really? What a coincidence. Me too!
I know, but can't he keep his religious views to himself?
There may be some lingering resentment.
...one brown eye, hunched back, and no pants....no idea how tall he is...
Yeah, he's French, kinda cute, a musician and available.
Let's just say I now HATE that "Hello 'Moto" commercial.
"But Esmerelda, it's not safe for you outside the Cathedral, although, I must admit, you do get a splendid sense of isolation up here.
The new gargoyles seem so life-like.
Yes, I did say I wanted to study humpbacks, but as in whales!
It was probably a matter of time before 'dangerous succulent watching' became a thing.
Errrrr, Esmerelda? I think I've got myself into a spot of bother.....could you call 911?
Marco....!
No, so far it's only a Quasi-Modo.
Hello police! There's some nut in a holloween costume stalking me!
I have to go now, Jim’s home.
Got rid of the beetle eating my plants but now there's a parish beadle without his pants.
Do you know if it's Wednesday yet?
I've got a guy who watches the place when we're away.
I've got to hang up—someone needs to use my bathroom.
He's ringing like 24/7.
Seriously, you reporters would do anything for a buck.
I said I had other plans....but he did stick the landing
Yeah, Airbnb listed this place as a 'sanctuary.'
I have a hunch.
Front desk? Hi, it's Esmeralda in 12C. The peeper's back.
I'd like to report a peeping hunchback, please.
No balcony. He lives in one of the older buildings.
Hang on, Peeping Quasimodo is back
Esmeralda, listen, I have special manure!
Ryan seems to think the belfry career impresses me.
Come on Quasi, it's not like you didn't see it coming.
Yes Mr. President. I will try to convince him to stand. Notre Dame is his French Lieu of sanctuary after all.
It's some creepy neighborhood kid. Harvey, I think. Or, Donald, maybe?
Seriously Esmeralda, I would call him. He looks like he might do something drastic.
He keeps saying, 'She gave me water.'
He's adorably creepy and better than the plastic owl!
Call your hunch back. He misses you.
The Halloween pop-up is next door.
It feels like the whole world is waiting for him to land nut first.
911, I want to report another steeple-assisted suicide try.
Same old, same old...nothing exciting on this front.
Just my luck, I got a hunchback peeping Tom.
It's a monument to quasi-architecture.
Mommy! Mommy! Why am I running in circles?” “Shut up, or I’ll nail your other foot to the floor.
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?
Welcome Quasimodo, may I offer you some water?
This guy from Notre Dame either said he's a hunchback or a halfback.
The sunny side of the building gets Tigger.
He wants me to call 1X-1-1.......
No, he's still up there. When he admits he was wrong!
"Quasimodo has finally reached the pinnacle of his life." Joe Pitts, Washington, DC
Yeah, I'll say it's the dark side of the building.
I have a hunch, I'll find more drama in this new condo.
One of those predatory priests has been exiled to a place he can do no further damage. I hope this plant grows fast.
You can take the prince out of the frog, but you can't take the frog out of the prince.
He says that I remind him of someone named Esmeralda.
oh, hey neighbor!
Yes, the new bishop’s assistant really is on the ball.
Once you feed them once, you just can't get rid of them!
The good news is he's stopped ringing the bell...
Hold on a sec. I have a hunch a certain someone is back.
I have a feeling he's not on Facebook.
Just watering the plants. . .what the blank?!?
I love you.
''...and then, you simply make a right at Notre-Dame, you can't miss''
I'm not sure what he's doing, but his name rings a bell.
Betsy, you won't believe it? Vince forgot his pants again.
Yeah, apparently he's got a a chip on his shoulder about gentrification or something. Or, uh, a hunch on his back, I don't know - ugh, these people should've moved out years ago!
If a Quasimodo isn't a new phone, then what is it?
Yes, I do usually swipe right on Catholic boys. Why do you ask?
You blinked first.
The guy who thinks he is a bird is still there
Careful with that pot, lady.
Caviar? Do you have a drone service? I have this friend...
He insists he came back as a bird.
I'd like to report a peeping hunchback. Sure, I'll hold.
The view is spectacular--a gothic church, bell tower, with its very own hunchback!
Yes, officer. He's middle aged, balding and keeps asking if I want to watch him ring his bells.
I have the strangest sense that I'm being watched.
I think they’re getting ready to tear the church next-door down
Steeples, pants, plants, I guess he is against something.
He's staring at me like he knows me, but doesn't ring any bells.
Hi Quasi - I heard you ring the bell this morning.
Yes, Father, did you water the hunchback today?
So tell me, officer, does my description ring any bells?
I'm visiting your downstairs neighbor do you think you could lend me a ladder
No, he’s a REAL Modo! I’ll send you a pic.
They're filming the new Marvel movie across the street. I think casting Mickey Rooney as the new Spider Man was a stretch.
"I have a hunch he's back".
So, who rings your bell?
‘The new place?’ Urban contemporary with penthouse view of hunchback on steeple.
I know he's not my type, but suddenly I hear wedding bells.
OK, Goggle..What is the going rate for a bell ringer?
I told him exactly what you said: “Sanctuary? Quasi, don’t ring those damn things again until they are wedding bells.”
Jesus Christ, I have to go to the bathroom.
I appreciate the call, but it's just a routine check from the condo board.
He says he's protesting the lack of French cathedrals in Manhattan.
This was more fun when it was forbidden.
Looks like my neighbor is trying to get the perfect selfie again.
Let's just say our sanctuary city has reached a new height.
Here is a guy who is either asking me out or jumping to death because of me
Please join us for the lunch back at Notre Dame.
I have a hunch my neighbor is spying on me.
I've never made it this far in Frogger before
Quasimodo I presume.
Does the name Quasimoto ring a bell?
He's not spying. He's subletting.
He followed me from Paris. I had an apartment across from Notre Dame.
Can you tell me how to get back to the Parcour event?
No. He's still down there.
That's not what I mean when I said you needed to "get on the ball" at school.
I can barely understand him but I think he wants to ring my bells.
Do I call him Kwahsee-modo or Kwayzai-modo?
Thanks for letting me know, the plant needed to be watered.
So this is what heaven is like ?
Uh-huh! Yeah, I know! So...now that the whole stalker business us behind me, my biggest worry is whether this plant on my balcony might be in a precarious spot...
"It's your chiropractor. Can you come in at noon"?
Yeah, apparently my ringtone peaked his interest.
911? What's the PC term for "hunchback" jumper?
I ruv you a rot.
It's okay Cynthia, he just wanted to let me know that my plants need watering.
I'm looking at a complete pervert...
Have you seen Esmerelda?
Dad? No, everything is fine, got in last night, fed the cat, watering the plants, and the chimney sweep is here, but for one thing, you don't have a fireplace, right?
You are clearly the tops in New York real estate.
Yeah, he just sits there and waits for the phone to ring.
I'll call you right back, I have a Quasimodo situation. I'll have to call you back, right now I have a Quasimodo situation.
Some sicko has put a gnome on the dome.
Honey, if you think the pigeons are bad this year---just wait!!
Funny you should mention Lon Chaney.
Is the place below you available?
I guess I'd say I'm "Quasi" seeing someone...
He thinks he still plays football.
No, he doesn't ring any bells!
He keeps shouting "sanctuary," but we aren't a sanctuary city.
I'll take Notre Dame +3. I dunno, just a hunch.
...no, I haven’t met any cute neighbours yet.
"Hello Moto" really confused him until I changed my ringtone.
My imp is threatening to jump again .
As if getting to the top is not enough. Danny wants to do it in style!
Yes, he does bear a striking resemblance to Steve Bannon........minus the hunch of course.
It's just a hunch, but I think he's back.
The ringtone, the ringtone, the ringtone!
No we haven’t met, but his texts are so sweet.
Oh, I don't mind - he's kind of cute.
I’d like to report a peeping hunchback.
"Oh, he's doing well, but his Tinnitus is getting worse"!
Either he goes or you go, Victor!
It’s lonely at the top.
911, I'd like to report a Peeping Tom.
No other apartments in Paris had better views than The Quasimodo.
Polo-?! Oh come on, my quads are killing me...
Gloria, I gotta go. The neighbor's here asking to borrow a cup of sugar.
I always say, if you have a hunch, follow it.
I have a hunch about this place.
But mom,he has a steady job
Gotta go; there's a guy perched on the bell tower who's about to go bald if I don't water his head.
Let me know when lunch is ready and I will hop right over.
He's Quasi-Quasimodo at best.
Yes, he is on top of his tower peeping again!
Just hanging out...watering my plant "Quasi."
Blame Victor Hugo, Shakespeare made it easy for Romeo.
Remember when there were pigeons?
He says I inspire him.
Yes, I see you’ve been on the ball lately, but no, I still think we’re going nowhere.
It's like Quasimordor over here.
Well, its view is great. But it is much too small.
It's amazing what a man will do for a well-watered plant.
Greg didn’t have cable, nor a sense of privacy.
Yes officer, it's about my husband. He took a dare...
Well, he says he's looking for sanctuary and a toilet
What hump?
He going to swing over and pick me up
I don't mind, we are a quasi-sanctuary city.
And like, there’s this hunchback who keeps staring at me?
I've got a hungry guy here with a question about pizza delivery... Is it still free if delivery takes more than 45 minutes?
Yes, I am at church but some troll is staring at me so I will have to call you back tomorrow mom.
Sarah thought her boyfriend was too clingy...
I guess I misunderstood what they meant by cathedral ceilings.
There's no bathroom in the bell tower.
I have a hunch you don't like me.
The Hunchback of Boca Raton
Don't mind me, Ma'am. I am just your friendly neighborhood homeless man.
hey give me a sec... Quasi is stalking me again..
Alice, you told me that our place to see the sunrise and sunset was attached to the flower garden!
I don't know if he's a real threat or not. He just keeps leering at me and yelling, 'Sanctuary! Sanctuary!'
No Mom, I did not ask him over.
I think the tenant association would be fine with letting him stay there if he wasn't constantly screaming at all hours for someone named Esmeralda.
It’s just a medium hunchback. How is yours?
Can you hear me now? I said "This is stalking, with bells on"
The cathedral itself was a nice touch to Tribeca although the view's a little Disney for me
Yes, he rings a bell.
I'm just saying, add a wig and it could be him. Nobody else sits like that.
Q! You want whipped creme on that Bellringer Latte.
Swipe left? Swipe right? Do sensitive eyes really count?
Hello, HouseHunters? This wasn't what I meant by 'Parisian Charm'.
Those were dark days when humans drove cars.
I told him he wasn't on my level.
The view? Sometimes the moon looks like it's right in front of me.
It's a Quasi-Motorola.
I don't know if he's on Facebook.
Will you go out with me?
Monsignor? I'd like to order a better gargoyle.
...and those those social-climbing outsiders? For the birds, I tell you!
Yep he is here again...
Mouse!
Hey girl, you look Notre-DAMN fine,
I'm not asking him where he buys his tights!
Do you mind?
Historic or not, I have a hunch you're not going to like the view.
Snapchat THIS, Quasi!
His face definitely rings a bell...
The Hunchback of Trump Tower is back from the Cabinet Meeting.
Quasimodo considers a degree in horticulture.
What I love about this place is the privacy.
I want my wake-up call to be moved up an hour.
I'm telling you, he's European and very athletic. Just wait till he shows you his music studio.
These city pigeons seem to get bigger and bigger
Why do I keep thinking about Quasimodo? I haven't read that in years.
Hold on, the bellhop has a message for me...
He's looking at me again.
Yes, to day he made it to the top
Can you call 911 to help me down from here?
If this creep comes any closer, he's dead.
He just crapped on the roof.
I have a hunch. I think you can jump this far . . . and then you can ring MY bell.
You'll never guess what happens when I water my hostas.
Hold on, the hunchback of the neighborhood is about jump madam.
When you try to do the impossible.
He wants to know if there's an open spot in our Pilates class this afternoon.
It's a Hollywood gargoyle.
The Bell Tower Boy's taking another bathroom break.
Oh, hi Vic. Esmeralda here. I’ve got two tickets to the Notre Dame game. Wanna go?
I'm quasi-busy tonight.
Plants are fine but, tell me, who’s your cute yogi neighbor?
No, I said, "Peeping Hunchback of the Bell Tower Next Door."
I want a guy who really rings my bell.
Hey Clara, I have to go, yeah..my date's here.
I've got to go; I'm expecting someone to drop in at any moment.
I could have sworn that you said “quarter” back...
He's not that cute -- but his Tinder name is totes amazeballs. Have you ever heard "Quasimodo" before in your entire life?
He's out of the bell tower again, and needs some help.
I'm not sure I should trust that "boy next door" thing.
Yes, yet another gargoyle...
I don't even notice the hunch anymore.
Yeah, the rent is low...but the view is boring.
It looks like the building next door has rooftop yoga.
There are some disadvantages to residential infill.
The son rises early on the Upper East Side
When I asked you to bring me a flower stalk, I didn’t mean a flower stalker.
Actually Mom, the new cell tower has only made the connection worse.
Esmeralda, you're over watering it again.
I doubt he has a girlfriend. Just a hunch.
They call me The Pervert of Notre-Dame.
Did I tell you about the new acid yoga place downstairs? It's amazing.
He just keeps mumbling "forgive us our trespasses"
I've been trying to ring you all morning.
I know he's harmless, but he really creeps me out.
I suppose he has a certain quasi-Gothic appeal.
The large balcony is a bonus. Few buildings have the luxury of a usable outdoor space.
Well, Ancestry.com says I'm 1.7% Gypsy. Why?
Remind me how the movie "hunchback of noted dame" ended
I think this hunchback I'm looking at rings a bell.
I think his name starts with "Q"
Spire, Aspire, Expire spire, aspire, expire Spire, Aspire, Expire
There's this Middle Age creep who's eyeing me. I guess he knows I'm Middle Age too.
I want a man who'll go to the ends of the earth for me.
Yeah, but you know I have a thing for creepy stalkers.
Yes Mom, I am seeing someone right now
Yeah, I don’t think he knows what ‘social climbing’ means.
Hold on, my nosy neighbour needs sanctuary again.
Oh, it must be wednesday !
Gotta go. The boyfriend wants to chill and Netflix.
How far away is Florida as the crow flies? Some guy is asking me for directions.
I hear bells ring and thought it was my cell phone.
I'd call the Time Police but then they might wonder how I knew their number.
Girl, I’m so ready to settle down that I’m beyond looks.
Hello father?... your new verger was just arrived by drone.
You won’t believe who’s stalking me again. Yes! Harvey Weinstein’s making his bio-pic.
Quazimoto, dear, please swing by the store and pickup some milk for dinner!
I'm preparing a salad for a guest. You?
Save some for me.
There are rooftops, then there are rooftops.
Hey! I'm walking' here.
All I know is that if he doesn't stop peeping into my apartment, I'm gonna ring his bell.
Hello, Acme Seed Company, maybe I've been overwatering, but, um, there seems to be a big problem with my order of magic beans.
Hi, do you know anything about aphids?
Well, a quasi-boyfriend I would say.
I've got a Hunch, we've got a peeping Tom.
I feel bad for him too...but you can't live in a bell tower.
Lets meet for hunch...I mean lunch.
He's back. Have a hunch?
I just knew there would be a downside to this penthouse.
The zoning regulations went through.
He keeps calling me Esmeralda. Weird, huh?
Not much, just watering the Esmeralda.
I've been coyly hoping our church's cute hunchback would show some interest in me, and I think he's about to do so with a great leap.
Just about to start my " Quasi-exercise class ".
Yeah it’s kinda weird but his property value now is probably like woah so I get it
Yes, Marie, on top of the Cathedral! The length these peeping toms will go to!
He must have skipped the Seminary class on Cardinals.
Esmeralda 2.0 makes me horny.
He's cute, but I don't believe him. He couldn't even sing the fight song.
Yea, that's just Quasimodo, still thinking I'm Esmeralda in need of rescuing!
Thanks for the offer, but I am really not interested in dating a vision challenged, hearing impaired, athletic and not afraid of heights, man with back problems, who lives in a church bell tower, at this time.
I've got a hunch that creepy guy is back.
....and they put a quasi-statue on the roof!
His advisor requires him to go higher than the last grad student before he can defend.
Hey, Hugo? Listen. I know you feel sorry for the guy, but he's actually kind of creepy.
Batty's up and I'm on deck.
Can you hold for a sec? I'm getting a drone delivery.
Yeah, I thought I was moving next to the university too...
If nothing else, I've learned that 'gentrification' is actually a French word.
It's not the ringing I detest.
I'm really into his rugged good looks, but all the undying love and devotion is just too old school for me.
DISNEY IS ANIME
My creepy neighbor claims he's meditating my garden, not me.
Gotta go. The guy is here to fix the washer.
....and he's not wearing any pants either.
The hump is back
Yeah, my neighbor Quasimodo wants to know if there are any apartments available?
Esmeralda, I don't know what it is, but whenever I water your plants, I'm always reminded what a sanctuary you have in this crazy city.
I've a hunch my plant will recover.
He wants a recommendation for a good back doctor.
I can't help but feel like I’m a really bad example of Gothic architecture.
Please, blow me a kiss so I can hop down.
I think they told me he was the quasi-bell ringer.
No, I'm just making a salad for a neighbor.
Yes, I suppose it's my fault for misunderstanding the meaning of "balcony view" in the real estate listing.
Finally, it's his turn to take a leap of faith.
No, he's definitely not fully modo.
Why do I think I’m being watched? Just a hunch.
Love the new place, quirky neighbors though!
I think I’ve spotted that bald eagle everybody’s looking for.
Well, he is kinda cute.
If I take a selfie it will just encourage him.
Do you happen to have any Doan's pills?
No it's ok, keep talking, for a moment I thought I heard the doorbell...
You will barely recognize Notre Dame.
Yes...9-1-1? The vigilante: 'Fatman'? I'm calling in another sighting.
I had a hunch you'd like this Cathedral Bell plant.
Yeah, so after I told Frollo to buzz off his wingman stepped up thinking he had a chance!
For some reason I have the urge to rename my cat "Sanctuary."
I'd list it as a pre-war walk-up with 360 views, utilities included.
Yes, I own the air rights.
3BR, 2BA with a quasi view of the Bell Tower.
Are you stalking me?
Hi, realtor? It's Becky. I need a new place. That Quasi Modo doesn't know what "no, I'm not interested" means.
it's for you, hang on a minite
Esméralda I have to go...there's a staring contest afoot!
I told him 'relax -- we're a sanctuary city.'
This is worse than a bird problem.
That weird dude who always screams about 'sanctuary' is back. Huh? No, he's not really a stalker. He's more like a quasi-stalker.
I gotta go, Liz. Aiden's coming over.
He doesn’t look like a “Tom”
The guy from Notre Dame keeps looking in our apartment.
Have to call you back Sal, OK Cupid Premium has done it, I actually miss those disgusting selfies.
I guess on-line dating can be better than high-rise trysts.
That Disney princess test on facebook was so right!
Esmeralda? Sorry wrong number.
Yes, you can tell spring is just around the corner.
He has his idea of sanctuary and I have mine.
He says he's very famous..."The what back of what honey?"...I'm pretty sure he's foreign
It's not only that I'm stuck, I can hardly imagine what anyone else would submit.
I wonder which plant that is
He says the top of the UC Berkeley campanile is still university property so he's entitled to free speech.
Yes, Fire Department? I have a 'cat stuck in a tree' situation, but instead of a cat, it's my husband, and a church steeple instead of a tree.
And it looks like he might be the one who stole my other plant.
The apartment is lovely, and the neighbors are just too eager to meet us!
I told him not to stand up there, but he says it's only Quasi-dangerous.
Yeah, I know the feeling: every morning, my downstairs neighbor thinks he's a pigeon.
It is not the hood that makes a monk. As is the evil so is the remedy
So this deformed guy keeps staring at me, but he seems harmless. Maybe I should offer him some water?
Yeah, I'd say his training for Ninja Warrior is going well.
This is Esmerelda, remember what you were saying about the view from my terrace."
They're too cheap to buy a drone, I guess.
He says he was a fullback at the University.
I don't know, it just never seems as real onstage.
No, no, don't get me wrong, I think it's great that Quazimodo has learned parkour.
Can I sell you a living will?
There is an 'Emoji for Love' in front of me.
You think your neighbors make a lot of noise, try bells every hour on the hour.
Laughton...no sounds like L-A-W-T-O-N. Yeah, that's who he looks like...and he has no pants.
Sorry to bother you while you're away, but your ex is telling me to give them plant food...
I'd call it quasi-scenic.
Fancy seeing you here.
No, Quasi, my bell does not need rung, thank you
No...I said the 'hunchback,' not the 'quarterback.
Does running water always release your own?
No gardening tips, thanks! Do feel free to awkwardly stare at me while I sleep though!
He must be from Paris
I know this is a "sanctuary" city, but this is getting ridiculous!
I love this neighborhood but the gentrification is just out of control.
Hello 911??? I have an ogre ogling me
And another thing I find quasi-creepy—he always has to be on top.
The Bell tolls for you.
I've got a hunch my neighbor is stalking me.
Homeboy is def not wearing pants lol OH SHIT yo the shrooms are hitting p. hard rn like is this even real whuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
I'm just quasi on the ball with my plant watering.
Yes, I know it says all about how close he is allowed to get, but it does it say anyting about building a cburch spire to stand on so he can see in?
Well, you can have nosy neighbors anywhere, right?
My hunchback neighbor is so cute. I think he thinks I'm, like, his Esmeralda or something."
I have a hunch I'm being stalked.
I think it's the hunchback of nasturtiums.
What's the French word for "peeping tom"?
I don't care if he is meditating,get him down!
I thought you said to give you a ring sometime.
This whole gothic phase thing is very different from when we were teenagers.
It will be easier if we face time next!
I said HAMILTON tickets, not HUNCHBACK tickets!
hang on, i am being quasi stalked
I was wondering if you would like to go out for a cup of coffee sometime?
Yes, I've just signed him up for aerial yoga.
We see eye to eye on the matter.
I get that we live in a sanctuary city, but does he literally have to shout it from the roof top?
Juliet come with me. This time the ending would be different. I promise.
Says he was at Notre Dame, sounds like he played in the backfield, but he doesn't look like a football type of guy.
Hold on, Quazimoto wants to say hi.
Old creepy guy, or Prince Charming? Just hop already.
Pants-less parkour is a very big thing here.
A gargoyle is taking a dump on the church steeple!
can i borrow your little brother's slingshot? the gargoyle is back again
Have you seen my back pack?
I knew what Pollock was all about but this is beyond words.
I come here to discuss the merger.
"The strangest thing- my new neighbor wants me to pour molten metal on my potted plant and knock it off the ledge".
Finally, I'm starting to meet some neighbors.
Phoebus, when you're done will you take my new profile pic.
They cut down the tree I usually watch you from...
Now will you marry me?
Yes he’s staring at me right now. I don’t know his name but his his face rings a bell.
Oh, Hey Esme...no: same old, same old.
I meant the bell in the lobby.
These virtual reality ring tones are great!
I asked him to start our taxes and now he won't stop screaming "sanctuary!"
Do you have a few moments for our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ?
He does surprisingly well on social media.
I have a hunch the Fighting Irish will win.
I love the quaint reminders of the old neighborhood.
I'm thirsty
I'm not buying the "came of age in a different culture" excuse.
I GOT TIRED OF OF ADMIRING YOU FROM AFARWe
I need to hang up. My date is here.
The hunchback Harry meets Sally.
I'll tell you, honey, those new glass doors out to the terrace really live up to their name
He's a ringer for that guy you're looking for.
He's a musician and into heavy metal.
The Hunchback of Peeping Tom
All he told me on the phone was "Essie, it has a quasi-perfect view of a church ... a ringer for Notre Dam".
If you insist, you might as well fertilize my plant....
.... a cup of sugar?
Hey, Esmerelda, there is a guy here who says he knows you!
'Yeah, he's small, but doesn't look particularly French.'
I feel I have really good insights into the Trump base.
You can have your hunch back, I have my own.
No, it's their Half back.
I had a hunch the view wasn't all it was cracked up to be.
Why are you calling me when you know I don't have my cell phone?
The Hunchback of Peeping Tom
He wants to borrow a wok so that he can iron his tunic.
...not too much, just watching parkour.
This vine grows to 50 feet in a couple of months so hang on until you can swing over here.
I'm being stalked by my ex-boyfriend. Guy with a hump. Ring any bells?
There's this guy playing leap-frog on the bell tower.
If it takes forever, I will wait for you.
I have friends in high places...
I dunno but his face rings a bell.
well, his face doesn't ring any bells for me {for Sarah}
Well, Nancy, as Popeye would say, he looks a lot more "gar" than "goyle"
Siri!" "What is Google Ogre watching me for?
Did you remember to add fertilizer?
I'm parched up here.
I can only be with a man who can rise above traditional religion.
I've long wished I had a little spot to grow something.
He says he's a pigeon.
..and speaking of our mother, you'll never guess who lives next door.
No, i'm not worried. I've been told this is a sanctuary city.
I won't do anything. I swear I won't. Just sit with me.
I know I'm attractive, Mom, but I just don't think he's all about ME.
Uh, I'll really have to call you back.
Siri, what does it mean when Superman doesn't completely leap a tall building with a single bound?
911? Yeah. The steeple peeper is back.
There is a strange guy next door who thinks I am Esmeralda.
I told him polishing it with his feet wasn't the best idea, but he is still there.
Hang on. You're about to get your bell rung.
I had a hunch I’d be seeing you again.
This week on 'Creepy Priests' caught on tape.
Did you know the church conversion was a walk up?
Ozie, you used the wrong door again.
Strange things started to happen after I installed this Esmeralda app on my phone.
“Your not gonna believe who’s checking on me again”.
I knew John had gargoyle on his resume, but I never thought he'd get a job so close!
Quick does falling water ALWAYS stimulate flow
It's working!
No, really. Don't hang up...I am the football coach here and I am smarter than Chip.
Why do I want to sell the apartment? I just have a hunch that now is the right time
If it's just the CO2, why does the plant only like it when he talks to it?
Well, he's not Weinstein-bothering me. He's quasi-bothering me.
My broker couldn’t even get me roof access.
It's an old model Quasimodorola phone but I still love the ringtone.
Not much, just another Esmeralda night.
He´s not being a dick, he´s being a cock - whaddyamean, that´s not funny?
No, I said 'holla-back'
I don't know if I should call 911 or water him.
Theoretically, we could have been happily married.
Hello, 911? Yeah, it looks like Quasimodo is gonna jump.
You really shouldn't use the term pervert, it's intrusive.
In many ways, the world is still in the dark ages.
Any last words?
I'm ignoring him, so are we going sightseeing today.
Look, Helen is 37 and she seldom has anything to say anyway. Why should the deafness be a problem?
So, he said something like I should go watch this halfback for Notre Dame, and, like, whatever, I don't even like baseball.
Mom, he's got a hunchback but, he really rings my bell.
The Hunchback's view of The Watering Dame
Think I've found a quarterback for the 'Fighting Irish'.
Well, he's kinda cute...has great balance...I really think he would be perfect for Lisa.
Hi, I'm Quasimodo. Will you be my friend? And maybe Like me on Facebook?
I'm not sure; I think he's seeking a bathroom.
Did the cathedral next get a new gargoyle, or what?
I can't decide if he's auditioning for a date with me or Americas Got Talent.
I ordered a Notre Dame football player and look what they sent me.
I don't know, another batty guy. He keeps saying, " Essie, it's Quasi".
I thought he was going to jump. Now I think he has to go potty!
Hello. The Vatican? I need to speak to the Pope.
Beware Esmeralda, Madame Guillotine awaits you!
ready,set,grow!!!!
I told him Esmeralda moved back to Paris, but he won't listen!
I have a hunch its the guy from last night.
It’s quasi creepy, but I think he’s harmless.
Yeah. And I have a hunch he'll be back in an hour.
He's looking at me again.
You're gonna have to speak up, I can hardly hear you.
The wind must be from the north.
Harvey, I'm calling the police.
I think the gargoyle on the church next door just yelled 'sanctuary'
I told him he could ring me later.
You want man or the money bag!
He's kinda funny looking, but he has a certain je ne sais quoi.
That guy I went out with is staring at me from the top of the bell tower - sweet or creepy?
No, I don't think I'm next to Sainte-Chappelle...
I didn't realize this was a sanctuary city.
Sure! Just as soon as I water the plants.
Guess what movie I just saw.
He's harmless. They're knocking down that stupid church soon to build condos anyway.
You know - Paris has really become an eclectic place.
New York is my sanctuary.
He says his name is something Modo and he hates the bell.
I love the new place, but did I tell you? I have a peeping Pom.
He's reliving his college days...I think it is one of those silly "sitting on top of things" thing. Last week he was eating the gold fish out of the tank.
He wants to borrow our lead smelter pot.
No - he wants you to hold the anchovies.
"Hunchback 2019" was a little-known sequel to the 1939 classic that was poorly received despite its depictions of urban sprawl and advances in communication technology that would turn out to be spot-on.
I understand that it's hard to get a job these days, but does he have to look right at me?
Yes, I believe it was Zen Greenleaf who said, 'Starve a disturbing dolt attention, then feed a plant and ignore said dolt.'
What's new? Oh, I don't know. Another dollar Another hunchback in the tower.
He's asking if this is a sanctuary city.
Captain Frollo? It's Esmeralda. That creep is looking in my window again.
Would you mind turning your ring off?
He is just sitting there, bawling.
I'm on my break from ringing those damn bells.
I'm thinking I need to get back into yoga.
How long have you been living there?
Hey Mom, it's Esmeralda. I closed today on that apartment I told you about with the view of the skyline .
I don't know who he is, but something about him rings a bell.
...Peeping Tom taking it to new heights
Hubert is going to extremes.
I've got a hunch your name's Esmeralda.
Le pauvre, il vit dans un immeuble super vieux.
Security? There is a flasher on top of the condo spire, singing "Happy Birthday Ella." My name is Maria.
I think she will notice me now...
Honey, Hamiltons sold out. Would Phantom tkts, front row, work?
You're just a dame. I show my haunch 'cause I'm the hunch at Notre Dame.
This is Esmeralda in 2110 and I think I have a stalker problem.
Hello? Mr. Hugo? Ummmm.
I have a hunch he is back because he is allergic to bell ringing.
On second thought, maybe I will buy that drone.
This halloween I'm going as a gypsy with my neighbor Quasi.
Exactly. I think he's finally seeing my side.
Parkour!
Let's do sex in the afternoon at your place today.
911 please state your emergency It's Esmeralda. The stalker is back and apparently he knows my name.
I think he's screaming, "Sanctuary City".
I'm just watering my bellflowers.
Police? How much do you charge to taze someone nowadays?
I don't know birds, but I think might be a hairy chested nutcracker.
I'm fond of him, but there's not physical connection.
Seems the bell ringer's been given a raise.
It's that nagging little hunch back again.
"Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos." "Beautiful day! Just a neighbor mumbling something in Latin about air rights!
Probably another handstand.
Sorry, gotta run. That kid across the way is about to sing "Out There" again, and I'm totally hooked.
peeping Thomas
I'm telling you, my plant does have a doppelganger.
Aspiring two a condo.
They don't care about us bucks.
He says he can redeem my soul for only 12 monthly payments of $19.95.
No Sally, nothing interesting happening around here.
Don't ignore me; we need to talk.
All I said was reach me on my cell phone.
Sorry, Esmeralda, I'm afraid it doesn't ring a bell.
Quick history lesson; the first gargoyle may actually have been a peeping Tom.
May I have a cup of water?
I don't know. Says his name is something modo and says if I don't marry him he will jump.
Quasimodo moved on to new interest.
A hunchback? No, doesn't ring a bell.
You know I don't believe in God, but I do think there's something there.
Yes, this is Leah again, your altar boy is pretending to be a gargoyle again!
It's worse than a wall.
No water for you, sir. I have a boyfriend.
How am I going to tell him this isn't a sanctuary city?
I’m not sure, but his face rings a bell.
In other respects they were a pretty advanced civilization.
Watching reality shows is a legitimate hobby.
I hope the advertisements for my new chiropractic office will attract those who need it most in the community.
No, I'm loving it. The neighbors are, like, so real, you know?
Please help. I was on my way to the restroom and got lost.
I'm house sitting for a friend.
" I've gotta hang up now. Some guy wants Kaopectate".
Fine, except do you remember that dating site I was telling you about?
This guy I'm seeing really rings my bell!
I think Harvey Weinstein is interested in me for the part.
Mom, my neighbor wants to know if you have any brass cleaner - I'm out.
...and officer... he keeps calling me Esmeralda...
Hi, I'm not online. My name is Quasimodo.
Can I call you back? I'm expecting another ring-in any minute.
That's the south side of 51st just off Fifth; and tell the Seals not to forget the DNA kit, a body bag and that they should clear air space so Marine One could get him out to Gowanus Canal as quickly as possible, that's very important
He said he's waiting for the president's motorcade.
Red Lover Oh Lover Watch Me Jump Over!
I tell you, the gargoyles get more realistic looking every year!
Our tastes in architecture are just too different
Privacy is a thing of the past.
I think he's thirsty.
Hello Mr Griffin
Did you get my text?
I said I'm dating a Fullback at Notre Dame and he said he offers more.
Yes, he's staring right at me. So, anyway, how do i change the ringtone again?
Hello, concierge? I found your missing bellhop.
Tell her I'm in a meeting
It's right under my flat, with a perfect "horror-movie-angle" view of the Hunchback...
The others lack realism and family values.
Well he's at least a little quasi-concerning.
Marilyn, what did we agree upon as being too short to date?
Oh wait, hold on, I think I see a possible candidate for 20/20
Me? Oh, not much. Just watering my neighbor Esmerelda's plants while she's out of town.
No, Margo, he doesn't at all look like he's about to sing.
and by the way there's a peeping tom in the building next to mine
Jim’s working on his gargoyle imitation.
Do you remember Quasimodo? We'll, you won't believe it, but he's moved into the building next to me.
I admire the squatters' tenacity, but condos are the future.
Hi, Tech Support. My ringtone isn't working.
My Ex has found religion, but he's got a hunch I'm better off without him.
Gotta go. This guy who calls himself Quasimodo keeps staring at me.
you know this is a better posture for it. Your intestines are at a 90 degree angle the other way.
With no toilet paper in sight, the leaves were his only option.
No, I won't go out on a date with you.
Odd, bumping into you again.
Sanctuary is in my bedroom.
Ha ha, you can't see my bum. They can see my bum but you can't see my bum. You will never see my bum! Ha ha.
I think someone named Esmeralda used to live here.
I can't believe we once walked on four legs.
He’s just staring at me.
Domain Squatting has taken a new turn.
Doctor, every hour I get a ringing in my ear?
Quasimodo's operandi for picking up women.
Hello Police. The Peeping Tom is back.
Still single, but I think the heir to the Squatty Potty fortune is on the verge of asking me out.
Bambi and his mother? How ironic.
It's a Quasi-ocean view apartment.
No, he's very talented, just not someone I want to live in a belfry with.
I think I finally spotted an affordable rental space.
Did you say to tell him to jump back?
Yes, I have a two year lease. But he's out here babbling about squatters rights!
I don't have a hunch why he's staring at me.
Enough with these Memes and I right?
I keep telling him to try yogilates.
This is Esmeralda again. I'd like to report that my stalker is hunched, back at Notre Dame.
THE CHURCH IS TRYING TO HAVE YOUR ATTENTION.
I think he's trying to get away from the priest...
No, nobody watched our place while we were away.
Oh my god, Becky it looks like Quasimodo is doing parkor again..
No, I have an iPhone. Moto is my neighbor.
It must be spring. I just saw my first Hunchback Voyeur.
Just a moment. I think Quasimodo is itching to talk with you.
Squats are definitely hard but lunges are killer.
Looks more like a Pseudomodo to me.
I gotta water my plants and my neighbor, then I'll be down.
Apple? This guy says you stole his ringtone.
Yeah, I think he's high.
I can recommend a great chiropractor.
I have a hunch he just moved in.
You don't understand - HE's growing, not my fern.
Yes, he's on the ball. But, this did not go well for Esmeralda.
411, how can I help?" "Hi yes, could you connect me to Esmeralda?
I guess I'd describe my new place as quasi-modern, for some reason.
Just guessing he plays Center on Notre Dame's football team.
Is your name Tom?
Honey: Our neighbor Joe has taken taken stalking to the next level!
I want to report a peeping Priest
Sorry, but I have to go...Quasimodo is dropping over for a drink.
Little Quasi is staring at me again. HEY ,,, HEY ... GO RING YOUR FUCKING BELL, YOU MORON!
He says he'll climb down if I play him that Fergie song.
You have no idea how hard it is to meet a deaf, one-eyed hunchback in New York City.
Mom, cancel my J-Date membership...
He comes every Wednesday. Is that a proper use of the word 'Ironic'?
Remember that guy I found in the shadow play--I cast out my fear and doubt, but I'm just not into him in that way.
Yes, I see you. My answer is still no!
He says there's a message tied to his leg.
The view from here gives me something to aspire to.
That bell ringer I've telling you about is about ready to ring his last bell.
Yes mom, the view from my apartment was worth the extra money.
Yes, he's still here.
Hello, officer? I'd like to report an incident of excessive bell ringing by my neighbor.
I know that's not politically correct, but calling him "the Kyphosic of Notre Dame" would just confuse people.
The guy from no. 2 is constipated again
Well he's certainly Djali looking
Don’t mind me I’m just the hired help
Ugh, my neighbor’s staring again
I'm calling to report a peeping Tom.
I think I know who's sitting on the winning lottery ticket.
I think I'm a doe. (It's actually the winning caption for the cartoon in the 10/9 print edition, but feel free to consider it for this cartoon, too.)
He claims he's trading off with King Kong.
Operator? I need the number for The Weinstein Company, please.
Water, water, I need water, please!
I want you to look me in the eye when we talk!
I tried to tell him that the real moral high ground is on the 85th floor at $10,000 a square foot.
I feel like we've drifted apart.
I'm not really sure. But something about him rings a bell. I don't know. He was here yesterday; I had a hunch he would be back.
Hi, it's Esmeralda. He's back.
Listen, I've gotta run. I invited my neighbor, Moe, over for coffee and sanctuary.
You could have just used the cell phone tower!
Come on over and ring my bell, Quasi.
Yes, hello 911? That creep from the Halloween Haunted House is flashing us again.
You know Mr.Follett it probably wouldn't hurt you to pick up a real estate section every now and then and see what's going on with some of the guys you went to school with.
No,don` call the police.It,s been a long time since a man tried to hop onto my ballcony.
You inspire me.
you can ring my bell anytime
Considering the view and the sphere-footage, I'm sure he's overpaying.
That peeping Quasimodo is back again
How did you get up there?
He looks like Marty Feldman and he's lost Esmeralda.
Esmeralda, please help me ring my bell
Fancy meeting you here.You must be Esmeralda!
Quasi-what? Doesn't ring a bell.
Nope, he still hasn't said a word. I don't care how many steps he climbs or how often he rings that bell, I'm not making the first move!
I think he's a stalker, but maybe it's just a hunch.
I think the neighbours look down on us.
Don't tell me you're on the phone with Captain Phoebus!
At length I thought it the best way to announce the winner.
He gave me water
He's a real hump, you know - no ringing, no jumping, no nothing.
Hi, it's Esmeralda, can you remind me how much water I should give to it?
Well what, then, exactly is Atlas supposed to look like?
I just learned that the priest loves Victor Hugo.
I have a hunch I'm going to regret offering him a back massage.
The economy really is creating new jobs, even for a guy I know with scoliosis.
Sorry, Tina - I keep trying to swipe left but this hunchback won't stop showing up on my feed!
He's doing it again. This is why we can never go to the movies.
I don't remember a second coming of Quasimodo from my Bible studies.
Hello, Minister? I think you have an escapee.
Over heeeere Juliet! Esmeralda is driving me nuts.
I have no idea who keeps stealing my bell peppers...
Yes, but 'sanctuary' does sound attractive.
Esmerelda, and we all move on, Quasimodo.
Altamira?
No, this is Midtown. You're looking for Morningside Heights...
He looks like some character from ‘Game of Thrones’, officer, and plant friendly.
I just got tired of all the filth on the street, you know?
Walter, that funny little man is watching me again.
CAW, CAW, CA-CAW!
'Great composition, but limited palette.'
Hello moto...sort of.
He just doesn't ring my bell.
He's, like, so cute. I'll text you a photo.
Gentrification is ruining my view.
Year 2027: "Sad, to think he use to be the f***ing president."
We have got to quit meeting like this!
I already showered. Come back tomorrow.
Mr. Hugo please...
He's'quasi' all right. But he'll have to ring the buzzer and not the bells.
Tom, aspiring to take his peeps to new heights.
The stalker is back
Better a peeping hunchback than Harvey Weinstein.
Oh Good, She Doesn't See me!
Slouching is bad for your posture
He says he just doesn't fit in anywhere.
I hope the hell he leaves pretty soon !
She's plain for a gargoyle, but I'd still like to meet her.
Oh, I know he's flirting but I'm just not dating now
That new guy just texted. Said he had a hunch I was his type.
you ever dated a guy by the name Quasimodo?
WOW - never thought their was reception up here!
I think he wants to be friends.
Not 'mojo'. Moto. Moto!
I guess this is what it means to live in a sanctuary city!
I'm learning how to fly!
Tell the chaplain I may need a jump start.
Regarding that restraining order, he's back.
I had a hunch you'd be here.
For the third time, Q-U-A-S-I-M-O-D-O
He's going to have to learn, to stand up for himself.
The condo association offers even non-Nazis the opportunity to join torch-carrying lynch mobs.
I’ll keep talking. Feel free to chime in.
Yes, I do, Father-- as a matter of fact, I'm having a tête-á-tête with him right now.
Hi Cindy. That weird guy is here again looking at my bluebells .
I am taking prayer to a higher level.
I've got a hunch that he's got a hunch.
The only bad thing is he's French.
Nothing to worry about. Just a guygoyle.
Not even the heavens can stall gentrification.
"I'm sorry honey, when your name's on the tower you can sit wherever you want".
Does your sanctuary program protect humpbacked perverts?
Preoccupied strangers
I have a hunch it is a large bat
I can't help him now, Stanley. already multitasking.
True, he's not stalking me on Facebook.
Who needs Tinder when you've got the boy next door...
I had a hunch back then you would predict this.
He's Quasi cute...
He must have read my biography in the "Book of Ruth". He's following me everywhere. All he ever says to me is, "Where you go, I will go."
No, I didn’t say I have a hunch…
Maybe now she'll notice me!
Well yeah...Vic claims he's at the pinnacle of success in his tech start-up, but I just can't help seeing it's a quasi mode of confidence-- and that he's really staring oblivion in the face.
It's either Quasimodo or a frog and I won't kiss him or it!
Well, i jus t dint know...
Quasi is pointed south by southeast.
Centuries of the sanctuary of urban life
I'm not much on rear window ethics.
My French neighbor is such a weirdo...
No, I said a peeping Quasimodo.
No one notices me in this city, not a single soul.
He wants me to come over and ring his bell. He says he's famous and his name is Harvey. What can go wrong?
when the bell rings
I'm telling you he thinks it's a squatty potty!
I'm meeting new people since I've moved in, mom. The caretaker at the church next door is giving me a lot attention but he's only quasi-interesting.
Hold on a minute Mom, I need to run Quasimodo off again
...yeahhh, he's like totally still there... he says its a peaceful sit in, but, like, I think he's just, like, a perv.
I've got a hunch I'm overwatering this succulent.
Do you really think that this bean stalk can grow so fast that he can get back in time for dinner?
Hang on, my ex is hunching around outside again
so...what are some of the more extreme symptoms for addiction to angry birds?
Let this be a lesson, son. Never hold a Stag Party at an Art Gallery.
Lady, if they ring the Church Bell, please catch me.....
I am calling to report a peeping gargoyle.
doMy life is just like a "spinning top" no body knows where it may go. I just follow the "flow" ( do you know) ??
I have a hunch that I should have swiped left.
I have to ring off, Mom; I think my neighbor wants to borrow my mortar and pestle again.
Now THIS sucks.
Is that bottled or spigot water?
I have to let you go, my husbands almost home
He keeps calling me 'Esmeralda.'
I have a hunch that this isn’t going to have a happy ending.
I've got a hunch my neighbor's been spying on me.
Just as soon as I finish watering my plant.
He asks me to watch him relieving himself and promises the eternity.
These lights are very distracting.
Why yes, I would say that he is taking his precarious predilection to new heights.
Esmeralda. You used to be so topsy-turvy.
Yes, "stoney limits cannot hold love out."
I think he keeps saying bluebells! Bluebells! But it's a Dracaena.
Lon Chaney just moved in next door. I think he likes my floral arrangement.
HE LOOKS SO REAL..QUASI-HUMAN,THEY SAY..
911? I've got another window peeper on Church Point 27.
A week ago my plant was, like, dying!
You won’t believe what some people will do to watch me water my balcony plant.
Larry is trying to peak at my treats again.
Yeah, some French guy found out I'm an American and is worried I'm going to shoot him.
I see this guy's work everywhere.
He's become very popular. I see his work everywhere.
I’ve always enjoyed his early Bambi period.
...just a hunch
Deerivative...
You know what, I will swipe right. Sometimes it's fun to live on the edge.
Yes he does look like Charles Laughton’s great grandson. How did you know?
Victor Hugo, no I never heard of him.
It's a sign. That's what I'm telling you.
Uh huh, right. Yup- hold on. Hey Quasimodo, you need something? Water?
Nothing much. Oh, yeah, there's this guy who insists on calling me Esmeralda.
He says he is a Bruce-goyle.
Hold on a second, someone else is ringing.
He does chime on the hour.
Esmeralda? Beats me!
I've got a hunch you're really going to like my new apartment.
Quasi is my name, ringing bells is my game.
Mom, I feel like I'm missing something...
I think he thinks my name is "sanctuary"
No, I'm not a football fan and yes, 'The Halfback of Notre Dame' is perched outside my window!
A peaking Tom, in deed.
Sorry, what? My neighbor is at his music again!
It has a quasi-nice view though.
Can you hear me now?
He's a hunchback on top of a church. What more do you need?
Keeping up with the Kardeershians
The balls! The balls!
I am hoping he meant to say to look for the key under the pot.
I have a hunch about my potted plant.
Mine is a co op.
He's not kneeling or standing - he's just squatting.
Hold on, I'm having a deja vu."
He's kind of cute, but he does have his own place --Notre Dame.
I have a quasi-view from my balcony.
Here, I can let you talk to him right now.
All I said was 'Esmerelda from the University of Notre Dame' and now he won't leave me alone.
Ring-a-ding-ding!
If he starts ringing the bell I'll call you back
I had a hunch I'd find you here.
Venison de Milo and little Stew...magnificent
I swear he's a dead ringer for Charles Laughton.
Chill out. Phone's almost charged.
Ma, look I gotta go. That tower bell guy is leering at me again.
So far it's 1-0, and I'm leading this staring contest.
Gotta go - I think my blind date for Easter Sunday just showed up.
He says he took a second job.
It's been a few days , huh?
You PROBABLY shouldn't be intimidated - but as I was saying before you HUNG UP on me, "I'm calling on behalf of the Police Benovent Fund . . ."
Next time, text me.
Es here, sweetie, just spitballing but I see Quasimodo and a potted plant as a winning ticket in 2020.
Yeah, he does ring a bell, actually.
These phone bills sure aren't going down. And these government vultures sure are invasive, Ivy.
Quasimodon't look at me like that
No, it's the hunchback of St. Patrick's in New York.
Look, I'm not a religious person, but I think a miracle is about to happen.
Hello 9-1-1, I have a description of that peeping tom. A weird looking face, hunchback, and a Notre Dame fan.
Guess what Harvey’s up to now.
I don't know, I think he's yelling something about the quarterback at Notre Dame.
Creepy neighbors keep locksmiths in business... right Quasimodo?
I have a hunch my neighbor likes me.
Can we do hunch—I mean brunch.
Your face rings a bell.
Yeah, he's right there, just staring at me. But least he isn't ringing that damn bell at all hours!
Mouse!
His name may be Quasi, but he's totally creepy.
See the way she is watering her plant...she wants me.
He’s old fashioned. No texts, but he’s trying to learn voicemail.
It's called reverse AirBnB.
Finally, we meet, one crone to another.
Sure he's unsettling, but his parkour is amazing.
Cardinal Dolan, he's back.
That's a Ficus, it prefers regular misting!
I want to report a high-jumper, who happens to be something of an exhibishinist.
I’d take a selfie with him, but it’s probably what he wants.
Cream or sugar?
He dumped me last week but I have a hunch he'll be back.
Pics or it never happened.
It all started when his cell phone died.
Put me th
I guess he's trying to tell me his place is rent controlled.
He only comes up on Wednesdays.
"If you're busy, I can ring you later."spevakpoet@
Oh, oh, send me TWO chocolate croissants, please.
Esmeralda, what’s growing between us?
I have apretty strong hunch he likes me!
I swear my plant is thriving! I think Quasi sings to it while I'm away.
Want:-to-be actors will do anything to get that part in the remake of Hunchbak..
Security? I'd like to report a quasi-stalker.
He could be the hunchback of Notre-Dame for all I care. I just want to feel protected.
IF YOU WOULD HAVE SIGNED UP YOU COULD HAVE HAD THAT PROBLEM REMOVED .
Who told you there was a stick up my butt?
Not much. What's new with you?
I think he’s a football player. From Notre Dame?
Be careful you don't knock that thing over.
It's a no-bedroom loft. It comes with "sanctuary", and the best part is we would be neighbors!! He's asking $100K but I think you could talk him down.
I gotta run, the hunchback is here.
Le Voyeur de Notre Damr
Only when I water.
I told him I pitched for Notre Dame, so now he wants to see my rise ball.
I can smell that pot plant from here.
This is my second goth sighting this week.
I had a hunch you would be here today. You too?
Sally, he really takes charades seriously.
Looks like he's about to leap from church to private sector. Must be one of those lobbyists trying to do away with birth control.
He says he belongs to the local Neighborhood Watch.
I call it "mooning" because the Hebrew words for moon and buttocks are almost homonyms. = = = = = = = = = See slide 11 in https://www.dropbox.com/s/am5qcg97ef4h77n/Idioms_via_PSM.pptx?dl=0
If I jump on your balcony we you let me inside so we can massage each other.
That new club Sanctuary is great. The bouncer, though...
Yes, Quasimodo, we do wear pants AND water plants.
I don't know why I have to pay for his sunshine, I'm on the shady side of the building.
So this dweeb with all his underwear on his back is looking at me, but I don't think he can jump this far.
Trust me. If you're afraid of heights, this apartment definitely is not for you.
I have a hunch, he is either a prayer or a pryer.
Oh yes, Dan's new job is a perfect fit for him, and the commute - right across the street - has been great for our relationship.
The human gargoyle is back
It may be politically incorrect, but you should see this.
Oh my god - can I call you back - my neighbor, Quasimodo - yeah, that guy - right, the guy who's like, You're Not Going To Sleep In On Sunday Mornings Ever Again! - is peeping.
IU've told him a hundred times, I'm not interested.
I think Medical Marijuana will help him.
Have ever thought that Harvey Weinstein and Quasimodo are twins?
If that wan't bad enough, we now have hunchbacks.
excuse me your blocking my lighting for my selfie
No, no! I have a hunch PERIOD. I am being watched
I'm serving my penance, but for Christ sake please call the fire department on that Iphone glued to your ear.
Lennie's just rehearsing for "The Hunchback of Notre Dame."
Tom, your peeking is a bit extreme.
You know the hideous gargoyle on the building across the street? Harvey Weinstein is squatting on the bell tower above it.
My doctor told me to reach for the stars
I think we have a jhumper at Notre Dame.
He says his name is Quasimodo.
I was looking for a modern feel, but he was hoping for a more old world charm.
He wants to know if his religion is a deal breaker for you.
I love my new apartment, it's very bourgeois!
I can't decide if he's a beautiful flower in an ugly vase or a creeper with a big pot.
Yes, he's still there. I hear he taught at The New School.
My chakras have just been so misaligned lately, you know?
Oops ... Pardon me ... I climbed the wrong bell tower.
Yeah, I know...I just go with it now.
But I have no maintenance fees!
Little help here, madam?
My neighbor? He's one of those 12th century dudes.
'That don't impress me much, and I still say no."
You are going to love my new place, I have a hunch.
Yeah, so I got the lead role in the movie... but there's a catch.
Who wore it better: Quasimodo or Simeon Stylites?
He's so funny. He keeps saying "waawaa" instead of water.
Other than Quasimodo at eye level, nothhing much is new.
Thank you. That's enough dressing on my salad.
Go back downstairs, Tom, or I'm calling 911.
It's quasi modern
Hey, lady? You got any toilet paper?
I'm still not going to marry you even if you climb the the highest mountain.
I've decided to decorate the apartment in a quasimodern style.
What? Did you say it might be a guy named Casey Motor?
It's Apu from The Golden House and he wants in. Maybe Rushdie's gone beyond his literary license.
Hello, Charles Laughton Fan Club? I have news.
I think he said he can't find the clapper.
Forever condemned to this high love
What've ya gotta loose, girl? He's got a great location, but might be a tad sensitive about his background.
I knew I should have looked into those air rights.
Oh, really? I sleep right through it!
I know I haven't called since our break-up, but someone just made me think of you.
Fern whom the bell tolls.
Oh y’know, my usual Saturday stuff....after The Hunchback is done watching me water the pathos maybe I’ll go check out the farmer’s market.
Quasimodo? No, I think he's just an imposture.
Well, it appears that Quasimodo escaped from the bell tower at Notre Dame.
I can’t believe Sandra would do that.
My neighbor has got the hump again!
Bowling got boring.
Hi, 911, either a gargoyle's squatting on the spire opposite my balcony or it’s the aquaphobic downstairs neighbor.
It's Peeping Tom Sunday at the church.
Yes, the author' name begins with H, but the book is not For Whom the Bell Tolls!
This Hunchback wanna be is now a peeping tom!
Hello, I'd like to report a peeping tom.
It's suppose to repel gargoyles or your money back!
He's always reminding me that it's a sanctuary up here.
He’s got “bats in the belfry.”
He doesn't look exactly like his profile photo, but he is a musician.
Ive got a hunch I'm being stared at
I have a hunch that you come out here because you like me.
Honey, That Hunchback is here again!
They say his name is Harvey...
Dr. Roberts, one of your chiropractic patients got confused and is up here again.
He’s about to desecrate the liberty bell.
I'll have to call you back. My Father's here for confession.
Hello hunchback.
I think that in a perverse way that what he's doing is gallant.
So that's how he got his hunched back.
If only she'd swipe right...
I didn't say Simon says.
Judy, there's a peeping Quasimodo staring at me
I'm training Tom to look into my eyes instead of DOWN my blouse.
Hey there, I am your new neighbor from San Francisco nano-apartment
Hold on, I think the neighbor just rang the bell.
I think he was, like, drawn to my new ringtone. It's, like, marimbas or something.
Aspire to the top: high floor, garden view, peak property.
For the disco hour, I have someone dying to hear "Ring My Bell"
My back's not getting any straighter, you know?
The zoning laws in this neighborhood have to change
I guess that's what happens when you feed a genetically modified organism a genetically modified organism.
I am looking at him right now - we are on top of the world and he really is on the ball!
He's just the Gargoyle. Not Mr. Gargoyle, not Bro-goyle, not The Goyle-meister, not Gargoyl-ius, not Gargoy-licious. Ok, sometimes he's Mr. Crouchy....
Is that Esmerelda?
La Notre Dame aux Camelias?
He keeps calling me 'Esmeralda.'
Well, at least they kicked him out of the Academy.
Officer, I'd like to report a thirsty hunchback.
It's kind of a quasi-modern neighborhood.
Forget the osteopath; get me the proctologist.
I clearly need to significantly reduce my fiber intake!
Buyers may lack your aesthetic sensitivity. Let me do some staging.
It's the best way to improve your posture. You have to try it.
Suppose this is what I get for being name Esmerelda -- and moving across the street from the Cathedral.
Sure, I'm OK. Quasi is looking after me."
Yea, this new Quasimotorola has a hunchback guarantee.
Got any liquid courage in the old cabinet, missus?
I have a hunch he's up to something.
The ringtone! The ringtone!
"Pull my chain and ring my bell".
?"I mean he doesn't look anything like his eHarmony profile pic."?
He says he'll throw in the alarm system.
Hold on Sally, the stalker's back.
That Trump Era bald eagle is looking for a hair piece again.
Oh, and that hunch is back.
He's kind of growing on me.
A leap of faith.
On the plus side, he manages a successful limo service called Quasi-Motors.
I sense a Gothic Revival is just ahead. I sense a Gothic Revival is just ahead.
You won't believe what I'm looking at!
No, I have never seen him ring the bells.
We’d make a perfect couple-you’re sanity would counterbalance my inanity
Oh, it's just the Hunchback of Battery Park.
One step away from paradise.
He's kinda cute, but he keeps calling me Esmeralda.
Frollo? Yeah, it's me ... I have a hunch that the weirdo is back.
Darling conservationists just don't understand real estate development, it gets rid of the riff-raff
Don't lecture me again about gentrification.
Once you go hunch you got back.
The simplicity is so amazing and the images remind me of home and family.
Tea, thee, and me?
Not sure sweetie, he doesn't appear to be a true modo, more of a quasi-modo.
It’s hard to describe but I just seem to have this feeling ...
I have a hunch on where to find sanctuary.
Quasiloco.
Ahhhhh. Too much water. Back off. Just a hunch.
He's getting bolder.
Well, now I know why the old tenant suggested I set my ringtone as "the bells".
I think I know where he went when he left the Colts game
I gotta go...45 is peeping at me again.
I have a hunch you're Quasimodo.
I'd like to ring her bell.
I do like the apartment, but the hunchback is kind of creepy.
We started out selling cheese steaks.
We were way ahead of the curves, weren't we?
TOTALLY PERFECT BODY.
Hey, I don't like you that, can we be friends?
I'm willing to continue the relationship from a distance. I just hope he has guts enough to take the plunge!
I absolutely love my new apartment. It has a fantastic view of Notre-Dame.
It's just a hunch, but I think he's thirsty.
It's so humbling to realize they thought of us as gods.
Hop right over if you are thirsty.
Sorry, but its the only place I could get away from Hillary Clinton's excuse making after her loss to Donald Trump.
No, Notre Dame plays Navy this week
I need a new outfit for the Festival of Fools.
Careful. You look like squab.
It's quasi private here.
The 1800's are calling, they want their belfry back.
Your hunch's back.
If you had let down your hair.
yes, it grows very well, the bath every day
It's okay, his wife doesn't allow him to watch the TV.
He can probably claim squatters’ rights...
So, just tell him "Back in the belfry?"
Yes, I told the bishop that I was not interested!
Buy the air rights.
Ez, he keeps asking," Why can I not be made of phones like thee?"
Harry thinks he's a gargoyle.
Gotta run. Harvey Weinstein wants me to give him a shower.
She said what ! . . they do so know, . . . oh yeah, says his name is Quazi something . . . lunch tomorrow?
No, I'm guessing he lives there, but I paid no attention to him until after the hurricane. I tried throwing him a roll of toilet paper yesterday.
The Climb definitely wasn't worth it!
He's the most dedicated Peeping Tom I've ever seen.
You says his name is . . . Quasimodo ?
I have to go. My new boyfriend’s here to pick me up.
He could be my Father!
The new Hugo Boss ad campaign is over the top if you ask me.
You won't believe the new fineal they put on the Cathedral !
I'm thirsty
Hang on—just got to move this plant over for a fellow playing leap frog.
I don't know his name, what is this Jeopardy? It's the guy that played Captain Bligh, but he's without his uniform and he's staring at me.
You should check out the new balancing act by my apartment.
Well he can ring my bell any time he wants.
He grows on you.
This gentrification is getting out of control.
I was thinking about spending more time at church.
There's this really weird pigeon that won't stop looking at me.
Now for the plyometric jump I learned last week in class.
I think it's time to change my ringtone.
Well, I have a Hunch that might go down the wrong way !
No, he's not listed in the lease.
I think he's a Comic con guy getting carried away.
No, I didn’t say it was quasi-modern.
Hold on a second. I've got to get away from the hunchback voyeur of New York City.
Hi, I'm Harvey. For a quick massage, I could make you into a movie star.
Elizabeth, your ex is wearing his Quasimodo outfit again and looking scary.
I have cell service but the hunchback is still trying.
I'm looking for someone who can sweep me off my feet.
Hey I am going to have to call you back. That weirdo from next door is staring at me again!
Do you think I'm close enough for Him to hear me?
He's more like quasi-stalker.
A leap of faith.
He's cute. He's just always getting high and clingy.
He says if I massage his back l'll He says if I massage his back he'll make me a real bell ringer.
Is like to report a peeping Quasimodo please.
Can you smell me now?
Are you God?
Oui, mon amour, this new apartment really is a sanctuary for my thirsty plants.
I just have a hunch that Notre Dame football will be back this year.
Last week I thought he was cured, but now I take my hunch back.
No, Quasimodo is not some kinda cross between haute couture and shabby chic.
Yes, Mr. Hugo, Quasimodo still seems obsessed with me, and this time half-naked!
Mom...I think I'm falling in love.
Victor.....Desdemona here and have I got a novel idea for you!
Quasimodo is taking this stalking thing to a whole new level!
Deer #1: I was walking by these signs and I seen deer on 4 legs. What does it mean? Deer #2: Im not sure, maybe they have deer prancing in the area.
Not "Monty." I'm practicing for the Full-Modo.
Hello, is this the dating service? My name is Esmeralda and I have a complaint.
They just make such a mess on the roof tiles.
I need to report a Peeping Tom who has gone up in the world!
I'm telling you, I think Quasi is actually going to Parkour this time.
About 5' 10", maybe 180 lbs. - never mind, he could be a dead ringer for my brother.
I loved moving to Paris and looking at all of its Gothic architecture but there's this guy outside my balcony yelling "Esmeralda, Esmeralda"
Sir, you don't know how comforting it is to have someone to talk to.
I don't know what he wants, but he sure isn't getting any water from me.
You should go to church sometime.
Esmeralda, I will always want your water.
9-11. He looks like Laughton but without makeup.
...to be by Esmerelda's ear! Oh iPhone, why was I not made of anodized aluminum like thee!
Do you ever feel like you're living in a movie?
I have a hunch that he'll be back before you know it
Parkour!
No, I didn't say I could see a humpback from my balcony...I said hunchback.
He sounds so exotic. His name is Igor. He could be from Russia!
He's pulling some strings to get us off-street parking.
Peter Kuper's cartoon has gone missing, pictures of several "Deer Crossing" warnings hung as art, one of a doe and fawn. Two standing bucks size that one up. One says. "Four is fair for them."
He's not great looking, but he rings a mean bell.
Yeah, but at least I no longer have to listen to deafening bells, every fifteen minutes.
Don't you think your plant might prefer a SOUTHERN exposure?
It fells as if I can see the future
Yes, and I don't like birds or stalkers.
The guy outside my deck has a delusion of "Bell Tower Power" .
No honey, I think it’s just another one of those ninja warriors
Yes, this is Esmeralda. Who's calling please?
Call someone to get me down.
Yes Frollo, he's up here again
Yes, this is Esmeralda. Why do you ask?
Actually, I find these exhibits of bathroom door art to be pretty limited.
"911? There's a man outside looking threateningly at my potted pothos.
Get us off the Île de la Cité, NOW!
um, honey there is a strange man watching me water the plants.
Ew! That Quasi-mofo is stalking me again.
Need any help?
I'm calling to report a peeping Tom.
would you like to go out to dinner?
Didja ever feel you could just reach out and touch Quasimodo?
Hi, I think there's a gargoyle on the loose.
Yeah, another member of the book club reading Hunchback of Notre Dame..
Hold on, it looks like I've got a message from Harry Potter.
Front Desk? This is Room 804. I asked for a room with a view, a viewer!
I guess I just wasn't expecting the Hunchback view to be so, you know, disconcerting.
Taken... By the Pope! Andy Serkis Edition.
He’s baaaaaaaack!
Hello, officer. His name is Jose and yes he can see.
It is truly the only way to get a bird's eye view of the city.
Hunchback's just looking for a callback
My yoga instructor likes to get medieval.
Mother - my husband is making sure I water his plant again
No officer it's not a peeping Tom, its a peeping Quasimodo.
I think he though cathedral buttress was "butt terrace".
I've got this hunch.
Yeah, I think they put a new gargoyle on the church across the street.
We broke up but we will always have Notre Dame.
“But, he just keeps staring and singing in quasi-tones”.
If I ignore him, do you think he'll go away?
Victor Hugo always did creep me out!
It happened again! I swear the gargoyle just called my plant Esmeralda!
He must be seeking sanctuary outside of Hollywood
Bill?, our balcony is a bit too close to Notre Dame
I'm Butt-man! I came here all the way from Europe to help the poor guys: after a short glance at me - girls run straight to their spouses and don't leave them again.
I envy his squat game, but he's still creepy.
Honestly, Rachel, I preferred the movie version.
Oh, God, I have to hang up. You know that weird little dude I told you about in that church next door, well I think he's actually gunna jump this time. Oh fuck me. I'm going inside. I'll call you back.
Only if it's a cat?
"It looks like he's been left high and dry".
EXCUSE ME, IS THIS THE ROUTE TO HEAVEN?
On game day Saturdays, he tolls the Notre Dame fight song then peeps...
How are the Fighting Irish doing today?
We broke up a week ago so now I'm just trying to give him the space he needs to pine away for me until he turns to dust.
Hold on. I'm on the balcony. The Hunchback of Flatbush is giving me a weird look from his spire.
No, I feel like he’s just going to stay there until he dies...
Get Quasimodo off the Spire and explain to him that this is not a sanctuary Condo.
If watching is all you're going to do...
I think I need a taller chapel.
I will tolerate anything for south-facing views.
The rent is high but the view is only quasi-luxurious
he says I'll never work in this town again
Hello, this is Esmeralda. May I speak to the Archdeacon?
Hey, it's Esmy. So, I'm seeing this new guy who really rings my chimes.
Oh my God, I love their bread sticks!
I was afraid something like this would happen when the Church finally cracked down on priest child abuse.
Donna... He's baaack!
I'm busy now, but why don't you swing by later.
I'm pouring a bunch of my piss on a plant.
Sorry, smoking not allowed there.
Looks like Apartment 1 are growing genetically modified plants again.
Jack is sitting across from me, waiting for his beanstalk to grow. My flying carpet should be here in a minute.
I'm sorry, Master. I will never disobey you again.
Yes, I would like to report a peeping Quasimodo.
I was trying to get closer to God, but apparently there's an easier way.
If you are that interested in my plant, I'll just give it to you...
Yeah, I know what your thinking, but he says he's Batman.
Pole sitter, "Sitting on a ball is not the way to my heart Alvin."
Quasi-modern is the newest trend.
I had a hunch ur gonna call
Gee, from the ground, it DID look lieit was mylar...
He is complaining that my Bells of Ireland Flowers are too loud and make his ears ring.
I'm glad I bought the condo, downtown rental vacancies are really low!
I feel like you've been up there for centuries.
Yes, that's right. He decided to use one of his sick days.
Hello...yes, this is Ismeralda....
"...and now he's telling me that love is like a tree, grows by itself. I agree it seems sweet, I'm just saying it seems like a lot of effort".
Esmeralda! Long time no see.
I'd like to report a broken elevator.
The Blue Bells, The Blue Bells...
Romeo, my Romeo, why must thou be a pooper?
Looks like my Uber is going to be late.
Hopefully he can’t jump because of his hump!
First I'd like to get whatever serves as his autograph---then a restraining order.
He does ring a bell
..and at the end, the beast magically turns into a handsome prince. Movies are so far-fetched!
He appears to need a bathroom.
Hold on, I've got a hunch...
Get a beagle? I thought you said... get a smeagle
Why didn't you bring your phone with you?
I have a hunch it won't work.
Should I tell him to walk this way?
Really, I promise this one's not gay.
Hi, honey. I think we need to go to that church down the street. Just a thought!
Just when does falling water stimulate flow?
As you told me, he can climb higher than the bell tower.
Yes, he's still here. He used to be in for "Sleep No More" and is now unemployed.
Hi Mom--I've told you before that Quasi is "really on the ball"!
That reminds, it's Wednesday, time to water my plants.
The guy from match.com just won't take no for an answer.
Quasi...really, get with the times...
Yeah, he's still here, even though I told him I won't play Esmeralda to his Hunchback!
esmeralda blues...
For all one knows, at this pitch, I may ring a bell.
May I have some privacy please... This is my first time on AirP&P.
So, do you have a goat?
He's supposed to come down on a barge.
1833 would like Quasimodo back. Can you send a ladder and bucket?
I gotta go. Hunch needs me again.
You're not going to believe this. Religion is dead, but that dear hunchback is the last holdout, clinging to the church tower.
There goes your son again. Did you make sure he applied sunscreen this time?
Guess I can't look down on him anymore
Yes, I met Quasimodo.
Now he's moved in right across the street.
Oh, I wouldn't say there's a motive -- well, maybe a quasi motive.
Good to see Philly remains Penn's "greene country towne".
There’s a guy here, says his name is Quasimodo and that, I look like his gypsy!
He's always ringing that bell and inviting me over for drinks.
"I thought this would help you pee".
Can you hold? My ringer says I have another call.
We'll take Notre Dame with the points.
Good morning. Have a good day.
Had a hunch you'd like my new apartment
I said he looked like Quasimodo; now he's insisting I'm his Esmeralda. So Weinstein!
No, no that's the Phantom. This is the really ugly one.
It’s just my ex-boyfriend making out he naturally inhabits the tops of bell towers.
Hello police department. This is Esmeralda again.
I'm just not sure how he feels.
We've come a long way since we defeated the apes who defeated the humans.
I love his use of color but would have preferred Hunters orange .
Phone the Bishop? But it is the Bishop.
Don't over water it.
Your Bernie is playing a hunch again.
I think Harvey Weinstein's been cleaning my windows again.
I don't know... Says his name is Quasimodo. He'd work for the Halloween party, but then I'd have to get right back on Tinder. So I asked myself, Is it worth it?
You can take your hunch back, I'm NOT going to church today!
How do I know it's not a latex gargoyle?
At least it’s better than listening to the damn bell ringing day and night.
What's the difference between calling the President a Dotard and a Moron? 1. Free Speech, 2. Citizenship, 3. Honesty, 4. All of the above, 5. None of the above, or 6. Country of Origin
Bell or no bell, get me down from here!
I knew her when she was just one of the herd
Would you be so kind as to toss over the gyro- with- double feta order that should be arriving at your door?
It's almost as if he KNOWS I'll need sanctuary at some point.
911, this is Esmeralda from the Parc Notre Dame Condos. That Quasimodo creep is  stalking me again. Can you send a patrol car right away?
I've tried that, Sheryl. He knows my binge schedule for Game of Thrones.
Hang on , Quasimodo can't find the garderobe!
Esmerelda, Esmerelda, it's me, Quasimodo. Esmerelda put down the damn phone for Christ's sake!
Quasi's into parkour these days....
'I'm jumping because housing prices are unreasonable in Sydney' - George Pell
Is it yoga or pilates for back issues?
You haven't met him, mom, but his face may ring a bell.
He says he's coming over tonight, but I don't know if he's going to make it.
Quasimodo's back, but I'm trying to ignore him
They served beans for lunch after church today
He's a Domer, but not like the ones we dated in college.
Appar
Me? You know, Just a girl...and her hunchback...I know right?
" hello ?.....Statue Quasimodo ?
It looks to be more a like a quasi-sculpturre."
Well, at least he's not ringing that dam bell.
This is Mrs. Shelly Berman. My husband's on the other phone talking to a store about a man hanging from their window, but I'm calling about a hunchback on your spire...
This perv across the street keeps asking for somebody named Esmeralda.
Finally Your Here what took you so long
I'd like to report a "Not-So-Peeping" Tom
Hi, it's your neighbor. Did someone forget Quasimodo again?
...and he keeps yelling “sanctuary!”
I did not mean for the H to be silent when you thought I said " a man is SITTING on top of the bell tower next door"
Gargoyle Watching
He keeps trying to ring my chimes!
I have a quasi-secret admirer.
I can't see it
Gotta go, Marge, my date is here to take me cathedral climbing again.
911, I'd like to report a stalker.
Seems harmless. Says he is the grandson of Quasimodo looking for South Bend.
So, should I like, swipe left, or jump with him?
I suggested he try pilates
Yep, I'm a material girl.
'Bye, Siri. Hello, 'Modo!
May I come over for years?
I can't find a balance man.
And I came up here for more privacy
Yes, that‘s his new daily routine!
Another Madona con bambino, I'm getting sick and trend of these Italian museums
I have a hunch I'm being watched.
He's not quasi anything. He's fully hunched on the church steeple
You rememb.er I told you about the guy next door who keeps bothering me for some water? I think I'll go ahead and give it to him
I heard a ring...did you call?
Wow, our ancestors sure did look a lot like us!
And the bell on that Quasimodo chime you sent just doesn’t work!
OMG, the Climbing Shaun is back.
*Mouths* "Your phone."
Well it's not just that he's staring at me - it's also a hunch.
Why doesn't she talk to us small guys?
yes Mom, he's still there. yes, he has a huge hunchback, and great balance. and no, i am not interested in dating right now, why..?
I love you.
I can't talk now, there's a bell ringer stalking me.
He must have a friend in the building named Sanctuary and he's totally creeping me out.
What kind of bird is that?
I can see a woman watering her plants from here .
These greens are rich in vitamins and bone-building Vitamin D. Quasi, are you listening ?
Hold on, I think Harvey Weinstein is trying to get my attention
iAGO. Must be some new startup.
Our property manager is really on the ball!
Where are my glasses when I need them
Never mind, it's not another solar eclipse.
He just stares at me. I have a hunch he'll be back.
The bell ringer is defecating atop the bell tower. Do you think he is commenting on today's sermon?
In your dreams Harry.
I'll have to call you back. Quasimodo's gone rogue.
Nice Tits
Be patient, we'll be eating kale in no time.
Before cell phones, you would have needed me.
Did you get a chance to follow up on my hunch?
Uh, a little help?
I always knew we could get together!
I believe, he thinks he's a frog. I wish he'd just hop away.
I've been rehearsing Quasimodo's lines with him for the movie remake.
Oh no she didn’t
He says he's looking for the Notre Dame.
I dialed the number. Can you hear it ringing?
No, he is not good looking.
Yeah, I love how much, like, old school CULTURE there is here, but I still have to drive like 20 minutes to get some decent sushi...
Yes, he's been up here for hours, complaining that his view of the graveyard has been obstructed by our new condo building. Something about "greenspace"!
"He's on the thrown right now, can he call you back"?
Funny, he doesn't look gargoylsh.
Shall we take the plunge?
So he tells me, 'you either unclog the toilet or it stays clogged.' I just walked away. I'm tired of doing everything for him.
Your watering schedule is very unfortunate.
Yes, I'm dressed, and, yes, it's growing.
Hey Esmeralda, any chance of a sip of that?
Now Harvey's sizing ME up.
I have to go. My boyfriend's ringing me.
I've got a hunch that he thinks we're related.
I think he belongs back with the bats.
It's your mother. She says you need to drink more water.
Well, at least it's Aunt Jane's best side.
I'll pick you up in the hunchback...I mean hatchback.
Quasimodo just invented a new yoga pose: Take a dump on a church steeple pose.
Hey one moment, there is a man on the cathedral outside.
It lacks a human element.
His hair isn't growing.
Darling, can you be a darling and bring more water?
911? American ninja warrior keeps on stalking me.
I mean, he's not homeless and he's quasi employed.
Esmeralda as an anthophile.
Yeah...., mine abandoned me. For a plant, it really lacked a true appreciation for the outdoors.
No, I don't think he'll actually jump off.
I know mom! I already told him to humpback down.
Oui, my new place is over by Notre Dame. Yes, yes, THAT Notre Dame.
I'm highly attracted to you.
Je te l'ai dit, Manon, il y aurait des problèmes dans un bâtiment surplombant la Seine
I really thought it would stop when I moved into the apartment upstairs
I just told him I was feeling a friend vibe.
Nothing much, just watering the plants and watching the Gargoyle
Please save some water for me.
Yeah mom, it has a great view, but there's just one problem... here's only one problem...
Kindly silence your phone.
Uh, Matt’s in your belfry again
...yes, I believe the Greenhouse Effect is caused mainly by human activities!
The Blue Bells, The Blue Bells...
I don't know because he is quasi-deaf from ringing that bell.
The stylized iconography would have made Bambi proud.
hey look what i can do!
Apparently this is still a sanctuary city.
Not hearing bells.
He gave me water
Um, there's a real live gargoyle looking at me.
I told you I was higher than any plant.
Prince Kong? Yes, I see him.
I know, but the listing for his place mentioned a garden view.
Let me call you back. There's someone creepin' in.
Daniel Day-Lewis is back and preparing to play Quasimodo...? You don't say...
My mother said that's how Edmund Hillary got his start.
I don't know what I'm doing wrong, even the spire is blooming.
Yeah Mom, it's in this new neighborhood called NoHunch.
Not much, just watering my quasi-garden.
... and he doesn't have any pants on.
It's weird. He looks like a troll, but he's definitely not sitting in a cave.
You can ring my bell anytime "You can ring my bell anytime, cheri.
Hello, police department. I think I have a peeking Tomimodo.
Well, well a futuristic gold digger.
I never go out anymore... I'm as bad as the Hunchback of Notre Dame.
Quasimodo Syndrome, huh... how long does it last?
Don't overwater your pothos.
I'm glad we bought here but there is, like, no culture here.
I'd ask him to come to the phone, Emile, but he's hunching right now.
Would you like me to ring your bell?
Hey Mother, it's Mary. The silver bell and cockle shells are coming in just fine, but the pretty made is a Dame of a different sort.
I know he’s not great looking, Mom, but at least he’s really into me.
Any idea how much water Quasimodo Witch Hazel needs?
Should I throw him a bone?
'Quasi'No he didn't!'
I'm inspired to become a Catholic since moving to Paris
He says he just wants some water but that didn't end well for Esmeralda.....
911 - Help a hunchback is putting a HEX on my plants
911? There's a funny-looking fellow doing a King Kong on top of the cathedral outside my apartment. If you give me a number, I'll send a photo.
If you'd like to fertilize something you should aim this way.
Esmeralda, the church can offer you sanctuary. Just call me. Please, call me.
Sorry, can't hear you. The bell started ringing and there's a stalker on top of the cathedral again.
They call this one Broadway, Baby Boogie!
I'm innocent. Where am I going to get help?
I used to be a hood ornament.
'one minute I'M the maniac, next I'm a queen, he is driving me NUTS"
I love this borough; I'm greeted by Queensimodo every morn!
Step out on the balcony. I found your BASE jumping date.
Love at first peep.
Not a Quasi-Modo. A Complete Modo.
Can I plant myself on your terrace?
My balcony's become a quasi-no-go zone.
Your garden inspires me.
Says his name is Quasi-something and that he isn't enjoying life in an emerging fascist state. And he says he won't go away!
No, Mother, my friend did not ring the bell this morning.
You're not even a quasi ape. Just a hunch.
You have to inspire confidence to get her to notice you.
Mory’s job got a lot harder when they invented multi-floor homes.
He introduced himself Quasimoto. But, I think he's kinda cute like Phoebus.
"Uh, no. I haven't read 'Candy'".
I'd definitely feel some compassion if he was a true hunchback, but this might just be the way he chose to sit.
No, I'm not a NIMBY Carol.
He's at it again, that Phantom of the Opera creep.
I got rid of the aphids but I still can't rid myself of Quasimodo.
He seems harmless, but it's just a hunch.
It’s the giant sucking machine
Good. I could use some shade.
We’ll always have Paris; it’s a sanctuary city.
I could just give him some water, and maybe he'll go away.
Yes, his digestive issues are much better since he took up extreme parkour.
I tend to favor my left side.
keees BEHIND ankles please
Excuse me ma'am Christianity is short on men, would you like to join us today?
So this is what you meant by a sitty view
Harvey, I'm on the phone.
“Oh, by the way, the Quasimodo guy is back at Saint Patrick’s”.
This wasn't what she meant when she said come ringing at my door.
I don't need saving, but my plants do.
I'm not a fan, Tom."

Modern Gothic Romance. (MGR)
Hold on, Beth. I think Hubert's trying to get my attention.
Victor? Well, thanks to Go-Fund-Me he got eye fixed, and he's sent me plant....Yes he's still got his hunch. NOW what?
We don't read dead white guy novels anymore.
Of course, his sneaks got lost!
You can’t use your neighbors
I have a hunch about us.
Dear, don’t you think it’s a bit dangerous to remove highway signs in the name of art?
I think he wants to eat my Boston Fern.
Faye?
Oh my gosh they've moved NotreDame and that Hunchback (what's his name), to my neighborhood. I'm sorry but he is NOT getting anything for Trick-or-Treating if he comes to my door.
W: Good Morning Tom.. M: Morning there Shiela.
I'd like to report a gargoyle malfunction, he barely spits on my plants at all.
Damn,but this little Sanctuary of mine is getting crowded...
Says his name is O’ Quasimodo?
Darling I said Ball singular
Nothing new here, how about you?
I guess the buck stopped there.
It’s Deerivative but representacial I must say.
I'm a fan of mid-nineties noir kids cartoon classic "Gargoyles" too, but this cosplay has gone too far.
I'm sorry, but you have to undate your facilities.
Can you water my hump.
Gotta go, Hon. Quasimodo creep is serenading his Esmeralda again.
Junior is a dedicated climber.
Do you have a glass of water, please?
Love, those people down below are jealous that you are an individual - I say laugh at them and let’s meet on my balcony - I’m getting a ladder.
Alexa, what happened to his back?
Barb, I see why this place was so cheap now.
Call me Quasi, but I have a hunch that I'm being watched...
Maybe the hunchback thinks I am Esmeralda.
You have a hunch he’s back... you don’t say.
Straight guys are so BORING, can I give you my number?
Yeah, sure, I'll ask him." "Hey, Hunch? Do you take requests?
I'll leave here at ONE, pick you up at TWO, and we'll arrive by THREE.
Yes, he looks just like a newborn baby.
Melania: "Donald. I am tell you I no want to visit Puerto Rico after dis. I no like dese peoples. Dey are try to take water from my plants. How come dey not know plants die if no water???"

Come here much?
Oh, I’m staying at the most darling AirBnB in this new neighborhood: UnWaHuNoDa. Under the Watch of the Hunchback of Notre Dame!
Quit ringing, Q. This is not a bell; it's a phone in the 21st century.
NO, I ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE IT!!
Yes, his name does ring a bell.
We communicate with our Pastor on much higher levels
The game app 'Quasimodo-GO!' never quite grabbed players' attention.
... I already told him, 'Stop trying to ring my bell!'
What do you say we buck the trend?
Excuse me I don't think you're zoned for potted plants
This guy across the way says he can make me a movie star.
I have to hang up now, the minister is about to pop in.
I think this guy needs help getting off the top of the tower. Should I call 911?
He's so adorable. I should write a book about him.
The poor guy needs a break room.
Our marriage is caput!
Me too.
Now THAT is one good looking woman...if I could jump on that thing without scaring her...maybe I could ask her out...nah...
Is that Mr. Pickles?????
Sure, he’s a gentleman caller.
