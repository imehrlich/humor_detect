"I'll catch it", was the last I heard.
Yours is perfectly adequate.
It looked a lot smaller online.
Well, where do you think these little balls come from?
If size didn't matter we'd all be swimming.
It was only a dollar more..
You should see his water noodle.
This "mine is bigger than yours" thing between you and your brother has got to stop, Harry.
No chance of us getting them mixed up, I initialed mine.
Costco. Why?
It keeps blowing over from Mar-a-Lago. You'd think they would build a wall.
Not Freudian. Trumpian.
He has a bigger house, a bigger car, and now a bigger ball - need I go on?
The car, the house--it's always a competition with him.
With a coupon it cost the same as the small one.
Just be patient. He goes back to Washington Sunday night and takes his ball with him.
It's right there on the label: May expand when wet.
They've appeared out of nowhere , in pools all over the world.
Thats the last time I send you to Costco
In this neighborhood, size is everything.
You really blew that out of proportion didn't you?
That's inflation for you.
That is not what B.Y.O.B. meant on the invitation.
THEIR BEACHBALL IS OUT OF ORDER. Ours goes pink, yellow, green, blue.
Are we in The New Yorker or one of those annoying adult coloring books?
Wait until you see the size of the seal.
All I heard was, "It's gonna be the biggest beach ball. The best. The greatest. Amazing. Yuge! Believ---OOF."
I guess my 'fat fingered vulgarian' joke really pissed him off.
If my neighbor asks for his ball back, just fucking give it to him.
Of course your Gay Pride is just as big as Ed's.
Last one on is a rotten egg.
But don't you see! The proper order is red, yellow, green!
I only came here to drink anyways.
It's what you do with it that counts.
He had to have a bigger car than me, a bigger house than me. I tell you Helene, it never ends!
That's so sweet of you Bob...but we already have one.
I can't put my finger on it, Carla, but this club makes me feel so inadequate.
In Mar-a-Lago, size matters.
Yes, but did you see how small his hands are?
Do you think he's overcompensating for something?
I guess that's the hole-ball of wax.
'As you can see, the Trumps got here first.'
Try rubbing it.
Bring a beach ball, you said. You'll make a good impression, you said.
Margaret was right....that bathing suit makes her butt look huge
If it stays up for more than four hours, we're supposed to call a physician.
Well, apparently more than his ego is inflated.
Plenty of guys have one ball bigger than the other.
It's payback for my reporting that his inaugural ball wasn't as bigly as some others.
I think I mixed up the Viagra and Chlorine Tablet bottles
I've found someone else.
Is it just me, or has inflation gotten out of hand?
But compared to what you've seen at other pools, mine is about average, right?
You must be new to Texas....
Just wait till you see the seal!
Maybe you should take yours over to the baby pool.
If this were a simulation, the colors would be in the same order!
They were wrong. It wasn't an asteroid after all.
I don't think you've got the ball to compete.
It's true, one of your balls is larger than the other.
No yeah, yours is totally nice too.
You haven't got the ball to compete, have you?
they blow up so quickly don't they?
Herman's neighbor had a home with a three car garage, a bigger, high end SUV, and now this?
We've sent someone to find a pin.
Trump insisted we use his ball
At least mine has the same colors..!!..
I'm gonna try to squeeze in a swim.
What part of spontaneously capricious polychromatic spherical mega-erratic subdivision do you not understand?
Hey, I tried to tell him it wasn't about size. . . but you know Donald!
Don't get too Freudian on me, Harold. It's just another man's beach ball.
This piece is called 'Covfefe'. It explores the relationship between ego and intellect.
what on earth made you pick a ball with those colors?
We're just going to have to get used to having Christo in our neighborhood.
Well, he's trying to compensate for something.
Can I sue? It copied my colors.
Your first question is why it's floating so low in the water? Really??
I guess Tom Brady overinflated this time.
Isn't the biggest house enough for that guy?
People who bought that also bought this.
What do you mean it does not match?
Where am I going to pee?
Looks like Trump got here first.
No one wants to swim, we're all out of breath.
Don't be deflated because your ball is small; you nailed the color scheme.
This must be your first Texas pool party.
Let's quietly leave. I just don't see us fitting in.
Honey, remember this is Mar-a-Lago, it's his pool, just get over it.
I get a lower rate on my insurance if no one actually swims in the pool.
Don't worry, Donnie. You can tweet that yours is bigger.
Sorry, I thought you'd have a bigger pool.
Amazon said it was 12 inches
They do this every time the lifeguard goes on a break.
Then the whole "my balls are bigger than yours" thing got kinda out of hand.
Who invited Trump's kid?
You know little Donnie needs to have the bigly, hugely, most beautiful Covfefe in the pool, right?
The ad said they had a big ballroom
I thought cold water made them shrink?
So that's a large and that's a medium?
I bet whoever's ball that is, he's wearing a Speedo.
Remember the Pool Regulations we forgot to vote on last fall ??
And you should see the size of his noodle.
Trust me. The pool is a LOT cleaner this way.
"No, seriously... You should take a picture of that hot air balloon stuck in our pool -- and then send it to 'The New Yorker' for their next caption contest. You won't believe the number of idiots who won't "get it".
We got this because we couldn't afford a life guard.
The package said size of a human head. I didn't know they meant the President.
It cost more to send it back than to just keep it.
I just wanna Make Beach Balls Great Again
It cuts down on the yelling and splashing.
I thought we weren't inviting Donald.
Will you please stop blowing it out of proportion?
There’s also Olympic size
I've been meaning to tell you, I'm seeing someone else.
It keeps people from peeing in the pool.
I got a good deal on it when Ringling Bros. shut down.
Why do you always have to one up me?
That's what I get for ordering online.
Ok , now you have something to feel inadequate about.
Yes, the president was here. Why do you ask?
How did they know the colors of my beach ball?
I can't shake the feeling their 'new' dad seems determined to win them over.
Passion for art? You're just too cheap to hire a lifeguard.
I'm so done with Texas.
I didn't know it was a competition.
I heard this voice say "Time to go to the mother ship," and suddenly here we were.
Well...this is Texas.
It's our way of dealing with the drought.
When I said you should get a pair, I was hoping they'd match
So, is this your first Texas pool party?
Honey, I like yours just the way it is.
Flashback 1949: Little Donnie Trump fulfills his boast to bring a "huge, huge" beachball to his neighborhood pool.
We're in luck. Just found a safety pin.
It's more than they are the same colors.
The Joneses called to say they can't make it, so we can lose the big one.
We bought ours at Costco.
The Rainbow Aliens apologize that their mother ship landed in your pool. They offer this unique replica gift in hopes that you will forgive them.
I'm sorry, but size really does matter.
They always have to outdo us
We decided the flag was too "in your face."
Didn't I tell you that there will always be someone with bigger, more colorful balls than yours?
They always have to outdo us
Go big or go home.
Thanks, Ted, but I think we're good.
It's beautiful! What was your inspiration?
We are going to have Mexico pay for the ball.
In case we lose the other one.
I use this one in my bathtub.
Bob, you look a little deflated.
Don't blow this out of proportion!
And over here is the "Trump pool " It's filled with hot air .
You don't have the balls to compete!
Donald got here first.
He says he wants to make pool parties great again.
No one was worrying about inflation.
It's called a covfefe: self-inflating and full of hot-air.
We've been shouting "Marco!" for hours with no answer.
Well, the colors are perfect and the catalog did say, "Dimensions may vary.".
He said he wanted one that was bigly.
The president brought it so all our hands would look tiny.
My ex found out that you were coming.
This party was overblown from the beginning.
You should see the rubber duck in their tub.
For some reason, I'm not attracted to you any more.
Look, it's not the size......well, ok, it's the size.
Do you have a pin ?
We get it, you're gay.
If it lasts more than four hours I'll call the doctor.
The guy in the store did say, "Don't get it wet."
I think size does matter.
Did you see where my other ball went?
I blame inflation.
I agree. It's neither practical nor functional. But it sure brightens up the place.
Well, I see the Joneses arrived.
Is it wrong to say this Gay Pride month thing, is getting too big.
It's garish, bloated, and vacuous – someday it could be President.
Now, that was quite a blow job.....
Yours isn't small. He's overcompensating.
Don't worry, honey. Yours is just the right size.
At least you didn't bring your noodle.
It's a temporary fix. The lifeguard doesn't start until Monday.
I keep getting reminded of why we don't like them.
Bet Dr. Freud never anticipated this one.
The Joneses win again.
I told you it would fit.
Simply point your wand at it and say "Engorgio!"
Don’t be so quick to judge.
I ordered twenty one-foot beach balls, not one twenty-foot beach ball. Darned autocorrect!
I'm seeing somebody else.
Don't be jealous, yours is ...cuter.
They bought that ball years ago and never adjusted for inflation.
With my baloon mortgage I can't swing the water and chemicals anymore.
I told you we should have brought wine.
Darling, bigly is always better, especially during these times.
No, mine is a beach ball. That's a covfefe.
You know, once upon a time, I always got the New Yorker cartoons.
They asked what the beach ball was for and I said -the pool.
I see the Trumps have arrived.
I told Christo he could house sit.
Even my acid trips are bourgeois.
The pool looked bigger in the brochure.
Oh, honey, you know size doesn't matter to me.
I guess one's enough.
Sarah thought her air balloon trip might end in drowning, but she didn't predict that no one would notice.
It's an annoyance but they haven't had a drowning in years!
Yeah... we're thinking about getting a bigger pool.
The big kid with the bad haircut just left it there.
I found a nest of these close by.
Giant Beach Ball? No! An Inexperienced Hot Air Baloonist!
Nice try.
You should see the drink umbrellas.
I think the whole thing is over blown!
Gulliver's kid never picks up his stuff.
"Yours will be equally spectacular in the kiddie pool".
The mothership has returned for its offspring.
Who knew we'd attract a Mother Ship?!
You mean to tell me these cartoons could have been in color all these years?!
Well, I guess size DOES matter ...
Last we heard he was screaming 'Marco...!'
"Looks like they already have a beach ball.
I'll bet The New Yorker is sick and tired of hearing "Size Matters."
... a new glitch has arisen in apple's urine detection software.
You never know how these new breast implants are going to react to salt water pools!
Yes Costco. How did you know.
Don't worry, Berry. Some women actually prefer a smaller one.
I guess this Gay Pride thing is bigger than we thought.
Thanks for bring yours Tom, but Pride Day at the pool is a pretty big thing here.
I've met somebody else.
Wow - finally a little extra budget to have at least partial coloring in the cartoon!
This is not want I meant about having a ball in the pool.
I should have married your brother.
We lost the pool, but now we can find our house on Google Earth.
We're gonna need a bigger pool
You're new at Mar-a-Lago!
Just so you know, its mother is watching your every move.
I thought it was like some site-specific art installation metaphor for inflation.
I brought one for the sink.
It's what you do with it that counts.
We think it's a Kardashian butt, but we are too scared to touch it
They made the president wear a swim cap.
He is compensating for his small diving board.
No, yours is a good size.
You're embarrassing me in front of my friends.
Clearly we didn't need to bring our ball too.
The Association would like you to take your ball and go home.
Ever since deflategate Tom's been over compensating.
Nah...Not too much...Anything new with you?
Understandably... but if I heard Marco Polo one more time
I told you this would happen if you didn't use ballicide.
Worst hot-air balloon landing ever.
It's cheaper than paying for a lifeguard.
One of your balls really *is* bigger than the other one.
We don't talk about the ball.
Put that little thing away! It's embarrassing.
Act like you don't see it; Phil just wants a reaction.
I'm not messing around when I say something is "yuge."
We dated a long time ago Howard, get over it.
Yours is very nice, but I don't think we need it right now
Whose idea was it to invite the Trumps?
I agreee it's utterly outrageous but it's not impeachment territory.
Does anyone know where the kids are?
Could've sworn I heard somebody yell "Marco."
But he still had two wishes left. You should see the size of the clown and the pony.
Don't worry, Harold. It's how you use it that counts.
You've got to stop shopping at Costco.
My cousins from Texas are visiting.
We never could keep up with the Joneses.
Oh, George! Why do you always have to blow things out of proportion?
This explains the Ferrari.
They're nouveau riche.
Well, I couldn't find a bigger pool but I did find this.
It seems like one of your balls is swollen.
That's the problem with you John, you never think big.
Tell Donald's mother he forgot his ball again.
Ah, Pride Week
The box said Olympic size.
I have a great personality.
I see you have the salesman sample.
This way we don't have to actually go in the water.
Blame it on Deflategate.
There is nothing "wrong" with your ball, I'd just rather play with his.
Have you seen the children?
This brings to an end the old round-peg-in-a square-hole theory
They grow up so fast
So just how long does it take to for shrinkage to occur?
Looks like someone didn't read the "Not for use in pool or shower" tag.
You spilled you Viagra pills where?
We're going to need a bigger pool.
Once again, you've blown things out of proportion.
That's nothing, you should've seen the seal.
Oh Harold, I wish you’d gotten here sooner.
Do you ever feel like you're in a New Yorker cartoon?
Trump sent it. He wanted us to have the biggest, best ball ever.
Your's is very nice too.
I don't think I want to be here when the owner comes back for his ball.
'Of course yours is big enough Frank.'
The gay agenda is coming to a swimming pool near you!
His beach ball is so confefe.
I see the Trumps have arrived.
I feel so inaqequate.
And yet the drinks are still so small.
I see SOMEONE'S dad loves their kids.
It makes the pool great again
"Let's find a smaller pool".
The funeral for the guy who blew it up is tomorrow.
Apparently he's the only one allowed two scoops of ice cream at dessert as well.
Inflation is killing me
It's for the pool I want, not the one I have.
Too little, too late, Jeff.
It's full of hot air so there must be a politician around here somewhere.
Even their pool has an inflated ego.
Never invite a Texan to a California pool party.
Donald is so competitive!
Thanks...but daddy already bought me one.
I warned you not to steal its young.
Hold this. I think there are three people still in the balloon basket.
His ego is over-inflated too.
The final fate of the wizard of Oz....
And the LSD Fridays are simply fab!
I forgot to turn the pump off.
Oh, men and their balls.
Oh, that beach ball? That's fake news.
Yea and you should see the seal that comes with it
To little too late as usual !
Have you seen Clifford?
It's the Mar-a-Lago version.
As I've told you before, size does matter!
Let's see how big it is after it gets out of the pool
Don't you think they're taking this "keeping up with the Jones" thing a bit too far...?
That must be Donald's ball.
I bought mine in Texas
It's called inflation.
Yes, but I assumed the balloon payment was for our mortgage.
Watch out for the hand that picks it up.
"Just add water", the instructions said.
My ball usually shrinks in the water
I'm so glad that the Louvre has finally embraced the LGBT.
They wanted a pool cover but accidentally ordered a covfete.
She said she wanted a splash of color.
I see Donny Trump brought his beach ball again
It's a Claes Oldenburg original.
Sometimes I just hate plastic surgeons.
There goes my pick up line
INTO the pool was the easy part.
The ball's in your pool now
I thought you meant something else entirely when you said one of your balls was bigger than the other...
He yelled "Polo," and then he drowned.
Well, this is awkward.
It popped up just after I asked for a highball.
This pool is always packed.
Let's not blow this out of proportion.
I was talking diamond ring when I said "go big or go home."
It is always smaller after it has been in the pool.
It's so hard to tell when you buy 'em online!
Well, the invited said BYOB.
And I suppose size matters?
I think we'll come to realize that we dropped the ball.
Look at the bright side, we've disproved the Archimedes' Principle.
It's Gay Pride weekend. You don't stand a chance.
Whoever's in charge of the air compressor should probably turn it off now.
Sure I’m happy. But not that happy.
He's your brother. Let it go.
Sorry I can't; out of breath!
I heard you needed a shrink.
Honey, have you seen the kids?
All my life I've thought, "Why not go big?"
Click 'FUNNY' if last week's finalists left you questioning the meaning of 'FUNNY.'
Ever hear of shrinkage?
Like I tell your father, it's not the size of the beach ball that counts, but the way you bounce it
Well, someone's over-compensating.
We're good.
We should have just gotten him a bottle of wine.
Nobody brings a New York beach ball to a Texas party.
Consider this your last year to chair the LGBT decorating committee.
Put it away.
I guess I misunderstood the evite which said to bring something for a large pool party.
We'll play with yours after Donald leaves.
Has anybody seen Barry?
He ate a double serving of the chili, changed into his rainbow Speedo, and didn't wait 30 minutes before jumping in.
Just drop it in very chlorinated water and voila...!
Q: "How do you think this pool party is going?" A: "Well, looks like everyone is having a ball!"
I tire of your perceived sense of inadequacy.
Don't let that thing get near the water.
My penis is still bigger.
Pardon me, would you happen to have a pin?
It made a big splash a few weeks ago.
If the President says it is a "Really, Really, big ball", then it is a really, really big ball..
So, who's your pool guy?
So that's a covfefe!
We asked Donald to contribute something substantial and meaningful.
I hope it accepts this offering.
I wouldn't anger the mother.
I think it's a sponge. It was smaller than yours when she threw it into the pool.
Who left the Viagra in the pool?
I decided to make my backyard a metaphor for my divorce.
Whoever did that has a lot of balls
I'm sorry honey . . .I thought they were in Mar a Lago this weekend!
In his pool back in Texas,you wouldn't even notice it.
I wouldn't feel too bad, he's just overcompensating for his tiny towel.
I told you not to throw your viagra in the pool.
Sometimes size does count.
But, where are the children?
Do you have a smaller pool I could use?
Is there a kiddie pool?
It looks a lot smaller at the beach.
Sorry sir, we have a one-ball policy
Isn't Costco great?!
They say he huffed and he puffed and he blew the thing up. Then keeled over and never got to play with it.
is this some sort of big-fish/small-pond thing?
Some would say "this Beach Ball is too big" but I say "this Pool is too small".
Are we in the right magazine? I thought these cartoons were only black and white.
My therapist said to point out when you do this.
Bigger isn't always better, Larry.
Don't worry, dear. We're obviously beginning a dream sequence.
Enjoy every moment because they blow up so fast.
Christo visits a suburb
What is it now? Ball Envy?
It only cost a dollar more!
First time at Mar Largo?
We're going to need a bigger pool.
All the directions said was to add water.
All it would take is a pin!
we're making beach balls great again!
What part of "I have a huuuge beachball was not clear?"
Try the kiddie pool.
No no Harold. Your beach ball is also great.
Have you seen the kids?
There was nowhere else to put it.
We told the Trumps there was a size limit on pool toys, but little Donald insisted.
The President is in town.
Oh look, I think I won a prize, my beach ball matches whatever that thing is!
Have you seen the kids lately?
The President brought his also.
So then I realized I'd bought the wrong size about 2 hours into blowing it up.
I don't think Marco can hear Polo.
Yes my ex is here but I wouldn't worry about it.
We need to ban pool toys.
You just missed the President.
Damn pool hog!
We shouldn't be here.
It bounced in from Mar-a-Lago.
Ironically, it turned out to be a big impediment to frolicking.
They gave it one scene in Baywatch, and now look
This party's lame - let's bounce.
I agree ... it is an interesting location for an Apple Store...
Yeah-the senior men's Aquarobics had a class this morning. Big Viagra crowd.
Someone already brought one for everyone.
Don't compare yourself to him. He's a showboat and a nut job.
I hate to say it, but I am forced to admit that size really does matter.
This is why I hate visiting the Joneses
Honey, there's no reason to feel inadequate. Remember we're in Texas.
I've found someone else.
My ex has never been subtle.
The online reviews did say the pool is small.
I hate it when he comes back to Mara Lago.
They said, "It's his resort and his pool."
It's their latest model -- the Gulliver.
We couldn't decide whether safety or inclusivity was paramount.
Maybe we should check out the wading pool.
I wasn't the only one to misinterpret BYOB.
You lose.
Well, that emptied the pool!
Size may not matter to YOU...
These pool toys are getting out of hand!
We picked it up at a Dodgers game last week.
I just hate it that the pool has gotten so competitive!
Honey, have you seen the kids?
Must you always embarrass me?
'These new balls let you know if someone's peed in the pool'
Honey, I'm gay.
You're too late. We're already having a ball.
No, Doug, I don't want to know what would happen if Mercury were captured by the Sun. I want to swim.
Wow that "don't pee in the pool system" they installed really works!
I like the color scheme in both, but that's more what I had in mind.
Somebody please tell the Giant to come get his ball!
Welcome to Mar-a-Lago. I'm afraid it is not only the President's ego that is over-inflated these days.
He had his coming out party last night.
The lifeguard is on break.
We made the pool great again!
Don't be so sensitive, dear. Size isn't that important.
Have you seen the kids?
It's a big ball. It's not indicative of anything.
I don't like my guests to feel they have to bring anything.
He did say it was going to be 'Yuge'
It's nesting.
It's a cautionary metaphor for unchecked economic growth.
Sorry, I have a boyfriend.
You know, sometimes, bigger is NOT better...
Marco?
I know we say it doesn't,but it does matter.
That ball is like his ego - hugely inflated.
Be grateful he didn't bring his Super Soaker.
I changed a few settings on the 3D printer.
I see the Joneses are here.
It's Donald's
Does this pool make me look fat?
That's sweet of you honey, but the kids already got a ball from their father.
Looks like Sully has safely landed the hot air balloon!
The other pool is much colder.
Another example of your total inability to keep up with the Jones's!
I think you need to adjust the chemicals.
Where's the Trump logo?
It seems they need a chlorinated swimming pool to nest in; we have a certified Inflataball Habitat back yard now. This little fellow is from the last litter.
One guess, they're from Texas.
It's hard to get in but once you do, you'll have a ball.
It's how you play with it.
Don't be silly. Your's is the perfect size.
We just laze around and drink, actually.
What part of 'don't add water' didn't you understand in the instructions?
What were you saying about the pool making yours shrink?
There's no room for your beach ball. We're making the pool great again.
I thought you said the water was cold.
But I did yell "heads up" before I threw it to your mother.
The inflation really is booming here.
I warned them not to let it touch the water.
I started blowing it up when I was seven.
Sorry, water polo and balloon rides have both been cancelled.
You should see the kid who owns it.
Okay, so maybe size does matter.
Looks like you mixed up the Miracle-Gro and chlorine bottles again, Harold.
We moved here from Texas
I would call it a splash of color rather than an invasion.
Hop in! There must be something in the water!
This one reads, "Keep away from water. For desert music festivals only."
Janice just got her Costco Membership
That's what happens when you take viagra and pee in the pool.
Oh. I see you already have a beach ball.
I warned you about inviting that guy from Texas.
You actually thought Christo was just going to put water in his pool?
Unlike the others, I don't judge a man by the size of his balls.
I decided to make beach balls great again.
I just like watching peoples reactions. I have an elephant in the living room.
Well, he is making everything great again, including beach balls.
I thought you needed some perspective.
Why do you blow everything out of proportion?
Ever since Donald was a little kid, he had to have the biggest balls.
I think there's a problem with one of your balls.
Don't be silly Randall - nobody else even noticed
Frankly, I find everything about Mar-a-Lago a bit overblown.
Sweetie honestly ...yours is big enough.
The invitation said NOT to bring a beach ball...but you never listen do you!
When you see him just tell him that his was the biggest.
Stop complaining and just toss it back over the fence!
Remember "magic sea monkeys?" It's like that.
Sure... But the half-life is quite reasonable.
Frank, just think of it this way: you have a small carbon footprint.
Mar A Lago has the best beach balls. Believe me. The best. Youuuuuge. All other beach balls... Losers. Sad.
Multi-lingual inflation instructions - very hard to follow
Day 1 of the beach ball apocalypse
I understand that beach ball came from the Trump collection.
Bummer man.
What did you expect here at Mar-a-Lago?
I think it blew in from Mar-a-lago.
Ok... ok... here´s a smaller one, but once the pool is full of pee, you'll see I was right.
You know what they say about men with small beach balls?
Underwhelming as usual, Norman.
I don't think you'll need that.
Looks like Ted Turner's in town.
Oh, that reminds me, I had to seat you at the kid's table.
Still think fracking is harmless?
The "good news" is we haven't had a drowning all year at the community pool!!!
When they wanted to raise our insurance premium, we decided to simply minimize our risk potential.
Put it down slowly, the mothers are very protective of their young
The directions said "Just add water."
I told you it would grow if you gave it enough water.
I guess he really meant it when he said it was going to be yuuge.
It's called a Covfefe.
Yeah, but mine came with a seal of approval.
I think you better take YOUR ball and go home.
Every McMansion needs a McBeachBall.
Well, it's his resort, and he IS the President.
The Johnsons aren't getting away with this...stay here while I get the grill fork.
Ok, don't let this one get wet.
A hologram! Neat!
We come here every year for the colors.
You better put the baby back before it notices...
It's the Mar-a-Lago management's method of enforcing their 'If the Donald isn't swimming, nobody's swimming' policy.
Everything in this neighborhood turns into a competition.
It doesn't lead to as much frolicking as you'd think.
Still going to blame the cold water?
How could you have known? It is still a lovely housewarming gift!
The President is in
You'll know him when you see him....and you WILL see him
Everybody seems to be having such a ball.
Oh, it belongs to that Gulliver guy.
It's not just the size of your ball Bob. It emphasizes your limited aspirations.
Honey, don't freak out, but my ex-boyfriend is here.
Someone's overcompensating.
It's the thought that counts.
I think Bert's still down there trying to find the valve.
I found it at the dollar store. You place the capsule in the pool and 30 minutes later you have a giant beach ball.
Huge COVFEFE
How's your switch to metric working out?
You left the gate open.
"It fell from that beanstalk yesterday".
But yours is a nice size too, honey.
I can tell you're not a blowhard.
I see you have the salesman sample.
Mine floats
Beach Ball Envy strikes unexpectedly at the Jones' last weekend.
It's ok hon, yours is much more beachier.
You just add water!
His ego is only surpassed by his balls.
I'm starting to think that the sizes at Costco are getting a bit ridiculous.
Awe, you must be Paul's little brother.
I heard the guy who blew that one up had to go to the emergency room.
You nit. I told you not to inflate with convfefe.
It's okay, honey, yours is big enough for me.
Well, I guess our summer plans blew up in our faces.
The Trumps are here too.
Oh good. I didn't want to get my hair wet.
Maybe no one will notice that we can't afford to fill the pool.
Don't let this make you feel so inadequate, George!
Have you seen my other beach ball?
But yours is so cute.
Put that away--you're embarrassing me.
...and we haven't had a single drowning since.
Well, at least it's pretty clear who the mother is.
His inflated ego is insufferable.
I appreciate your Pride honey, but i think the boys are gonna want to swim.
Mister, it takes big balls to hang out here.
Ball envy is a thing?
it said one size fits all
We are trying to save money on lifeguards.
This one keeps the kids out.
Oh, no! The Trumps are here.
So how does it feels to have one so small?
Leave it to Trump to make a big splash and leave us to pick up after him.
Well, son of a beach-ball.
You always accused me of not having big enough balls.
"As you can see, we favor the small pool big ball concept".
So I've decided size does matters after all.
Who invited Donald?
Shaq forgot to take his beach ball!
Unlike my beach ball, pool balls are large and useless.
Is Tom Brady available?
Yes, his is bigger than yours.
You and your time-shares.
It says here "may not be used a flotation device"
I told you this neighborhood was over-inflated.
After decades of tax breaks, the One Percent started to feel the impact of hyperinflation.
Somebody blew it, but who?
The urine count must be high again.
When they said they only had the one, I assumed they wanted more.
The kiddie pool is in the back.
See, bigger isn't always better.
I see the Trumps showed up.
...no doubt, yours makes the pool look way bigger.
Gee, your pool must be pretty small.
Here again, dear, size isn't everything.
You may want to read page 347 of the Homeowner's Association Policies and Restrictions.
Do you know how much it cost to use color?
It's not the heat. It's the humility.
I was tried of feeling pressured to swim.
Always gotta try and fit in, doncha?
I texted my order for 50 one-foot diameter beach balls. Spell-check changed it to this.
Why no. Is there one missing?
Guess which one's the Trump Brand Beach Ball.
Again, Brad, too little too late.
No, I haven't seen your wife.
His is bigger, yes, but mine won't get stuck.
He asked for bigly.
I think you're looking for the children's pool.
If it doesn't go away in 4 hours, call my doctor.
Global warming?
Pool parties always leave me feeling somehow inadequate.
Some recently divorced parents' kid just threw it in.
Since when do I blow things out of proportion?
They're cute when they're little.
I fired the life guard.
Don't worry, you'll bounce back.
Judy, Timmy said he wanted a beach ball sized dinosaur not a dinosaur sized beach ball!
Mom said we'd have a ball at the pool.
The invite read 'BYOB', but this is over the top.
I see your old boy frend is visiting.
This is what happens when you put Skittles in a pool full of Coke!
It's a Buckminster Fuller pool cover.
It belongs to that windbag on the third floor!
We converted it into a balloon garage.
Nobody asks about the dog anymore.
Size doesn't matter if it's too big to play with.
Why do you think this is somehow connected to the pool boy's disappearance?
This one's for the toilet tank. My water bill has gone way down.
Keep away. That is a bully ball.
"You should have seen the one that got away"!
Yep, I haven't had a kid pee in my pool for years.
Please don’t tell me you bought the sunscreen from Costco too.
Okay, we'll try yours if the merriment doesn't kick in soon.
You should see their grill.
Thanks for bringing an offering. She will be pleased.
Guess I should've brought a bottle of wine instead.
Overcompensating, if you ask me.
I thought this was a BYOB kind of a party...
No, sadly, that's actually a parachute.
I see the fine print now.
Hyperinflation hit us real hard.
Quit blowing everything out of proportion.
Your dad's already here.
You should see how big mine gets.
Three months -- but you can already see she takes after her mother.
I found this one escaping around the front.
Tell me the truth, dear...did I go too Stanley Kubrick on the centerpiece?
Maybe making beach balls out of spandex isn't such a good idea.
When did extra-large become ginormous and extra-small become regular?
These community pools are taking inclusion to a whole new level.
Little did I know she was looking for a birthing pool.
They buy everything at Costco."
Do you know how people use a towel to claim a chair?
Well, someone's over-compensating.
I told you someone else would bring a ball for the pool Harold, now we just look silly.
It's the new Trump ego beach ball.
It came over your wall, colored just like this.You must have seen it!
It looked smaller online
Right now inflation is our biggest worry.
Well, that sort of puts and end to "Marco Polo," doesn't it?
I hope nobody was still in the basket!
The Joneses got here first.
I think it's time for you to take your ball and go home.
... and it inflates a little more every time someone pees in the pool.
It belongs to the guy in the two-sizes-too-small Speedo.
Keeping up with the Jones' is getting out of hand.
It's the President's pool time.
Now I see why there is a limit of one ball per family.
The diving board is closed today.
If size mattered, would I be talking to you?
Are you sure this one's ours?
Now put that back in the birdbath where you found it.
It blew over from the Giant's game at AT&T Park
It doesn't make it impossible for people to pee in the pool, but it sure makes it harder.
We've already got a beach ball.
You were supposed to tell me when to stop blowing.
I'd say they're just compensating for the small pool.
I'm a Mac person.
You're watching the kids, right?
Please keep it away from the water
Now I know how he feels about his hands.
Well that took some balls.
Christo's latest madcap project.
Maybe that's why it says "keep away from water."
There's a lot more where this came from, babe.
Let's discuss the ball in the room.
It conserves water and it's cheaper than a lifeguard.
Build a wall? Oohhh, I thought he said "giant beach ball!"
When he told me his was much bigger than mine, I had no idea.
Oh, stop whining. Just play in the shallow end.
Well, one usually is bigger than the other...
HE SAID THE GAS STATION CHARGED A DOLLAR TO USE THE AIR AND HE USED EVERY PENNY OF IT !!
Don't worry, the average sized beach ball is 30".
Mine's easier to play with.
First "he" sucked all the oxygen out of the room and now he is sucking all the water out of the pool.
I think there's something blocking the pool filter.
Hold this while I jump at the pool.
I guess I'll just take my ball and go home.
I don't want to be here when it deflates.
Where are the children?
Careful! She's very protective of her young.
You think that's big? You should see my noodle.
The colors duke! The colors!
Our pool guy is into probiotics.
That's what I hate about hot air balloons.
The condo association doesn't want to pay for a lifeguard.
Sorry, but until Mr.Trump finishes in the bouncy house, the pool here at Mar A Lago is temporarily closed.
I have asthma.
WHY?
So that's a covfefe!
I'm leaving you, his is bigger.
Honey, you're blowing things way out of proportion.
Our pool coverage is a covfefe, what you have is a beach ball!
Lady Gaga will be out any minute.
Anyone seen Henry? He said he'd be arriving by hot air balloon.
Sorry, we have a one ball limit in the pool!
I thought it was BYOB.
Ugh, millennials.
They're so cute at that age, I just can't stand it.
Contrary to popular belief Harold, size doesn't matter.
See Dad, we can have a pool party AND be "Water Protectors" also.
I'm not sure I want to be around when he comes after it.
Bigly is always bestly
It's health and safety gone mad
It was only ten bucks at Costco.
Rather obvious, don't you think?
There are always a few glitches when you scale up from the prototype.
It's because of Trump.
We bought it before we'd decided on the size of the pool.
The cabana boy is never here when we need him.
I believe your ex is trying to make a point.
When too many people are spending money too freely, there's a risk of hyperinflation.
I like big balls, I cannot lie.
Christo's latest installation
I'd heard he had an inflated ego.
Have you noticed the size of the kids in this neighborhood?
Do you think she’ll attack if we take her baby?
And you were worried we wouldn't fit in.
Now let's not make a scene.
Some people just want to make a bigger splash!
Sure is quiet.
No, you can't borrow my hair pin.
These babies expand when wet so if you ever drop one in the toilet run like crazy.
That's why I hate ordering things online:You never know how it's going to fit!
The Kaplan's showoffery was never more in force than during their famous neighborhood pool parties.
Attention Oz-Land Guests: Would the owner of a 1939 multi-colored hot air balloon with Nebraska plates please report to the pool deck? Your party is waiting for you.
You know what they say, size doesn't matter
So much for making a big splash at this party.
They're so cute when they're young.
The hot air balloon pilot won the bet, but they are not sure he will survive.
Please tell me that's a hot air balloon that crash landed.
As usual, no one wanted to talk about the elephant's ball in the pool.
Yours is big enough, Bob.
Why did you buy me this ball without the pink stripe?
Deal with it, Lenny.
It's the Trump Effect.
Hipsters.
I meant to order 20 1-foot diameter beach balls.
Sorry but size does matter
Our pool is trying to tell us that someone just took a leak.
This way no one has to know you can't swim.
The condo board thought it might be more fun than a pool cover.
It doesn't leave much room for the imagination.
The people underneath it don't think it's funny.
Joe and I compete on everything. I guess he wins this one.
Ever since deflate-gate, Tom Brady makes sure his beach balls are inflated to their full capacity
I remember when summer was less complicated.
I asked you to get the nonabsorbent balls.
I hate Mar-a-Lago.
That's the biggest covfefe I've ever seen.
It's hard to keep up with the Joneses.
Yes, Peter IS very competitive.
We just can't keep up with the Joneses.
Anybody got a pin?
At least it stops that annoying "Marco Polo,Marco Polo
Your ball won't make America great again.
There's no way we can keep up with the Joneses.
I thought the pool caused shrinkage.
I'll be glad when his four years are over and the rest of us can use the pool again.
I wouldn't worry. I've read that it's not so unusual that one ball is a lot bigger than the other.
The pool is great again!
Tom Brady is a terrible pool party guest these days
He said that it was going to be huge.
See Richard, size does matter.
We're not sure yet. We've reduced our water usage, but we've sustained more concussions.
That was your first wish?!
'Biggest' and 'useful' are different things.
It must be something in the water.
This is our souvenir from Texas.
They said, drop it in the water and watch it grow. I guess they weren't kidding.
Have you noticed how the neighborhood is really changing?
Do you think our sibling rivalry has gotten out of hand?
Please throw your sacrifice into the pool.
Sure, it's bigger. But mine doesn't require a flatbed truck.
Had I known, I'd have brought dip instead.
Now I know why it was on sale.
I kept the gift receipt.
Ha, ha...very funny, Helen! You've never taken my fetish seriously.
Be careful what you wish for.
It's really okay if yours isn't the biggest.
Actually, I'd never been invited to a beach ball party before.
Our host says we can jump in after four hours.
As you can see, the pool's still loading.
Your from Nebraska. Everything is bigger here in Texas.
Fine, we'll get a bigger pool...
What good is a golden parachute if you can't swim?
Do you notice that the more we watch it, the bigger it gets. (With apologies to Gahan Wilson. I know this won't even be considered, but I couldn't resist.)
Trust me, John, it's nothing compared to penis envy.
Where's mom?
I don't know, maybe balance it on the top of your drink or something and walk around with a wry smile.
Don't worry honey, it's not the size that counts.
The parachute's a little loud but you have to admire his aim.
Well, someone's compensating.
... maybe we just put this one down and walk away slowly ...
The covfefe is beautiful this time of year
Todd was once again reminded that size does matter.
Well they did say only one toy...
At Sunnycrest, we go big or go home.
I really see the difference on my water bill since going green.
I wonder where that hot air balloon landed.
I guess someone didn't want us to go in the pool.
Got a pin ?
Welcome to Texas!
I'm sorry Doug, size does matter.
Go figure- most shrink when wet.
I told the agency we needed a really large bouncer.
Junior heard that Barron Trump is here today.
The 'everything's bigger in Texas' thing is beginning to grate.
Scuba lesson then a balloon ride?
Nice gesture, but we voted for a larger pool.
Every time we shop at Costco we buy more than we need.
Give me some credit...I blew it up myself.
Either they didn't pay the pool guy or Mia got into Georgetown.
I'm simply saving the water for my rose beds during climate change season.
Dammit, Bernice. Now nobody's going to notice my ball.
You win - bigger is not always better.
Don't worry--yours is average-sized.
I hope yours is made in the USA, the one's from China tend to swell up in water.
Well that's one way to keep the kids from peeing in the pool.
Absorbent. I didn't expect that.
I find it a bit ostentatious.
I. Think we are gonna need a bigger pool.
White folks at the Colored pool
...it's behind me, right?
You must have a really small pool.
That's the last time I ask a tuba player to blow up a beach ball.
I don't know why I feel so inadequate!
I knew we should have gone to Costco.
Trump brought it.
You'll never be half the man your father is.
It looked smaller online
Talk about inflation!!!
I told you sweetheart. Sometimes things can be too large to effectively play with.
Just get the damn pin already...
I promise, the cold water led to the shrinkage.
This neighborhood one-upmanship has got to stop, Maude!
Yes dear, I'm sure he's just compensating for something.
Is it normal for one ball to be bigger than the other?
I see your point, Mark, but some things, like closet space, are still better when bigger.
Welcome to Texas, and thanks for the pretty ping pong ball.
Honey, yours is just fine.
Enjoy it. They grow up so quickly.
It's Trump's beachball.
Bigger is better, Gary. It's ALWAYS better.
It's my subtle way of letting the association know they should construct a larger pool.
With the water ban, this is the only way I can fill the pool
Ok. If it lasts more than four hours we see the doctor.
They should have thrown it back by now.
It's Patrick McGoohan's pool.
We shouldn't have kept feeding it after it killed the pool boy.
Care if I just bounce something off you?
Yes, yes, I can see that...but are we having FUN?
Beach Ball Water Birth is actually a pretty good band name.
Our water bill is a fraction of what it used to be ....
It's all a matter of perspective, isn't it?
Well, the vacation brochure did say limited swimming hours.
That looks fun too....only smaller.
I hate Christo's pool parties.
It looked smaller in the store.
There's proof that you CAN have too much of a good thing!
I like big balls, and I cannot lie.
I can't believe that hot air balloon landed right in the pool!
Damnit, the Giants promised they were going to be away this weekend!
Go big or go home.
Donald insisted on bringing HIS beach ball!
It started out as a clever Viagra promotion but somehow it went rogue. We're hoping it lasts less than 4 hours.
Only one ball in the pool at a time please.
I named mine Pluto.
As you can see, that won't be necessary.
Does this pool make me look fat?
That is when George realized that he was completely inadequate for this pool party.
Took me a week to blow up the one in the pool.
(Diagram not drawn to scale.)
This is just my starter beach ball.
The kiddie pool is way too small at this club.
I can't compete with that !
He did say the pool party was going to be a ball.
It starts out like this, grows bigger collecting water samples, then takes off to Mars!
The Jones always have to be bigger.
I knew there would be a problem when Trumps relatives moved in, got to have the biggest
Another swim diaper.
Safe to say you can take your ball and go home.
First it was the over the top Christmas lights
Make America inflate again.
Proof, bigger is not always better.
I heard the pool's a ball.
No fertilizer. Just plenty of water and sunshine.
I know yours isn't as big as his, but that really isn't important to me.
It's not a reflection on your manhood, Michael.
Of course, it's only a prototype.
Seriously Janice, after last year's corn dog incident, I knew Lennie had ego problems...but I didn't think he'd take it this far.
See if you can locate an ice pick.
This little ball, the directions said put in water, so I did!
The baby pool is to the left.
Anyone have a giant needle.
Sweetie, size isn't everything.
It's called a trump ball.
When that hot air balloon flew over our pool party, I knew it was a bad omen!
See Helen....sometimes bigger is NOT better!
It's what you do with it that counts… right?
Someone else's is always bigger, Jerry.
They are never as big as the sample!
First, it was ‘The 800-pound gorilla.’ Then, ‘The elephant in the room.’ If they continue to ignore it, it’s just going to keep growing larger and more ridiculous every year.
They thrive on chlorine and pee.
I told you to keep an eye on the kids
Your ball is nice and all, David. But Brent's is a little more to my liking.
Call the Weather Channel and tell them we found their balloon.
Let's not give it back this time.
Don't worry. Yours will look bigger in the kiddie pool.
Did you see my other ball?
Well, it's certainly not Tom Brady's pool.
She wants her baby back NOW.
You can add color, but it still doesn't make any sense.
Who cares if his is bigger. I didn't marry you for the size of your beach ball. That's for sure!
It's pool covfefe time
Looks like he's overcompensating for something.
"Sometimes I think everything really IS about you.'
George wanted me to tell you his is bigger.
Don't you know when to stop blowing???
Looks like the Trump's are arriving.
I would have been here sooner, but I couldn't find my flip flops.
It's an 'in your face' swim party.
Apparently, size matters.
Goodness, gracious, great ball of satire!
We need to drain the pool so there is space for everyone's beach ball, he said
Where is Timmy?
This is why we can't have nice things.
We are conserving water
We adopted
Yep, one is a little swollen. Should I be concerned?
Why does she keep dating someone with such an over-inflated ego?
I brought an extra just in case.
So Susan, I guess size DOES matter to you.
That's inflation for you.
It's not the worst thing I've seen in the water.
Half the people wanted a pool party and half wanted a bounce house. So, I got creative.
Well, size isn't everything...
Everyone sees it happening, but nobody does anything until it's too late.
Ugh. You and your sense of inadequacy.
They say we're in a market bubble, but I've yet to see any evidence.
Where are you putting that one , in the toilet?
I think you want the wading pool.
Yes, it IS multi-cultural, but you'll still be renting from Jared Kushner.
Do you always have to blow things out of proportion?
Ann, I asked you not to invite King Kong again.
Oh, Costco. Why, where did you get yours?
Wait until you see his lounge chair.
It's a gay thing, you wouldn't understand.
Size has nothing to do with it.
It's too little too late.
I told you we should have used the small one.
The lifeguard cost too much.
I never knew ball envy could be a thing.
Don really is competitive, isn't he!
As with cable TV, the beachball charge is included in your monthly homeowners' association fee.
I adjusted for inflation.
Apparently size DOES matter.
Hi, I'm here for the pilgrimage.
The one in the pool is his approval rating as he estimates it. The one I'm holding represents his actual approval rating.
The lifeguard quit.
But yours is nice, too.
I've told you: Bigger isn't always better.
I'm leaving you, Brandon. Size does matter.
I'm afraid I don't have as much hot air.
Somebody should tell the Jolly Green Giant to get his own pool.
We just got back from Texas.
The catalog only said it comes in small and large.
We love summer. Bigly.
There has been a lot of inflation in the neighborhood.
I was expecting to see him shoot it out his ass.
Yeah, I know how absorbent they are!
Jimmy was right; his ball is bigger.
My inferiority complex is kicking in.
And look what you have got for the same price!
She wants her baby back.
Trying to make beach balls great again?
The big kids ruin it for everyone.
No, dear. My beach balls aren't ruining the party. It's your negative attitude that's ruining the party.
When you order everything online, sometimes you accidentally buy a twenty-four foot beach ball.
Is this your subtle way of coming out?
It's an exclusive rainbow coalition pool party.
So this is where my son Goliath's ball landed.
What other beach ball?
We made our swimming pool great again!
First time at Mar-a-Lago?
By pump or mouth?
I thought they said no flotation devices!
You said "covfefe" three times, didn't you?
Careful, don't get the mother ball angry.
There's no reason to be insecure, honey. Everybody knows they'll shrink in cold water.
Welcome to The Rainbow Coalition pool party!
It's big, it's beautiful, and strangely enough, Mexico is paying for it.
The rich are different from you and me.
But, where are the children?
Somewhere over the rainbow is a place where I can swim laps.
This balloon payment thing doesn't sound so great after all.
Can you hold this? I need to call my therapist.
I hate it when the President drops by unannounced.
Don't be taken in by their inflated sense of importance, Hon.
You must be looking for the little boy's pool.
Everyone is calling it 'Trump's Ego'.
How about we try the kids pool.
thanks for the offer, but what I really need are some bigger kids.
Life Guard not on duty.
Apparently it expands when it gets wet.
Why don't you take that to the kiddie pool.
Have you seen Trump's ball?
It's the new iBall 7.
This way, I got free shipping.
Size isn't everything.
Spoilsports.
"Make sure you take your Viagra out of your pockets before jumping in the pool Dear".
Have you seen Billy?
Tiny hands too?
Tell your little friend to be patient—adult swim is almost over.
A giant beach ball? That's your solution to global warming?
No one has been brave enough to peek inside!
You really know how to take the pool out of 'pool party'.
Oh Harold, yours is big too.
I told you it was too big. I hope you kept the receipt.
Looks like the iPool app has crashed.
One word: plastics.
Oh, the humanity!
How come it doesn't float?
I bought mine at the dollar store
Don't feel inferior - I brought the Zinfandel.
His manhood was in question pure and simple.
And if it did that to a beach ball, imagine what it can do to-" "STOP!
There is actually a trend toward bigger beach balls.
Must be steroids in the water
Would you direct me to the kiddie pool?
This one doesn't suffer from an inflated ego.
Let's just avoid the whole subject of balls, ok?
You can't blame this on "shrinkage."
Why does everything always have to be about you?
How many times do I have to tell you size doesn't matter?
Have you tried restarting?
Did you really think that was going to cut it at MY pool party?
Be careful with it around water.
My new boyfriend's from Texas.
Bullocks.
Welcome to Nightmare-A-Lago.
Why isn't there water everywhere?
When the invitation said, 'Annual Beach Ball': I thought it meant just a pool party.
That is the last time you use the tire inflator to blow up a balloon.
That's your problem, Gerald. You never think big enough.
Don't worry about it, they're obviously overcompensating for something.
We re-purposed the pool due to rising insurance premiums.
Relax Bob, you fit right in.
Who invited POTUS?
The directions said "Just add water."
It was at that moment they realized the true meaning of "be the ball."
Everything's bigger in Texas.
Looks like Gulliver is back in town.
It's one-percenter swim.
I think he said he was the great and powerful something or other.
Everything's bigger in Texas, honey.
He purchased it after learning that the world's largest swimming pool is in Mumbai
Did I tell you that this place takes great pride in its balls?
They inflated with trump gas.
It's like this but bigger
The beach balls here at Mar a Lago are huge!
It's not your everyday pool party.
Just got the scoop, it's filled with political hot-air.
the Jones's brought their ball
If we don't look at it, does it really exist?
See, size does matter.
I still like you Howard.
Honey, have you seen the other expanding sponge ball?
With the water shortage, one has to adapt.
I told you the fortune cookie said, "Go big or go home."
Not you. I want my genes to be perpetuated by whomever blew that big ball up.
I told you size matters
Are you gay?
Listen Bob, you're going to have to learn how to play with the BIG boys!
Sometimes they get bigger in the pool.
Honey, how many times have I told you size doesn't matter?
President Trump is ready to see you now
Adult swim?
Sweetheart, you told me that you purchased the biggest beach-ball in town!
I thought you said size didn't matter
Either the beach ball is too big or the pool is too small.
Gee, thanks, hon, but George already brought one.
I feel so much more in tune with the small fish, big pond way of life.
I wish LGBT would hold their meetings elsewhere.
It's not the size of the -- no, it's actually the size that matters.
I'm eager to see how your sky redesign turns out.
Those Trump kids are back from vacation.
It's not the size, it's how you use it.
Water volleyball was a great idea for a kids party. I haven't heard a peep since they started playing.
That's sweet of you. My new boyfriend's is bigger.
Any chance you have a pump I could borrow?
Don't worry sweetie, you know what they say: big ball, little hands.
This isn't what I meant by go big or go home
"Trump will be a great neighbor you said! He has no interest in us little people you said! He'll be good for property values, you said! We won't know he's building a development near us! you said...........
We are facing a crisis of exaggerated proportions.
We bought it in Texas.
Yes, we started by buying the ball.That was right before the recession.
I'm all for gay pride - but I think this is going too far
Can we now agree that BYOB was not in reference to balls?
Has anyone seen my ball?
That's a totally different ballgame.
So much for the 'shrinkage' excuse.
OMG! Talk about hyperinflation. This is ridiculous.
The President insisted his had to be the biggest.
I thought balls were supposed to shrink in cold water.
I find there is shrinkage when I get wet.
I blame inflation.
Eureka?
On the plus side, I shouldn't have to worry about "shrinkage."
We already have one.
My beach ball is bigger than your beach ball.
Thank you all for coming out to "7th Grade Gym Class Day" here at Smith's Public Pool.
