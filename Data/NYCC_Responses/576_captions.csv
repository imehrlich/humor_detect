Don't blow my cover. I'm in the middle of a sting operation.
Ignore me and I'll go away.
Our parents won't approve; you're Jewish and I'm a Wasp.
Could be worse...I could be back at the White House doing press briefings.
I can't go. I've been elected queen.
You still have two wishes left, right?
I got caught in a sting operation.
The doctor says it's the worst case of hives he has ever seen
I told you I had hives.
Hold on a sec. I need to buzz you in.
Now am I WASP enough for your father?
Honey, can you find my epipen?
I’m the head beekeeper!!!
Go get your bear costume
Worker bee was the only job I could get with my liberal arts degree.
Hang on, I'll buzz you in.
Air Bee&Bee
I've been busy.
... It began when wax started building up in my ears.
Honey, beelieve me, for NYC it's pretty spacious.
Remember me as I was when you have honey, honey.
Is he still President?
So you thought it just meant White Anglo-Saxon Protestant?
I traded our cow for these magic bees.
It's just like being a real wasp, but without the cocktails and sanctimony.
The ringing in my ears was nothing compared to this buzzing.
Has your mother left?
I get my news from BuzzFeed, mostly.
Look, she means nothing to me. YOU'RE my queen.
And for my third wish I said I wanted to be the head of a large organization.
No, Air Bee & Bee.
I'm sorry, I only date WASPs.
What? I told you I worked with drones.
Less is less.
She's still a queen, Carol. When she invites you in, you go.
"Can you please bring me my yellow jacket"?
I just wanted to see what all the buzz was about.
Your Grandmother was right Doris, they do have knees!
It's an Air Bee-n-Bee.
Leave? But they just made me queen.
It's small, but it has a sense of community.
I found this place through Air Bee and Bee.
I'm part of an undercover sting operation.
I understand this isn't what you expected from therapy. I just know I'm happy now.
At least I don't live with my parents.
Just go. I'll only end up hurting you.
I can't come home. They elected me queen.
And "they", as you call them, happen to LOVE my humming.
I do love you, but I'm just not ready to leave the nest.
The ad said 'Air Bee n Bee'
The constant buzzing sound is driving me nuts.
And don't call me "Honey".
If I'd known your mother is a witch, I would have been nicer to her.
After a while it's like, what bees?
Is your mother gone yet?
Not gay, Deborah... I'm a queen.
This is definitely worse than the doghouse.
It's more of a buzzing than a ringing.
Tell the little troublemaker there's a pinata in the park.
To be fair, you cropped your profile picture too.
Finally! An organic, sustainably-sourced tiny house!
I said behave yourself, not bee hive yourself.
I actually do find you attractive, witty, and educated. But, trust me, you will meet someone better than me. Plus, I'll die within minutes if we have sex.
You're not the queen here.
Well, I think I'm a keeper.
They have a tasting room.
Can you go get my EpiPen ?
So you put on a flowery dress and think I'll just fly back?
One sec, I'll buzz you in.
Never tell an angry wizard to buzz off.
It replaces acupuncture in our new health plan
I'm on an undercover sting operation.
I think I found out what's been making the noise.
I wanted to know what all the Buzz was about
Maybe I just need some space.
The Queen will see you now.
The worst part is the constant buzzing in my ears!
You do know that the customary place of banishment is the dog house?
It's a sting operation.
Tell me you brought the EpiPen.
Could you help me out of this honey?
Not until he's out of office.
No, I do NOT want to talk about the "honey do" list.
The buzz around me is incredible
The hardest part has been giving up smoking.
I'm part of a sting operation.
The doctor said it was hives.
What makes you think I'm avoiding you?
So then he said "I triple dog dare you" and well, I wasn't gonna let him make me look like a fool.
I'll give you a million dollars for an Epi-Pen.
Bring Johnny on out. I'm ready for the talk.
It’s not a hive mentality. It’s a state of beeing.
Last week I learned about the birds.
This time of year, I tend to break out in hives.
Turns out it's an Airbnbee.
Maybe we should go to your place instead.
I'm fine. It's just hives.
It was either this or move back in with my parents.
Her majesty will see you now
The square footage isn't great but the building has 500 doormen.
I've already learned two things about bees: 1. They're temperamental. 2. These are hornets.
Let me buzz you in.
I just don't think it's a good time to stir things up.
I'm organizing the workers
I've got hives.
Have your parents left yet?
Can you speak up? I've got a buzzing in my ears.
And to top it off, I've always been a really good speller.
My profile clearly stated: half Jewish half wasp.
I wanted to see what all the buzz was about.
You're Jewish and I'm a WASP, it will never work.
I moved out. I'm with my new honey now.
First, thanks for not swinging a bat this time.
One kiss and you'll be done with fillers and plumpers.
I told you I had hives.
I found it on Air Bee & Bee.
Why can't we buy honey at the supermarket like everyone else
You won't believe where I found your keys.
They said I was a keeper.
Do I criticize your friends?
Is that you 99?
A floral print? Really?
Witness protection program. And you?
I’m conducting a sting operation.
I'm sorry...did you buzz?
Do you have anything for hives?
Well, an epipen would be nice.
It was either this or your relatives.
May I please return to the dog house?
Has your mother left?
Ok, I admit I was wrong - 'Air Bee and Bee' is not the same thing after all.
Yep, I'm the new queen. They wanted an outsider.
The diagnosis...I have hives...
I booked it on AirBeeNBee.
Well, there's a great sense of community here and I'm keeping busy. It's all good.
Sorry, my research comes first.
I can't talk long or the queen will get suspicious.
Most people find it difficult to get close to me.
And all this time I thought it was tinnitus.
I'm going to surprise Pooh. It'll be funny.
Let me buzz you in.
The queen asked me to dinner.
Sure, it's roomier. But the anthill is closer to downtown.
I can verify that each individual is busy and contributing.
I know I don't look exactly like my picture...
My GPS really screwed up this time.
I wanted to see what the buzz was all about.
It'll never work, Sylvia. You're Jewish. I'm wasp.
I'm pretty sure this is worse than being in the doghouse.
I just think we should see other species.
I lied when I said I needed more space.
How I got in here is beside the point. The bees want me out asap.
Could we forget the caption for now? Just get me out of here.
I asked myself THE question.
They're not as organized as one might think.
I've been getting some great buzz lately
My friends like your dress.
I'm in it for the honey
I told you I break out in hives.
No wi-fi and paper-thin walls, so no I won’t be using air bee & bee in the future
Your words actually sting more.
I don't know how this happened, honey. I was reading Kafka and then suddenly . . . .
Buzzfeed starts here. You wouldn't believe what these drones come back with.
Could be worse - I used to be a piñata.
Well... yes I am the head bee keeper but how did you know?
Did you bring my epi-pen?
They made me queen for a day.
Do you have an EpiPen?
What makes you think I'm trying to hide from you?
The rent is cheap, but the landlords are busybodies.
Oh, 'behave'... that makes more sense.
Whatever Kelly. In here I'm the queen.
I'm completely buzzed.
No, the buzzing isn't the worst part.
You look like my type, but I've been stung before.
I have a hive mentality
I thought all that buzzing was poor cell reception
I have a persistent buzzing in my ears.
Yeah. It stings.
I'm learning to just bee.
It's over, Mitzy. The queen's forgiven me and I need to be a father to my zillions of children.
Sometimes, the bees keep you.
Yes, I know I'm supposed to be in the doghouse. I guess I got that wrong, too.
I'm part of an undercover sting operation.
Hi honey.......hi honey!
It's an air bee and bee
I have a great idea for your next hairstyle.
The doghouse was occupied.
This whole local food movement has gotten out of hand.
Avoiding you?! That's insane, Margaret. You're being really insane now.
I probably should have told you this sooner, but I'm a queen.
To be or not to be a bee, is no longer the question.
Please speak louder, there's a buzzing in my ears.
I'll buzz you in.
I told you that I am a WASP.
Why yes! I am a white anglo-saxon protestant, why do you ask?
I knew you wouldn't understand.
There are so few places a true WASP can feel comfortable today.
Well, YOU try finding an affordable one bedroom in San Francisco .
Can you very quietly get me a cigarette?
Honey, I can't hide it any longer; I'm a queen.
It's me, honey.
I don't think the queen likes me."
I've think I've figured out the answer to Hamlet's question.
I found it on Airbnbee.
They say I'm the new face of apiculture.
The doctor said it was the worst case of hives they'd even seen.
Lady, how this happened is none of your bee's wax.
Let me know when your mother leaves.
I'm totally buzzed.
I went through all the electrical and everything checks out, but I can't seem to locate that buzzing sound you were talking about.
I'm only in it for the buzz.
I'm a little buzzed
I'll come home when the buzz wears off.
This was your third wish? Really?
I'd rather be in the doghouse
Is Trump still in office?
... and then one day the beekeeper becomes the beekept.
My healthcare plan dropped acupuncture.
They never complain that I work too much.
Her Majesty requires an appointment.
Oh, after a while you don't even notice the bees; it's the bears that get you down.
You're leaving me? Well that stings Helen, it really stings.
It's a little cramped, but they say the schools are amazing.
So this is why you asked me to wear a dress with flowers on it.
It beats being Press Secretary.
That dress isn't working. Do you have one with sunflowers or lilacs?
I told you my family aren't typical wasps.
No, actually I'm Jewish.
But I didn't lie on my dating profile. I said I was very WASPY guy.
So I guess it's only cool when Jane Goodall does it.
What did you think I meant by WASP?
I would advise against pissing me off, Louise.
All I can hear is buzzing
Honestly Honey, the Queen and I are just good friends.
For my third wish, I told the genie I wanted to be treated like royalty.
You don't look anything like your profile picture.
I'm sorry, the Queen's not here. May I take a message?
Yes, I am that Burt.
Just seeing what all the buzz is about.
What'd you learn from the birds?
The doctor said this is the worst case of hives he has ever seen.
I told you I came from a large family of WASPs.
Date a WASP, they said.
It's a long story.
You knew I was a WASP.
It masks my tinnitus.
To become a WASP, you must learn to think like one.
I can't leave now, they made me queen.
Who are you calling honey?
I said I won't sleep with you because you don't have enough MONEY
Jane Goodall faced a lot of skepticism at first, too.
Can't you see we're busy?
Oh, and it's all right when you spend the day with your WASP friends.
This cartoon makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.
Once you get your feet in the rest is easy.
I'm transitioning. Can't you just be supportive?
But it's in our price range AND it has a great view of the park.
Have you seen my EpiPen?
Well, you don't exactly look like your dating profile picture, either.
My profile photo might have been too tightly cropped.
Not until your mother leaves.
When you said "A swinging top floor conversion in a part of town that's been getting a lot of buzz lately." I pictured it differently.
I'll come out when your mother leaves.
I can't believe you found me. Did you really count to one hundred?
Busy. You?
Just let me know when your mother leaves.
You told me to mind my own beeswax.
I'm mostly worried about bears.
Well, I don't think YOU look like your Tinder picture either.
This will put us in the right district for her preschool.
Oh, come on, Lisa. We hardly ever hang out with my friends.
"You have to understand the 'hive mentality'.
You're right, honey. I do tend to drone on.
I'm flattered, but we both know moving back in together would just stir up a hornet's nest.
I've learned to embrace my waspiness.
I got a job with Buzzfeed.
If anyone calls, just tell them I'm busy.
I love your dress.
To taunt Mildred, the bees in her yard formed her old boyfriend's features out of wax.
I'm sure I mentioned the hornet's nest in my family tree.
Sorry I haven't called. I've been busy as a ... never mind.
To bee or not to bee--I chose the former.
Reincarnation is real. Tell everyone.
So this dude tells me he has this pill that will guarantee a constant buzz.
I can explain.
Again, the queen's tweets speak for themselves.
I identify as a bee.
It's time to come out as the raging queen that I am.
Now you can tell your father that you're engaged to a WASP.
Why can't you just buy a pinata like everyone else?
Meet me later under the porch.
The doctor thinks it may be tinnitus.
Wanna hear the latest buzz?
I wanted to see what the buzz was all about.
I hate it when you break out in hives.
Well, it beats spending time with your mother.
It's WASP, not hornet.
The ad said '...charming studio with 360 degree views', but never mentioned the roommate situation.
This hammock looked more comfortable in the catalog.
Sigh. This feels like a New Yorker cartoon.
Honey?
It's not as roomy as some affordable housing options but it comes stocked with food and its own security system.
The good news is...I don't have tinnitus after all.
It was a steal, but the shared bathroom is always swarmed.
You look just like your profile picture.
Has your mother gone?
Yes, I'm Sting. Don't stand so close to me.
When Buzzfeed included free housing in their offer, how could I refuse?
So much for plan Bee.
That's not the question.
I'm part of a sting operation.
Why are you always such a buzzkill?
Working. You?
Of course I'm being stung, Angela. But at least the bees never complain about the way I load the dishwasher.
Relax, Honey, witness protection has assured our safety.
And so instead of simply trying to save them, I became one.
Just because I hang out with other wasps doesn't mean I don't appreciate your temple friends.
We're just a little busy right now.
You technically get three wishes, but we highly recommend 'don't sting me' for the first one.
I'm sorry. Could I bother you for a spoonful of Benadryl?
The bee's knees, my ass...they wanted it all.
I've had just enough of you always being the Queen Bee
'Are you the girl who kicked the hornet's nest?'
No, it's not in here. Check your bag again.
I'm here to meet the queen.
Just kiss me to break the spell and I'll pay for the bee stings, the Epipen and your Medic Alert bracelet.
Would you mind getting the benadryl?
I can't leave now. I just made drone.
I think they have begun to accept me as one of their own.
But honey, I'm in the middle of an undercover sting operation.
Sure, it's smaller than the other apartments we've seen, but the 24hr security is terrific!
Say, could you be a dear and grab my epipen?
Just keep walking. I'm working an undercover sting operation.
Well, you don't look like your profile photo either.
Actually, it's less painful than going back to Washington.
You've never heard of a King bee?
There's a reason I left you, honey.
It's still bigger than a New York studio apartment.
Have you seen my yellow jacket?
Did you bring the EpiPen?
I wanted to live in a Waspier neighborhood.
I'm through with all the lies and the pretense...I'm a queen.
Well, you don't look like your profile picture either.
Now you tell me about the birds.
Do you have any allergies?
Eat your heart out, micro-apartment hipsters.
I have to tell you - I don't think a kiss is gonna do it.
Staying busy, how about you?
I don't mean to be all weird about it, but I really could use my EpiPen sooner rather than later.
What if I waive the broker's fee?
It’s over, I’ve found my queen
I thought you said, ‘beehive yourself.’
I'm just saying, dressed like that you're kinda asking for it.
Absolutely love the dress.
I said be-HAVE yourself.
I can't hear you, I have this weird buzzing in my ear.
Think about how I feel.
Has your mother left yet?
I'll move back in the house when your mother moves out.
I'm the head of the colony.
Do the little dance to show me how to get home.
Out there I had no friends.
It's Brooklyn; it's affordable.
No, you buzz off.
Must I get you out of every sticky situation?
Don't you think you've taken this 'Small Houses' thing a little too far?
My profile said I was a Wasp.
Never seen a B type?
Sometimes, the bees keep you.
Please bring me an epi-pen.
I'll buzz you in.
Well, nice trick but can you do anything else?
I'll explain later, just go get my EpiPen.
Still feel like bashing my face in?
When is your mother's visit over?
They'll never accept you because you're Catholic.
I think I might be adopted.
What do you mean, ‘Tinnitus is the least of my issues’?
Honey, when you said there was a queen inside you, I had no idea.
I finally feel at one with nature.
Home, I'm honey!
'Money'? I thought you said get off your butt and make some 'honey.'
What? I'm nesting!
They have accepted me as their queen. These are my people now.
I also plan to float like a butterfly.
Who knew man-keeping was a bee thing?
That's right, I booked it through HairBeeNBee.com.
Honey, this isn't what it looks like..
I can't wait to be an empty nester.
I'm not avoiding you-I've just been really, really busy.
I serve a new queen now.
Did you kill the spider?
This may sting a little.
I told you to take it easy on the "Burt's Bees" products. Now look what happened.
I can safely say, "Honey I'm home.
Well, if I did have a body and if I didn't live in a beehive, would you go out with me?
That is the question.
It gives me a real sense of community.
I'm not going to the doctor. It's one hive, not hives.
That's not what I meant by "Plan B"
What makes you think that I don't want to talk about it?
Then I told the genie that I wanted to have a queen and thousands of servants.
You were right, honey. That buzzing sound I kept hearing really was all in my head.
Have they left yet.
Now listen carefully. Go into my laboratory and bring me the formula for "attracting money". I think there may be a typo.
No. I said I was feeling hornet.
Shhh...I'm playing hive and seek.
I CANNOT CAPTION A CARTOON THAT DOES NOT SHOW UP ON THE SCREEN. WHY IS THIS HAPPENING (WEEK AFTER WEEK)? Please respond and correct this flaw in the system.
Loraine, the best way to effect change is from inside the system.
Sorry I can't hear you. I have this constant buzzing in my ears.
It's a sting operation.
Remember when I was your queen?
I may have misrepresented myself on JDate and for this I apologize.
Since you ask, I'd really like it if you'd bring me my epipen.
I'm pretty much completely off grid now.
You're no queen, Helen.
To bee or not to bee-- I'm still deciding.
Believe me, it wasn't easy.
What do I have to do to get you to stay away from me?
What else can I do to prove Russia's involvement?
What'd you expect? The Cheshire cat?
Please don't give me away. I'm part of a sting operation.
Pretend you didn't see me. It's a sting operation.
Honey, what did I say about bothering me at The Man Hive?
The Queen invited me.
"...so I laughed and said, 'No, I don't believe in magic,' and, well, here we are.
I realize that seeing me like this must sting a bit.
Can we at least agree that the children will be raised as pollinators.
Really bad case of hives.
Hi, I'm Burt. I have a cosmetic line you'll love.
It's small, and temporary, but the rent is too low to pass on, and I really feel part of a community here.
I'm simply saying 'Don't quit while you're a head.'
I'm afraid I have a natural tendency to drone on.
It’s surprisingly roomy for a City studio and you can’t beat the Central Park view.
Have you seen my yellow jacket, honey?
So what did you think when you married a WASP?
It's QUEEN Larry, now.
I can't wait to become an empty nester.
What really stings, Brooke, is the way you spurn my affection.
So, long story short, I've been doing really well since we broke up.
Karen, I've been living a lie – this is the real me
Maybe not now, maybe not tomorrow, but someday you'll agree that we're just too different.
The queen and I are just friends. Nothing more, I swear.
Who's the queen bee now?
No, dear, I'm no longer a beekeeper. The bees are keeping me now.
I'll give you a buzz.
I just feel safer in here.
The doctor said it was hives.
Have you seen my keys?
Maybe I'm just not as ambitious as Spiderman.
You don't look like your profile pic, either.
If you were old enough to know who John Belushi was, you'd think this was funny.
Well, if you took the entire tab, that would certainly explain the hallucination.
I'll never work out. Your family is Jewish and, well, I'm a WASP.
You know, "Hive Mentality" is a lot more nuanced than people think.
Maybe YOU'RE a disembodied face protruding from a hornets' nest.
This is still better than being in the house with your mother.
Your mother will handle the birds part.
I think I preferred the dog house.
Airbnb said it had a huge buzz factor.
It's all part of the tiny house charm.
I booked it through AirB&B.
They don't like it when you call me 'honey.'
It's the bears I'm worried about, not the bees!
"Honey?"... Don't you "Honey" me!
I'm getting hives.
Or you could just accept the subpoena.
Yeah, my family is pretty WASPy.
Remember when I said nothing could be worse than that time I got trapped in an ant hill?
Tell them I'm coming down with hives.
I suppose you came to see what all the buzz is about.
They respect me up here, and that's "Queen" Gary to you, Helen
... And then I said, 'Take me to your leader!'
Did Mueller call?
We have plenty of workers and drones, but we need a queen.
Can't you just buy it from a farmers market like everyone else?
With all the extra ear wax I barely notice the buzzing.
Wanna get a buzz on?
I got caught in a sting operation.
What DID you mean when you told me to mind my own beeswax?
Is it too soon to call you 'honey'?
Thank god—I thought you were the bear again.
This is the worst case of hives I've ever had.
I'm here for three nights, it's an AirBnB.
So, can I take you out for a coffee or are you gonna leave me hanging?
Honey it's probably not a good idea for you to come in wearing that floral print.
When you said 'buzz off,' I took you literally.
It's roomier than it looks.
I just think something like "sweetie" might be less confusing.
I told you I'm a W.A.S.P.; don't be a buzzkill.
It's in my price range and they allow pets.
Go ahead, punch me!
It's my new concept -- Air Bee & Bee.
Well, your profile had just a head shot too.
Avoiding you? Yes.
You wouldn't happen to have a smoke, would you?
Don't you 'honey' me!
The birds I get. It's the bees I'm still working on.
When the fairy asked me, "To bee or not to bee," I didn't thoroughly understand the question.
Just...looking for my comb, honey.
There's a real hive mentality here.
Even in my dreams, I was always the Queen.
They made me a better offer.
Do you have anything with black and yellow horizontal stripes? It's pretty important.
All I am saying is give bees a chance.
I crave a different kind of buzz.
This may sting a little.
You know how people say "nothing stings like the truth?" Well, they're wrong.
She treats me like a king.
It’s supposed to be better than acupuncture.
Because it's on a quiet, tree-lined street, and it's rent-controlled.
But the good news is that I found my wallet.
I told you not to book online.
I know, I thought Bumble was just your average dating app too.
You are taller than you look in your profile pictures
I realize now that I should have asked a few more questions before saying I’d be willing to role play.
Well, my ad did say you'd be dating a WASP.
I'm in witness protection.
Also, bees don't have knees. Who knew.
I'm not in a cult; I'm in a colony.
Oh, and I suppose YOUR online profile is 100% true?
The doctor said not to worry, it's only hives.
It's cheaper than acupuncture.
No, you beehave.
Well, your online dating profile was a little misleading too!
I got caught up in all the buzz.
I had to see what all the buzz was about.
We might as well embrace our WASP heritage.
It's small, but my roommates do all of the housework.
Having hundreds of workers report to me directly is going to really help me develop senior management skills.
Look, I know you're getting tired of just hanging out, but hanging out is what I do.
None of your beeswax.
They give me a buzz.
I wasn't joking when I said I come from a WASPy family
Yes, I'm the head beekeeper. How may I be of assistance?
To bee or not to bee - I finally answered the question!
I said behave honey, not beehive!
Free waxing for life
They're planning something for the bear.
Sorry, the queen will not see you today.
They want one thousand pounds of honey in small jars delivered here by tomorrow night, or they said you'll never see me again.
What did you think I meant when I said I was buzzed?
I found it on Airbnbee.
They understand me here.
Well, you said you wanted to marry a WASP!
A piñata I'm not.
CAN YOU SCRATCH MY NOSE ?
I think I found Jimmy Hoffa.
Would you like to be pollinated?
I misspelled Airbnb.
One minute, I'll see if he's here.
It's not as sweet of a location as you would think.
Can I go back to the doghouse?
The bees won't be a problem, will they?
Say she's not the fairest of them all? Fine. Bounce one rent check at Magic Mirror On The Wall? This.
It's a lot roomier inside than you would think.
Yeah, maybe I am a little too deep into this backyard bee thing.
I got the bees part nailed, next it's the birds.
Your preference said SWM WASP.
Honestly, I'm happier here.
Oh… I thought you said honey beehive yourself.
You say drone like it's a bad thing.
You seem to be closing off in our relationship.
At least they accept me for who I am.
I come from a long line of WASPs.
Honey, the queen and I are just friends.
I will grant you three wishes, but they have to be about bees.
If he can be president, why can't I be queen bee?
shhh, I'm playing hide and seek with the kids.
...and I'm Burt.
To Bee or Not to Bee was the question... I chose to Bee.
Does "farm to table" mean nothing to you anymore?
Hey Honey, I've been looking everywhere for you
It's QUEEN Larry, now.
A stinging reply is not funny!
You can't convince them you're the queen.
"Look on page three of the Beekeepers instruction manual for me quick"!
'It's my new mancave.'
You should update your profile picture.
Stop referring to it as a cult, Charlotte.
It's not that bad, just a little buzzing in my ears.
I know you also call me "honey", but they mean it.
The drone in here is almost unbearable.
I thought you should know that I'm bee-sexual
I am not crazy. My reality is just different than yours
You kicked me out. They took me in. End of story.
My hive, my rules. No girls allowed.
Buzz off Brenda.
Why do you always assume it's my fault?
It's the only 1 BR we can afford in this neighborhood.
I SAID...It's NONE of your Beeswax!
So what, I'm just a drone. But I don't have to work, they feed me, and I have relations with the queen at my leisure. Your move honey.
Selfless cooperation, brilliant symmetrical designs, and all the honey I can eat. That's why.
Oh, I see, you actually said behave.
I've put up with your droning for years.
The queen in this house doesn't yell at me.
Are you sure your parents don't mind you dating a wasp?
"Don't be a buzz kill, Beatrice".
My mother left, you can come out now
Marry me and you'll live like a queen.
Because they think I'm cool, that's why.
No, I have found another queen!
You and your stinging wit. 'Behive yourself, honey!' And now this!
You'd prefer a toad?
Did you bring the EpiPen?
Where did you think WASPS came from?
They call me the bee whisperer.
We'll be safe from the immigrants in here. The wasps will never let them in the neighbourhood.
So you say I can't be the Queen Bee. Now who's being sexist?
I always wanted to be queen.
Would you rather I were a corporate drone?
I found this place on Air BeeNBee
Does this mean you can't pick up the kids?
I'm embracing my WASP heritage.
Kissing a frog seemed a bit cliche.
The queen is in. May I ask who's calling?
She makes me feel like a king.
It's small but the rent's good
Nelson, come down from there! I think that you're taking this Citizen Scientist hobby a bit too far.
Talk louder. I can't hear you over the buzz.
It probably IS the peyote talking, but we should still totally make out.
so I guess you do have bees in your bonnet after all
Beheaded. Bee-headed. Either way it's a very serious condition
Your profile said you were looking for a man who was a little dangerous.
Been a tough couple of weeks, frankly.
Can you stop calling me honey...
Now it's your turn to hide.
I do love you. I just don't feel ready to move in together.
Do not ask for whom the bee buzzes; it buzzes for thee.
I come from a long line of New England wasps.
Of course I'm not cross-pollinating!
At 2400$ a month this B Loft is priced to move!!
We both know how this ends.
We overthrew the Queen
The queen's busy – can I take a message?
I feel right at home with the drones.
I've had enough... honey.
There are times in our marriage when I need to be a drone.
To bee or not to bee? That is my question.
Oh, this? It's just a mild case of hives.
Welcome to my manhive.
Let me guess; you're allergic.
What do you mean Winnie the Pooh is not real?
Okay, yeah, I'm a little buzzed.
Honey, there's something hive been meaning to tell you
I self-identify as their queen.
Now let's go find a nest and I'll teach you about the birds.
I've fallen in love with the Queen.
Remember when you said ... for better or worse.
Please let me bee.
They understand me.
Sure I'm a bit conservative. But waspy?
Yes, I had told you that you'd always be my queen, but I have moved on.
When I told you I was a wasp, I meant it literally.
Have your parents left yet?
Let me guess, you're wondering where the rest of my body is.
Wasp's up?
This is how Jane Goodall started.
I know it stings, but I'm finally where I beelong.
Pardon my reticence. I've been stung before.
It's not bad for New York, I only have 2 million roommates.
Go ahead then, slap me. I dare ya!
None of your beeswax.
Our plan is working - they don't suspect a thing.
If you must know, I'm involved in a sting operation.
I know its small, but we can actually afford it!
Well then don't swipe right before seeing the full body pic.
Come on, big hug.
Well, now you know...
You're right. I never should have left the Huff Post for Buzzfeed.
Nice knees!
Take me down, Helen. Now I’ve got to learn about the birds.
Once I knew about the birds, I just had to find out about the bees.
I'm sorry, but your profile picture is a bit misleading.
Actually they're hornets.
Bee headed? It's better than beheaded.
Jeez Sharon, why is everything I want to do with you dumb or stupid or deeply unsettling and physically impossible?
It's less stressful than the office...
Now you tell me about the birds.
It's none of your beeswax where I've been.
... and then I asked myself: "To bee or not to bee?"
Let me know when your mother leaves.
They made me their queen.
I gave up the bottle like you asked, but I just can't give up the buzz.
Yes Helen, I finally solved my gender issues, I am the Queen.
There's no place like comb.
It's much roomier on the inside.
Didn't you read my dating profile? It said, 'WASP male, seeking single WASP female.'
What is it? We're very busy.
Yes, that is the question.
It's a little crowded, but all in all, it's actually quite sweet.
I'm in advertising.
I just needed some bee time.
I'm only two kisses away from becoming Prince Charming.
Take a chance on me...I'm a keeper.
Hello. I'm Burt.
It meant nothing! You're my true queen.
I'm going to be a bit late tonight. The queen's in one of her moods again.
The Queen will see you now.
I think I took your honey-do list too seriously.
I just want to see what all the buzz is about.
There's nothing anti-Semitic about it—I just prefer wasps.
What about my Tinder profile is misleading, exactly?
Why don't you buzz off.
Yes, as a matter of fact, I am a wasp!
C'mon, honey. You always knew I was a WASP.
And then I get this continuous buzzing in my ears....
The good news is, my back doesn't hurt anymore.
My genetic test says I'm actually a wasp.
Doesn't get more organic than this.
I hate heights, the bees won't listen, and winter is brutal— but, I have weekends off, and I am my own boss.
Oh, busy. And you?
I just wanted to see what all the buzz was about.
Considering the proximity to Central Park, the rent isn't so bad.
This is the 'for worse' part.
I don’t know maybe 'slightly' buzzed.
I had to see what all the buzz was about.
I was seeing what all the buzz was about."
I'll tell you who appreciates me Jill; they do!
It's the newest thing: a man hive.
Oh... I always thought it was, "Bee all you can bee."
This place gives me hives.
Can I go in the doghouse now?
There's no way to sugarcoat this.
I prayed that I'd come back as a W.A.S.P.
It's on the smaller side, but a great place to raise thousands of children.
Just back off. I never lied to you about being a WASP.
It started as a casual hello to the queen as she flew by.
It's bigger on the inside.
But you're probably tired of hearing about my larvae - what's happening with you?
Yes, your online profile said you were sweet and a real keeper...but somehow I pictured you differently.
Don't take this personally, but I'm not sure I'm ready to move in together yet.
Because she treats me like a king, Bernice.
This is still better than having dinner with your mother
Can't talk. I'm busy.
I'm their queen now.
I'm sorry, honey, but I'm transitioning into a queen.
Do you hear a buzzing?
Could you please bring me my yellow jacket?
At this point, I'd rather live under a monarchy.
But enough about bees...
It's not what it looks like. She means nothing to me.
Sorry, but I've always wanted to be a queen.
Busy?, my foot! They're all sitting around drinking pina coladas!
Actually I found it on Airbnb.
I just wanted to see what the buzz is all about.
Internship at Buzzfeed
Not now Honey, I'm buzzy.
Remember that problem I told you I have with hives.
I should probably update my profile photo.
Dont worry, I'm just Queen for a day.
"Not to bee", that's the answer!
The sarcasm stings , but it feels authentic when they call me, "Honey."
I would treat you like a queen.
You told me to buzz off.
I just like my honey to be locally sourced, that's all.
This is my home. I was adopted.
Boy! I've never seen the housing market this tight!
The buzzing helps me relax.
They made me their king.
Mr. Spicer, it's really time that we faced the media.
Sorry honey, my phone was on vibrate.
Thanks, but I'm not sure "going the piñata route" is the best solution here.
I like the sense of community here.
I did say I come from a family of Wasps.
Well, the queen is a bit bossy, but hey...free honey!
"Not to bee", that's the answer!
That's the question I keep asking myself.
Come on in and we can pollinate.
Manhive.
No, you misunderstood. I said you need to behave yourself!
Before you come in, there's something I should tell you: my family is a bit... different.
Behave? I thought you asked me to beehive.
"Believe me, the honey tastes better when you get it directly from the hive".
'To bee or not to bee''. That must be the question.
They want the ransom paid in honey.
Look at it this way: If you're the nesting type, I'm your guy.
I've been busy as a bee...you?
It's called Air Bee and Bee.
Oh! I thought you said beeHIVE yourself.
It's a really bad case of hives.
Oh. When you said queen, I assumed you meant drag.
I'll need you to buzz me in.
A bit of appreciation would be nice. I've been working on this "Hi Honey" gag all day!
You can come out now. My mother left.
If you don't bother them, they won't sting you.
It's the only authentic way to consume honey.
The bees are fake news.
You do have to admit that I, at least look like my profile picture.
Considering the severity of your bee stings, our relationship appears to be doomed.
I said the doghouse.
'Somehow I went from being a drone to a queen.'
At home, I'm merely your stay-at-home husband. In here, I'm the queen.
Please, spare me the I-told-you-so.
Emily was trying one of the new dating apps...
It's a new form of meditation in which you focus on beeing.
Honey it's swarm in here.
So what's all the buzz?
White Anglo-Saxon Protestant. How about you?
They've finally accepted me as one of their own
I like to think of myself as being the Jane Goodall of bees
It's the latest in Airbnbees.
To bee or not to bee is my question.
It's a totally different experience from what you would imagine.
At least they accept me as who I am, Diane.
No. I'm not mad. Why?
And stop calling me "Honey."
Sorry, I'm busy.
' I'm downsizing.'
At least THIS Queen appreciates me!
Guess what? I'm not allergic anymore!
I've not a fear of commitment as much as a colony collapse disorder.
Wait, you said "behave"?
I said I wouldn't get drunk. I never said I wouldn't get buzzed.
We just gotta stop meeting like this...and not crazy about those shoes...
Yes, I do have a far above average size head for a hornet.
I told you I was busy
It's not you, it's me. Definitely me.
You'll always be my queen.
Well, did you find my EpiPen?
I know the bugger who stung me is in here somewhere.
"Honey" means different things to different people.
It's a long story.
The honey-making is really the only tricky part.
Yes, there is a King Bee.
If you find yourself at a drugstore pick up some calamine lotion.
Sorry Alice, I'm not the Cheshire Cat---buzz off.
So, it's true. Your mother is a witch.
Could I give you a buzz sometime?
Is this 'bad boy' enough for you?
Now you know the truth... I'm a Drag Queen.
It's definitely easier to get into than out of...
Her majesty will see you now
Perhaps I owe you an explanation.
I call it 'Plan Bee.'
I really like being licked by bears
It's an air bee and bee
It's none of your bees' wax, that's what!
I remember when the dog house was enough.
I'm just checking to see they comply with their "Certified Organic" designation.
What can I say? She just gets me.
My doctor says it's the worst case of hives that s he has ever seen.
You've never heard of Kafka?
I am minding my own beeswax
I know you can't stand my mother but she's only staying with us for one week, for God's sake!
I'm pretty buzzed.
The doghouse was better.
I told you I was madder than a hornet.
I can't talk now, Lydia. The Queen awaits.
This is the last time I stay at an AirBeeNBee.
Well for one, my tinnitus is gone.
Well, my profile did say I was in upper management at a multi-level organization.
The ad did say that side-effects may include hives.
I'm busy.
I thought you said 'Show me the honey.'
The hive mind approves of those shoes with that dress.
This might be bad timing but could you put a little sunscreen on my nose?
It was a laboratory experiment to save the Bees that went terribly wrong.
Your profile said you were a WASP.
Nah, I ain't complaining-- it just sorta defeats the purpose of witness protection.
So now they have a KING.
You're the bee's knees! I'm the bee's face!
I couldn't resist the lure of the hive mind.
I'm searching for my inner beeing
Haven't you always wanted to be queen for a day?
We should talk to the realtor again about our minimum requirements.
It just seems like whenever I let someone get close, they get hurt.
My torso is in an anthill.
Why do you think I'm avoiding you?
It's an Airbnb.
"Just don't call me honey".
Actually getting in here was the easy part....
What did you expect when you married a W.A.S.P.?
They started at my feet; so I guess this is goodbye my love.
I decided I would rather be close to Mother Nature than your mother.
Just be careful what you say at the press briefings is all l,m saying !
What can I say? I like being part of a community.
Honey, this is about self-transformation
It's not you, it's the bees.
Are you sure that this is the best the Witness Protection Program can come up with?
I'm not coming out until you call me "honey"
Your floral dress is enraging them.
Try killing my buzz now
you got full custody of the kids, our dog every other weekend, the house, our vacation villa and now you want the beehive? I don't think so honey!
Ok, maybe I'm not the best husband, Doris. But how many women can say they're married to the No. 1 ranked Hide-and-Seek player in the world?
Men have a nesting instinct too. Mine's insectual.
Ooooooh! You said "behave?"
Want to hear the latest buzz?
Did you bring the birds?
You just can't believe how busy I've been.
Now we can't go out tonight. You're such a buzzkill.
I told you honey, buzz off!
I'm a keeper.
I just listed the place on AirBee&Bee.
I found it on Air-Be-a-Bee.
I love you too, but it's rent-controlled.
Did you buzz?
They keep telling me it's the worst case of hives they've ever seen.
I decided to bee, rather than not to bee, but I'm not sure that was the best decision.
What's the Buzzword?
I hope our explanation of the birds and the bees comports with a Creationists version of "science".
I thought you told me to buzz off.
You're not as sweet as you look.
It's Trump's new Habitat for Humanity Program.
There is such a sense of belonging. And SHE doesn't judge me.
If it has anything to do with cross-pollination, then yes I can grant your wish.
The queen made me an offer I couldn't refuse.
I'm calling it the secret life of Steve.
Has your mother gone home yet?
I have hives.
Kafka put me here!
Your Bumble profile didn't say anything about a pollen allergy.
No, ouch I'm never ouch coming home ouch and for your ouch information they are not ouch bees, they're ouch hornets.
I don't know if we can be together. You're not a WASP.
First time in an Airbnb?
Of course I can tell you what the buzz is all about.
What does a nice Jewish girl like you see in a WASP like me?
You knew I was a WASP when you married me.
Get the Epipen; they're about to make me their queen!
I would rather put up with these bees for a week than your Mother!!
I'm sorry, but I feel needed here.
I'm sorry, the queen bee position has already been taken.
It's none of your beeswax!
If Trump can be President, I can be Queen.
We think the dress makes you look fat.
Worst piñata ever.
Little help here?!
It'll never work. You're Italian and I'm, well, you know.
What happened to the dog house?
You never wanted to marry a wasp!
They're busy. Would you like to leave a message?
Has your mother left yet?
When you called me 'Honey,' I remember thinking, 'What a bizarre metaphor!'
Either you're with them, or against them.
Still working on that sting operation?
You told me to embrace my inner queen.
You buzzed?
That dress looks ridiculous.
Well, you did tell me to buzz off.
Tell me it's not just about the honey.
Can't you see I'm busy?
Hold on, l think she's upstairs.
Remember “The Fly,” that movie where Jeff Goldblum screwed up a science experiment? Well, I . . . .
It turns out the spells in the Harry Potter books work but you have to get them exactly right.
It's called a sting, Gretchen.
Fine. I’ll switch to agave nectar.
Sorry honey, she's a queen.
What really stings is the HOA fees.
Get me the Benadryl. My hives are back.
Now I know why you only posted a headshot on your dating profile.
White, yes. Anglo Saxon, yes but I'm actually Catholic.
I told you when I left you I needed my space.
I spent last week with the birds.
Believe me, there's been quite a buzz about us around here.
Every year it's harder and harder to be a WASP.
We're both WASP's - I'm just willing to own up to it.
It helps my arthritis.
I think we should pollinate other people.
I do drone on, don't I?
Singularly the worst case of hives the doctor had ever seen.
I've been thinking we should move in together.
I'm generating a lot of buzz
Can I please just go back to sleeping on the couch?
At least I don't have to watch the news anymore.
I'm hivernating.
Honey, I can explain...
Sure, there could be some stinging involved but think of all the free honey.
I feel a swarm of emotions.
Above all, be yourself.
Sorry Judith, I only date WASPS.
Honey, I'm home!
Tell the IRS agent I'm not here!
Mother never told me about those low-hanging fruit !!!
Do you still think I'm a buzz killer?
Now you see what all the buzz is about.
Yes, but I'm saving so much on rent.
You've always known that I hate picnics.
Sorry, I've been busy.
I see you in there with your other honey!
What did you think I meant when I wrote wasp on my profile?
I knew you were a WASP!
Could I interest you in some organic, vegan, gluten, hormone, and antibiotic free honey?
I always hated when you call me honey.
The doctor says I have hives.
My hives are back.
Okay, I confess. I'm a queen.
It sounds worse than it is.
It's roomier than I thought. Let's take it.
You knew I was a WASP when you married me, Consuela.
There's been a lot of buzz around my new tiny house.
Yes, Margaret, this is the source of all buzzwords.
Ummmmmm, you really should have called first.
If you're looking for a drone, I can make myself available.
Don't you dare call me honey
My doctor said it's the worst case of hives he ever saw.
You're such a buzzkill.
And you thought "Alice in Wonderful Land" was scary!
Please tell me you are not The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest.
Before I come down, do you remember where I left the EpiPen?
You don't look like your profile picture either.
I still live with my mother. We all do.
Sorry the queen isn't available can you come back tomorrow?
'I told you, I just don't date WASPS'
I see that you now have Medicare Part Bee coverage.
Given the state of things...I like this society better.
The co-op board is pretty strict, but I think we're in, Muff.
Did you bring my epi-pen?
Just mind your own beeswax.
When I called you honey, who knew you would take it this far?
Yeah, hydrocortisone cream, generic is fine.
Next time, buzz first.
It's less square footage than I was hoping for but the location is great.
It's not as bad as it looks, but that could be the hive mind mentality speaking.
I'm starting to think it's not just in my ears.
Would you like to come up and see my itchings?
After next week in the birds nest, I get my sex ed teaching certificate.
regardless, saying a man can't be the queen seems very sexist to me.
Yeah I know it's small and infested with bees, but it's only $1200 and IN the park.
You don't want to know.
It beats the doghouse. I’m staying.
I'm not like other bees...
Probably a good idea not to call me "Honey"
Don't hang around. It's a sting operation.
There is something I need to tell you. I am a queen.
Every beekeeper I called refused to believe this.
Sure, it looks uncomfortable and awkward, but it is still better than a week with your family.
Does this make me WASPish enough now for your Mother?
Who says I'm not the Queen?
Your knew I was white and protestant, right?
Looks like a man, stings like a bee.
That's no way to speak to the Queen.
Sweetie, you're not listening... they made me—a paralegal from Canarsie—their queen.
The dog house was full.
But I told you I was a WASP when we started dating.
Hive you heard the buzz?
I moved here for the competent female leadership.
Karen, it's true - I live with my parents.
Getting the buzz on was the easy part.
When I read WASP on your profile, I thought it meant something else.
I am NOT afraid of intimacy.
You told me to "buzz off". Can you be more specific next time?
Honey, I love you.
Will you be my keeper?
Warfare ain't what it used to be.
I'd invite you in but I don't want to disturb my roommates.
Best buzz, ever!
But all of my friends' wives let them have manhives.
An empty nest at last.
Top secret sting operation.
Are you now convinced I'm a keeper?
I always called you honey but I didn't think you took me serious.
If Donald Trump can be president, why can't I be the King of bees?
It's surprisingly roomy, the rent's not bad, and the park views are sensational.
You knew I was a WASP when you married me, Consuela.
Please quit calling me "honey."
Did you see my EpiPen®?
Stop searching for imaginary red flags.
It's kind of like acupuncture but cheaper!
Tiny houses are all the buzz these days.
They'll return my torso if we stop eating honey.
Would you rather I have a man cave?
Me? I'm studying sudden bee colony collapse. Why do you ask?
The doghouse was occupied.
It's the getting out that's the hard part.
Apparently a wicked witch does not like to be called honey.
I bought the Queen-for-a-Day package.
The next time we fight I think I'd prefer the doghouse
You don't look like your profile pic.
Yes honey, but do we have any band aids?
'I've got SUCH a buzz on.'
Still trying to fit in?
I know, darling, you're going to have a hard time to explain this to 9-1-1.
As far as I can tell, this is the last refuge for a male WASP.
Don't touch me. I've got a bad case of hives.
To be fair, my profile did say "Wasp."
That medication for chronic hives--get rid of it.
They have free Wi-Fi.
Beats being in the doghouse.
What? Haven't you ever played hive and seek?
Hive been expecting you.
With the hives, it must be an allergic reaction.
It's not you. It's just that I break out in hives whenever we're together.
At least Donald Trump can't reach me here.
Could you scratch my nose?
I've converted.
It's my man hive.
Did you remember the Epi-Pen?
My roommates think you're a bit of a buzzkill.
Not all WASPs are this tightly wrapped
It's 10,000 bedrooms but no bath.
"if you are experiencing depression, thoughts of suicide and if you see you deceased husbands face on a bee hive, stop taking Latuda and call your physician immediately"!
I got 99 problems, and the bees are all of them.
I do Mondays through Wednesdays, the Queen Thursdays through Saturdays. We alternate on Sundays.
Not tonight, my hive's acting up.
I'm not coming home. She makes me feel like a King
Can you call my phone? I can't find it.
You've never called me "Honey."
What?!... I told you I wanted to start making my own honey!
The Lord of the Flies job was taken.
The doctor said it's the worst case of hives they've ever seen.
Honestly, I was just getting honey. I was not flirting with the Queen.
Well, it's a lot more comfortable than living with you.
Your mother thinks I'm too WASPy for you.
I didn't mean that literally, Honey.
An encouraging word, please.
Funny you should ask. I've been busy as a ... well, you know.
It's not what it seems like.
Did your mother leave yet?
Honey, comb your hair.
She made me feel needed.
They elected me their queen.
I think you heard me incorrectly. I said mind your own beeswax honey not mine your own beeswax.
Your still my queen, honest.
I told you this Air Bee-n-Bee had a great view of the park.
If you want to come in, you'll have to take your shoes off.
Bzzt. Over here.
Lower your voice. This is a sting operation.
So in the future, be careful where you set your time-travel coordinates.
I said 'beelzebub' three times in the mirror and this is what happened.
Honey, don't be such a buzz kill.
No, actually I'm Jewish.
What's the Buzz around here you ask
Oh, hi honey...well, this is awkward.
My therapist says this will cure my fear of bees.
I've never had to bring my Epipen on a first date.
Please be more careful with your next magic wish.
Then run away, you always run away
'Money'? I thought you said go out and make some 'honey.'
Do you ever hear buzzing in your ear?
What did you expect? My dating profile clearly said WASP!
You said you wanted fresh and local.
The Queen regrettably must decline your request for an audience, as she currently is meeting with her drones.
I really think our sex therapist is right and this is for the best.
Trust me, it's not what you think.
Yes dear, I understand that your day is going more worse than mine.
On the plus side, I'm the only guy here.
What do you mean I never told you my parents were wasps!?
I self-identify as a wasp.
You do remember that night in bed when you stated that I should wrap myself up in a hobby?
Your mother should be happy, she insisted you marry a WASP.
We do need a queen, if you're interested.
I can explain.
I was looking for the feel of a New York City apartment, but in the country.
Well you said I couldn't have a man cave.
I bee therefore I am.
To bee or not to bee is my question.
Oh, good. I thought it was tinnitus.
Congratulations. You have discovered the original Air Bee N Bee site.
Honey, it's a trap.
The queen just abdicated. What shall I do now?
I prefer, "To bee."
It's a $10 cover to get in, and I need to see a photo ID
This just won't work, Debby. You're Jewish and I'm a WASP.
You can book it via Air Bees N Bees.
I don't have to apologize for being a WASP
Want to hear the latest buzz?
Intimacy gives me hives.
I am with the Queen Bee now.
I'm sorry but we're busy.
Please kiss me so I can turn back into a bee!
What, too WASP-y?
I looking for a missing drone."
Could you call Pooh please.
Birds do it. Bees do it. Even educated fleas do it.
This summer I wanted a style that said, WASP, but not preppy..
Don't be a buzzkill, Mildred.
They're very protective.
Don't look now, but I think they're still following us.
Just when I thought he was retiring, the Man in the Moon signed a contract for another millennium.
The queen doesn't like it when I call you 'honey'
Maybe now you'll believe that I'm a queen.
Before they get rid of healthcare once and for all, I figured I'd get really hurt.
What did you expect from a website for wasps?
Stop acting like you're the queen.
I was bee-headed!
So where did you think I'd go to improve my technique? To the birds?
No, honey. No honey.
I came to visit the queen.
As for my proposal -whatever you decide, please don't leave me hanging.
I miss the doghouse.
I have the hive, not the hives.
I love the low rent and the free honey
As a mater of fact, I do know the words
I'd rather be in the doghouse
The hardest part is fitting into those hexagon-shaped cells.
I didn't make the A-team.
Honey, let me explain.
I bet you call all the guys honey.
That's a WASP - Wild Angry Spouse Piñata
They wanted a king and I couldn't refuse.
But Lois, you're Jewish and I'm a WASP. Think of the children ...
I miss you too honey.
I identify as a bee.
Listen, honey...
It's not you, I've always felt like a bee trapped in a man's body.
you catch more bees with cohabitation.
You get the birds and we can make this work.
Alright, I have the bees. Do you have the birds?
I'll be in in just a bit, hon--the queen has a couple more things for me to do...
Well dear, it's none of your beeswax!
We've got to stop meeting like this. My wife's getting suspicious.
I've always found that flowered dress attractive.
It's not you, it's colony collapse disorder.
I warned all my contacts not to accept a friend request from Jayden K. Smith.
It's not a studio. It's a junior one-bedroom.
Hi, honey. I'm just queen for a day.
This is just something I have to do for myself.
Stop telling the kids I've joined a cult.
See, I told you I would fit.
They stopped looking 4 hours ago!? OK, I guess I win; what's for dinner?
Sorry to drone on and on.
Sure is swarm out today
Plan A didn't work
Honey, can't you just let me bee?
Honey, I am the queen and that dress is so passé
If I had hands, I'd give you a big 'hive-five'!
Have the Willmeirs left?
Stop asking. It's none of your beeswax.
Parking was a nightmare.
Just let me bee.
I finally gave up and joined the other drones.
To bee or not to bee. That was a no brainer.
Not acupuncture. It's call all natural, all pervasive puncture.
The rent is affordable but my roommates will not shut up.
Don't worry, I'll behive myself.
The incessant buzzing is the same, but the rent's cheaper.
Where do you stand on pollination on the first date?
Time's fun when you're having flies.
At least she needs me, Evelyn.
So, are you still seeing Ted?
Will you notice me, now that I'm going extinct?
Came to see what all the buzz is about?
Don't ask. Just find the Beekeeper.
I probably should have mentioned that I have roommates.
I grew up in your typical WASP family.
This is gonna sting, Monica. I'm just not attracted to WASPs.
Do you have any idea how hard it is to get a manufacturing job in this town?
I can't come back yet, they think I'm Queen.
Oh, sure, a WASP slur--like I haven't gotten one of those before.
Do not make any sudden movments
I meant to tell you about Queenie, but then things got out of control.
So I was thinking...why couldn't there be a "king" bee?
The agent says it's the only thing he's got under $3000 a month.
I think I have the hives.
Birds do it. Bees do it. Let's do it—let's join a mutually beneficial collective.
Tell my boss I've had an allergic reaction and broke into hive.
If you're looking for advice lady, you'd better find an owl?
Before you leave, can you just get me out of here?
It's not what you think. I can explain.
You can run, but you can't hive!
You were right. It IS uncomfortable.
How'd you find me?
Because they like me for who I am.
Yaaaaaaaaas, queen.
Busy enough for you?
Well, who`s the Queen now?
Godfrey, darling, but you've always been a WASP.
When you say, "Honey" are you talking to me?
What do you mean, too Waspy?
Can't I just sleep on the couch instead?
It's over, Sarah. I'm seeing someone else
It's supposed to help my allergies.
Because I like to keep busy.
It's un-bee-lievable!
"When I said, 'Be my honey,' didn't expect you go in for a sting operation!'
You may be the Queen out there...
Why didn't you tell me not to do this?
To save the bees, Lois. My life as a piñata was take, take, take. Finally, I'm making a difference.
Their demands are quite reasonable.
I think it is the murphy bed that really makes it work.
You're just one EpiPen shot away from the time of your life, Baby!
You said "buzz off." Happy ?
I've met someone else.
Some women say I drone on too long.
I don't think Trumpcare will cover this
I intended to tell you about my disorder when we first met......but now I feel you are judging me.
Sure, honey, I'll give you a buzz.
It's like a constant ringing in my ears.
When I worry, I get hives.
Did you really think I wouldn't find you?
Sweetheart, you are exposing our undercover operation. I PROMISE to bring home the bread, milk AND some honey.
I'm sorry, it's not you, it's me.
You're such a buzzkill.
It's O K. I'm a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant.
Well we don't have a doghouse...
You did tell me to buzz off.
I think we both know I'm not Catholic.
I'm starting to gain their trust.
Every queen needs a king.
Why such a face Loretta? I've always acknowledged my WASP background.
The thing is, Honey, you're just a debutante. She's a queen.
I've decided to stay.
Are the kids still looking?
Well, my Tinnitus remains, but the buzzing sounds sure beat the ringing in the ears!
They bring me nectar, and I provide structure. All in all, it's not a bad arrangement.
I told you I was going to my manhive.
I just figured I'd join the tiny house craze.
I would say this is more effective than the dog house.
"To do is to bee." -Socrates "To bee is to do." -Sarte "Do-bee-do-bee-do." -Sinatra
Deep down, I don't think I'm qualified either.
I don't recall how I got in here, however the queen has taken a like to me.
Cut me down, baby cakes, and we'll have a blast solving that vanishing bee problem tonight!!
All I hear is buzz, buzz, buzz. And the loudest buzz is about your knobby knees.
Oh really? Have you ever had a meeting with the queen?
We're looking for a new queen.
I want to be your pollinator.
I could fall for you.
But my online dating profile said "wasp" not "WASP".
Can I get a hive five?
For God's sake, Nancy, do something!!
Yes, I know my parents called you a wasp, but they were not be literal!
Sorry, the Queen Bee position has been filled.
is this how you play hive and seek
They've never once complained about my snoring.
Have you seen my keys?
I told you I had a serious case of the hives!
Looks like you've been busy.
You were expecting a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant?
You knew I was a queen when we met.
The price takes some of the sting out of it.
If you love me, a few stings shouldn't bother you.
I'm protesting the bees' matriarchal oppression.
I'm sorry, Jane, but I've met someone more waspy.
"Hive loved you for so long, honey," Marvin droned.
I couldn't turn down the queen!
Here, at least, a queen gets the respect he deserves.
jason quickly realized that he should have followed the rabbit into the rabbit hole and not followed the bee.
Wasps, Mary! The bee thing was years ago.
Charles, please come home! You can "Just Be" there.
Kiss me and I'm free!
The accommodations are tight, but my sore throat is much better.
No, I'm not a piñata.
You married a WASP, what do you expect?
It’s one of the last rent-controlled units.
Are your parents leaving soon?
Jim, I never realized you were a Protestant.
Sure, it has its downsides, but I married a queen.
The 'hood is so waspy since the rezoning.
It's cozy and I like the neighbourhood buzz.
I knew I should have brought my EpiPen!
Bee Leave
L'etat - c'est moi!
OK, I won't drone on and on in denial--I've got a little buzz going!
Who made you Queen Bee?
I'm not afraid of commitment, l just don't like it when you call me honey"
It just didn't seem like something I could explain in one sentence on Tinder.
Oh, like you're not waspy.
The bees call it "Mekeeping".
Could you please just re-check the EpiPen side effects?
Queen for a day is not all it was cracked up to be.
'Bee mine?' No? How about 'wasp up hot stuff?'
Are your parents gone yet?
The genomic testing confirmed that my family tree is 93% WASP.
Yes, I promise, I'll turn into a Prince
It lacks a human element.
Then why didn't you mention these "allergies" in your profile?
Grew tired of the crew cut. Going with the beehive.
I'm interested in a pollinatemous relationship.
If you'd just gotten rid of it when I asked, you'd never have found yourself in this position!
My profile pictures were not 100% accurate.
It's not ideal-but now you won't be tempted to move back in.
I'm leaving you...the Queen and I are in love.
I really feel part of something now.
Sorry about the stinging remarks.
It'll never work out between us, Sophie. You're Jewish and I'm a wasp.
Come on! How did you find me?
It's the only way to get truly cruelty-free honey.
Can your precious Lawrence do this?
I told you my family was a bit waspy.
I think the bees suspect something.
I've taken local honey to the next level.
If you've got the birds, I've got the bees.
Let me know when you're Mother-in-leaves. I'm safe here.
I now think I should have chosen not to bee.
Just kiss me already, I promise it’ll only sting for a minute. Trust me, you’ll be glad you swiped right!
Besides hives, what other symptoms do you have?
Miriam, can't we look past the fact I'm a WASP?
Tell me, what's the buzz on social media?
To save the bees, Margaret, we must become one with the bees!
I told you I was the best Hide-and-seek player in the world.
That one stings.
I can't leave now, I've been elected Queen!
Do you see now what all the buzz is about?
I never once mated with the Queen, we are just good friends
They made me their king, but it turns out it's mostly ceremonial.
How'd you find me?
You know me, always after a bigger buzz.
Did you really think this was getting you out of doing the dishes?
Rent stabilized? If only.
They said they needed a king.
I need less space.
There may be certain issues in dating me.
Well, you wouldn't let me have my man cave.
Of course I will turn into a prince. What’s the risk of one little kiss?
Do I look like my photo?
Yes, it's very fresh, very local.
Doctor, I'm breaking out in hives!
I read about it on Goop.
My mother told me marrying a wasp would never work.
They sting less ...
What a day! I've been busy as a ... well, you know.
The realtor assured me this was the best I could do without rent control.
I'm your brother's beekeeper.
Well, they don't sting family.
Well, Carl, I see your wish has been granted. You always wanted to be king bee!
Listen more carefully, I said I'm IN a hornet nest ... not you're a WHORE.
Their life isn't really that secret!
I'm not going to drone on and on about how this happened.
You thought I meant, 'white Anglo-Saxon protestant?'
It’s not you; it’s me.
So, it's you!
I have an audience with the Queen
It's a lot better than that damn jar...
This was cheapest place to live in San Francisco.
Did you bring my insulin?
You knew when you married me I was a WASP.
It's a little awkward. Not only is our apartment rather cramped, I have 5,000 fathers-in-law.
Sorry, the queen appreciates me and is much sweeter!
They made me their queen. And no, I won't abdicate.
Protestant, why do you ask?
I was hoping to break this to you slowly
I can't get the buzzing out of my head.
I still love you, I just need to bee by myself right now.
How much do I need to get?
Surely there are easier ways to come out as a queen
Oh, they won't let us call it "artisanal" anymore unless we help build the combs.
Don't be mad, darling, I finally found my queen.
The buzz in here drowns out the ringing in my ears
I'm not sure if the immunotherapy is working, but my claustrophobia has disappeared.
So who's Queen Bee now, Honey?" "I could hang here making puns all day!" "Wait...... I think I'm breaking into hives.
Well, you told me to go hang out with the other WASPs.
I've decided to put into practice the old analogy about caterpillar/butterfly transformation.
It's true about the honey, but I can't remember why I wanted to catch more flies in the first place.
What?? I told you my family was waspy.
Did you bring your EpiPen ?
Sorry - you'll never believe what my ringtone is set on.
A toasted English muffin would be nice.
Now that you mention it, I guess it is kind of a waspy neighborhood.
How do you feel about cross-pollination?
I would introduce you, but it might make us late.
I feel like we've grown apart.
I get it! Now stop calling me "honey"!
Trust me. My honey is better than any you've ever tasted!
Honestly, I feel safer in here.
Well, if you didn't take a spa day while I planted the flowers, perhaps the queen would be personally thanking you instead.
For now I'm just consulting, but the buzz is they'll be hiring soon.
I told you I had a lot of roommates, didn't I?
I'm leaving you for the queen.
This is my first Bumble date. Am I doing it right?
Mike, this is getting beyond creepy. It's borderline stalking.
Hi honey, I'm comb.
Now will you believe me when I say buzz off?
Will you please stop calling me "honey!"
But, frankly, I can only give it three stars.
At least my current queen is slightly less bossy than you were.
The doctor tells me it's the worst case of hives he's ever seen.
Just give me another fifteen minutes, they're teaching me the Waggle dance.
Welcome! Let me buzz you in.
Don't you ever call me a wannabee again!
Turns out the Queen Bee can be very persuasive.
Just like the Airbnb ad said. Buzzing with rustic charm.
Well, my mother said I was I keeper.
I am the lesser known King Bee.
This Queen likes the way I load the dishwasher.
Not fair! You didn't count to twenty!!
It's surprisingly more spacious than my last apartment but the buzzing is killing me.
I meant let me be
There you go, always droning on
You knew the challenges when you married a wasp.
Were you never taught about the nerds and the bees?
Give me a buzz later. Can't you see I'm busy?
I guess when the queen said, "Off with your head", she really meant it.
I think what you mean is, 'This is un-bee-lievable.'
Well thanks, but what makes you think I'm qualified to be a Presidential spokesman?
My Tinder profile clearly states that I am a WASP.
Actually, this is my first time to book a place through Air Bee-n-Bee
I thought you said the bees knees.
You said you wanted locally sourced honey, dear.
On second thought, let me just tell you about the birds.
You go ahead. I'm going to be a little late.
John, it appears the bees ARE your bonnet.
The funny thing is - I didn't even get the short straw!
Ok, you found me. Now it's your turn!
Well, the secret is out.
The kitchen's a bit small, but the rent's right.
I'm taking a break from politics.
Worst case of hives the doctor had ever seen.
I thought you meant White Anglo Saxon Protestant.
This time of year I always get hives.
I love your dress.
Tell me something I didn't already know.
Air Bee&Bee
Oh, keeping busy. How about you?
It's rent-controlled.
I just couldn't bee myself around you.
Let's face it, honey.
I'm hiding from the sting of reality
Honey, I need some space.
Do it again and you're in the dog house!
Look, it's near the park, close to work and at $1500 a month I love it.
A bee, or not a bee, that is the question.
To bee or not to bee was probably the wrong question.
Finished the honey do list.
I told you was a WASP when we met online.
Perhaps you recognize me from my starring role in "Swarm."
I think I can handle the claustrophobia. But we gotta get a new term of endearment besides 'Honey.'
Leave now. They want to pollinate.
Fine. I'll admit this was a stupid idea.
You think it's easy being a WASP these days?
Have you seen my EpiPen?
Last Week it was the Birds- This week the Bees- I'll see you Friday night.
Home, I'm honey!
I am their father.
My day? Just the usual.
Sure, there's not a lot of closet space... but a Central Park view for under 4 grand a month? You can't beat it!
I'm throwing a surprise birthday party for Winnie the Pooh.
I have an audience with the Queen
Be honest. How do I look?
Sorry honey, I've left you for the queen bee.
If our relationship is going to move forward, there is something I need to tell you ...
I know you're Catholic, but we can make it work!
'There's a lot of buzz about this neighborhood.'
No problem, it happens all the time. He’s in apartment B, you buzzed apartment Bee.
Still less painful than Trumpcare.
I got all twisted up in the hammock, and next thing you know--they've made me their queen
These reality show dating challenges keep getting weirder and weirder.
Okay, Gladys, that last item on the honey-do list pushed me over the top.
Over hives?! Your eczema isn't so sexy either.
Honey, will you bee mine?
You want to be the birds, honey?
They've chosen me as their king.
But you told me to mind my own beeswax.
Sorry I haven't called. I've been busy.
Trust me. This is safer than going in to work today.
If it's what you say I love it.
So, for the last time. Will you bee mine?
I figured out the buzzing in my ears....
Give me a buzz sometime
You're still my queen.
I thought we were playing hive and go seek.
Oh dear... you have been bee-headed!
Wanna play birds and bees?
I thought the snake thing had been done to death.
Come on. Give it a try.
Sorry. I have a tendency to drone on.
Well, for starters, when she calls me 'honey,' she means it.
I need to get back to work.
White, Anglo-Saxon Protestant. Why do you ask?
Farm-To-Table take too long!
Don't think I'll make it to dinner, honey. I'm cured of my bee phobia but still need to work on my claustrophobia.
Bees? Fake news.
Yes, I'm a WASP. Don't judge me.
I'm trying to tap into the hive mind.
My profile clearly said wasp.
So now you see why I couldn't call you back?
Sometimes hallucinogens come with a small price to pay afterwards. Now kiss me.
Burt, is that you?
My, what a VERY attractive dress you're wearing.
Whole Foods makes me get the freshest honey possible
I figure the best way to save the bees is to become one with the bees.
She's a Queen, Doris...a Queen.
... but they have good health insurance.
I swatted the head drone so they put me in here.
Now that Trump is president, I had to take saving the bees into my own hands.
Are you an introvert, too?
Buzz off, woman!
Come on in, everyone gets equal pay for equal work in here
Go ahead and buzz yourself in.
Well, I never actually said, "white Anglo-Saxon Protestant."
Perhaps you were expecting a Cheshire Cat?
Their queen kidnapped my drone.
Tom's breakup speech to Mary really stung.
just hanging out,what's new with you?
A queen needs her king.
NOW can you see what the buzz is about?
I know...I can run, but I can't hive.
Hilda, will you marry me?
Have you seen my comb?
What's in your bonnet?
I've been hearing some buzz that you're seeing someone else.
I thought you said 'hive and seek.'
Do you have a moment to talk about our savior?
You can't hear the buzzing from in here
Let me tell ya 'bout the birds and the bees and the flowers and the trees and the...OW!
Peek-a-boo. I bee you.
It was advertised on Airbnb as "a weekend getaway in the Hamptons".
Well, I told the genie one of my wishes was to float like a butterfly and sting like a bee.
You told me i was sturring up a hornet's nest and to beehive myself!
Remember when you told me to buzz off?
Wait. I thought you said 'hive' and seek?
It's actually a lot roomier than it looks.
I'm right ! There are bees in here.
It's not as bad as reading about Trump.
I've always loved you, honey.
I got kicked out of the doghouse!
Behave? I must have misheard...
Please, please . . . I'm begging you. Stop calling me Honey.
You told me to bee myself.
I've chosen metaphor over commitment.
I admit it. I'm cheating on you with The Queen.
To bee, or not to bee.
Remember how you wished for bee-stung lips?
I didn't say my house was a "dive". I said "hive"!
It's advertised on AirBnB as a way to get in touch with your wasp roots.
'To bee or not too bee?'--I had to explore my options.
The WASP in me honors the WASP in you.
As an added plus, the hive has free Wi-Fi.
Sure, it's not the biggest shared office, but the work ethic in here is really motivating
Sorry honey, I am declaring myself bee-sexual and that's all there is to it.
I keep breaking out in hives.
It's all organic.
I only wanted a little buzz.
Bad news. I thought it was the bees, but the doc says I have tinnitus.
you wanna come in for a bit? my roommates are out right now.
The queens are gender neutral now.
What did you think I meant by WASP?
Honey, my mother will only be in town two more days.
It helps my allergies.
Could you find me a pair of pants?
I'd like to see you kick me when I'm down now, Brenda.
This isn't exactly what I wished for.
The latest buzz is that he can't possibly do the full term.
I see you're finally working on that Honey-do list.
Why would you think I'm colluding with them?
I've found another queen to serve, Mabel.
Yes, but it's rent-controlled.
It's called immersion entomology.
Perhaps my drive for minimalism has gone too far.
You don't resemble your Tinder photo at all.
I could never be myself with you.
Just call me 'Honey'
Please don't call me honey.
Found it on Air-bee-nb
They wouldn't call it a sundress.
Shall I pick up some antibiotics for the hives?
I can't marry you, Bob, we're just too different.
I've broken out in hive.
Look me in the hive and tell me you don't love me...
I just wanted to find out what all the buzz was about.
Why? None of your beeswax!
I've been meaning to tell you about me and the Queen.
I was led to believe there would be birds, too.
No Honey. Neither hornet nor bumble! I'm a WASP.
OK Honey, I'm sorry I called you a witch.
Do you like my new man bun?
Come and be my queen.
I'm sorry to tell you that the Queen and I have just eloped.
I could use a buzz.
I wear my yomacfa so they know I'm not a Wasp
...but honey, they're our kind of people...White...Anglo Saxon...Protestant....
Couldn't you just put me in the doghouse?
You said, "BEHAVE?"
I think I figured out what the buzz is all about.
I told you I was a WASP on our first date; remember?
You said you'd leave me if I didn't get us more honey.
It has a sweet view of the park.
Why can't you just let me be?
The bigger question is, how do I get out?
The Queen and I have an understanding
I got it on airbnbee
Oh, you said beHAVE
No, it's not a bonnet.
This isn't what I expected when I signed up for Bumble.
It's not so bad here, the rent is cheap and lots of free food!
Just hanging out. You?
I don't care what you say. In our relationship, I'm the Queen bee.
For honey, Honey.
I can't, they made me Queen.
Just wait till we get to the birds.
Believe me when I tell you.
The folks from "Tiny House" failed to mention the roommate situation.
Do you hear that hum or is it just me?
Getting in touch with my inner WASP.
Turns out, it's nothing but work, work, work!
For once, I wanted to be the queen bee.
I am sick of dating WASPs
Can't you see that I'm busy?
I don't know my family will react. I never brought home a Jewish girl before.
Two words - comb honey.
I actually found some honey in the fridge, thanks anyway though.
Well I found out what all the buzz was about.
Hive grown accustomed to your face.
If I'm ok with you being Jewish, why can't you accept that I'm a WASP?
It will only be 3 and half more years, honey.
I wanted to what "the buzz" was all about.
This conversation is making me uncomfortable.
Oh, there you are. Do you think this dress makes me look fat?
I'm Anne Bolyn .. bee headed awhile ago .
You're still my queen.
Bee with me.
Can't you see I'm busy?
Just mind your own beeswax.
Couldn't I just sleep on the sofa or in the doghouse?
They respect my space. I'm hung but never stung.
Hold on, I'll buzz you up.
I'm sorry honey, but the place looked bigger on AirBeeNBee.
I hate to say it, but you were right.
They brought back the TV show 'Queen For A Day'. And I won!
My summer home is in the Hamptons.
What? So now you don't like outdoorsy guys?
Now all we need is the birds.
This is good-bye, Denise. The queen and I have ... ouch! ... something special.
Don't worry—it's organic.
Did you borrow my comb, honey?
Are you telling me to buzz off?
I'm in the MIDDLE of a sting operation.
KGB
...and then tell Spock to throw Mr Scott in the brig.
Not until you call me Honey.
Buzz
Are you ready to bumble?
My hives are acting up.
You're very sweet, but the answer is No.
Help! I've fallen into a wasp's nest and I can't get out!
Yes, I did get your text but did you forget I really can't text you back.
So I did buzz off.
"Not to be" was never really an option.
I've moved on to Plan B
You've really gone method for your stinging rebuke, haven't you?
I was looking for my yellow jacket.
I don't know. How did any of us get here?
A bee in my bonnet? No, quite the reverse!
I told the genie, I wanted to be good in the sack.
I look on them as pets
We met on Bee-Harmony.
Smaller than we're looking for, and way too busy.
Ok, you've pulled yourself together, but you still have a bee in your bonnet.
If you can't beat 'em...
I have been very busy lately.
Honey, Freud would say the hornets nest is a metaphor for our relationship and the absence of my body indicates you are dreaming
I thought you were joking when you said you lived in wasp neighborhood.
It's not what it looks like.
You told me I need to learn more about the birds and the bees.
Yes - as in White Anglo Saxon Protestant
Now you know what the buzz is all about.
You're sending me mixed messages. First you told me I'm the bees knees and now you're telling me to buzz off.
Another Tinder fail.
Well, too bad! We don't HAVE a dog house!
No, keep the ring.
On the other hand, I never did figure out the birds.
Well, their interpretation of bee-keeping is not the same as yours or mine.
Drone operator. Budget cuts.
Well, I saw it as a choice between this or nothingness.
The Man in the Moon was already taken.
It looked bigger in the photos on Airbnb.
Yes, I promise to behive myself.
Turns out what they're really looking for is a queen. What do you say?
I used to be a writer.
There are WASPs in your family tree.
I will only come home if you quit bugging me every time I get a little buzz when I have a beer.
Bring me my Epi-Pen.
You can laugh, but the rent is cheap and I've made some new friends.
Yes, honey I remembered to bring my EpiPen
I was told to beehive myself...
It's roomier than it looks from the outside.
Do you really need the definition of WASP?
Yeah, my place is a bit small, but the view is phenomenal...
Is this now a good time to tell you the real story of the 'birds and the bees'?
Sometimes I get a little too absorbed in my hobbies.
It's not what you think.
I DON'T THINK THIS TINY HOUSE CRAZE IS FOR ME
I can say with confidence that the missing bees are not here.
I'm sure you're very sweet, but it'll never work out.
Yes, Dorothy, I am the Great and Powerful Buzz.
Find my wife. Tell her the correct answer is "not to bee" and hurry please.
It won't work between us? What am I missing?
You did say you wanted to put down roots
Don't be alarmed, but there's a bee on your lip.
Yes, I quit my job, but now I have thousands working for ME.
Hello, I'm the resident WASP.
No room here, this is strictly a WASP neighborhood.
Honey,get me my epi pen.
You kept calling me honey and look what happened.
Oh, same old thing. What have you been up to?
I wish we still had the dog house.
My new hobby has already consumed me
Bees are dying and I'm a nihilist.
Here's another fine nest you've gotten me into.
I am minding my own beeswax
I'll come back inside in a minute. I just needed a little bee time.
It's the price of epi-pins, isn't it?
I told you to move the nest - not move into it!
"But it'll never work. I'm old money, I vote Republican, and I'll sting you the first chance I get".
I told you I was a WASP when we met.
So then I rubbed the lamp and wished I was head of all the workers.
Before we call it quits could we try the marriage counsler one more time?
Oh, just listen to me drone on. What about you? How many thousands of siblings do you have?
It is less stinging than your critique!
I don't think we can wait for a pest professional.
I thought you told me to beehive.
I don't know what it is about today, I just feel so a-hive!
What did you think I meant by "beekeeper"?
We can't go on meeting like this.
I know, I look taller in my profile picture
Just taking my 'droning on and on' to the next level.
Hang in there, honey.
Don't leave me hangin
I told you I've been busy.
I just want to bee myself, Jessica.
Call Dr. Katz and tell him the hives have gotten worse...
Kiss me and bee my Queen
I'll come out when I'm ready, OK?
I think they want me to be their Queen.
Somehow the birds got left out of the equation.
You said you would only marry a WASP.
It stands for White Anglo-Saxon Protestant.
Come on! Move in with me, honey.
I already got the talk once; I don't need to hear about the birds and the bees again.
Ethel, please just pay the ransom.
Hornet... Green Hornet.
It's small, but it's priced under market for the neighborhood.
No, we are not paying $500 for an Epipen!
Now you've really stirred up a hornet's nest.
Hive been waiting for you!
Why the surprise. On my dating site bio, I specifically self identified as a WASP
No, you buzz off.
I'd invite you in but my mom is a bit particular when it comes to floral prints
Honey, did we remember the EpiPen?
Tell the kids I'll have the honey and crackers ready in just a moment.
It's a little better than working in a cubicle.
I had to know what all the buzz was about.
Apart from the buzzing, it's pretty good value for the square footage
... and it's rent-controlled!
What? You knew I was a W.A.S.P. when you married me.
These little sticklers made me work my head off !
Is that a pout or a sting?
That really hurt!
Yes, dear. I would prefer to be in the doghouse.
Strawberries always give me hives.
I get it, I should have called the exterminator sooner.
We're out of honey. Can I interest you in one of our other products?
It's symbiotic. They give me honey and I do their taxes.
Hope you don't mind my hive o'clock shadow.
Tiny space, mediocre school district, slight insect problem -- but wow -- take a look at this view.
I told you, Shirley ... I'm running a sting operation.
Stop staring -- I'm trying to blend in.
My preferred pronoun is bee.
I'll miss you, honey.
I tend to break out in hives.
It was either this or fly like a butterfly.
I wanted to see what all the buzz was about.
Just don't ask....
They say it's basically all our fault.
I'm going to need the Epi-Pen, love.
It seemed safer than dealing with the kids.
What I do with other men is none of your beeswax!
Is your mother gone yet?
Now I can drone on all I want and actually be appreciated for it.
Can you hand me my epipen?
Not only did they cut off my head they put it in with all these bees so I'm getting stung like a motherfucker.
I booked it on AirBeeNBee.
Be all you can be
Just hummingly, thanks.
Does this branch look too tight?
Well. Somebody has a bee in his bonnet!
Don't even think about it.
Pardon me, is this the house at Pooh Corner?
Honey, can you grab me the Benadryl?
I thought you said beehive.
Don't wait up - I may bee awhile
It's a studio, park views.
So, I was adopted.
You give me hives.
Tell me about the birds.
It may be cramped, but I can leave the seat up... ANY TIME I WANT!
Not now, I'm busy.
Don't be a buzz kill.
none of your bees-ness
Major career milestone, babes. I'm officially the new face of honey!
I wished you'd behave
I'll be back inside soon...I'm just catching a buzz.
I'm no longer your honey.
When they bend to my will instead of just buzzing around ... That's when we go after Spider Man ...
You were right. It IS good to be queen.
You said you thought I was a keeper.
They invited us on a home tour.
On some level, I think I always knew I was royalty.
I think my tinnitus is gone!
They said I could hang here until we work things out.
Yeah, I guess we may need to call a professional.
Your words sting.
I have a really bad case of the hives!
I have a bad case of hives!
You already told our kids about the birds, right?
Sorry honey, I'll bee working late again.
Buzz is, I'm on inside track for Top Drone.
Next time I'll bring my epi pen so we can talk.
Sometimes dear, I want to be the queen bee.
Actually, for a one-bedroom, it's really quite spacious.
Of course you are still my queen.
I guess the initial attraction was getting hooked up with a real queen.
I'm keeping busy.
Does this hive make my nose look big?
Would you get me some calamine lotion, honey?
Next time I'll just go with the allergy shots.
Susan, am I high or just buzzed?
Just catchin' a buzz . . . why?
Will you be my queen?
You'll never understand. "Back To Nature" is just a joke to you.
We can always tell people we met on Bumble.
Turns out the second B in Airbnb doesn't stand for 'breakfast.'
Store-bought would have sufficed.
But are you REALLY into bee conservation?
Quick, bring me my EpiPen!
I love you. Could you love me?
Try and tell me you didn't feel something after our first kiss!
honey, I ate the queen
I've already got 80,000 followers on FaceHive.
You're the one who said look for a 'tiny house'.
Now who couldn't be more Waspy if he tried!
Its called the "honey comb over"
That's a bad case of the hives.
Honey, it's none of your beeswax, now head home.
Some ladies like waspy guys.
Natalia, are you sure Don Jr's wants a party pinata? It is really, really great. The country really needs this party.
You said you wanted an adventurous outdoorsman.
You just gonna stand there or are you gonna come in and vote?
Yes, we do need a queen. I'll buzz you in.
And I'm allergic to humans.
The circus closing stung more. What's a contortionist to do?
Bee happy, honey.
"I never promised you a Rose Garden.
For this illusion, I used more smoke than mirrors.
I'm sweet for that flower print.
Honey, I think you have hives.
I should be fine for tonight's party, the dermatologist said hives typically last no longer than six hours.
I'm the queen's consort.
You said I should do something buzzworthy.
I said, "I wish I had been born a W.A.S.P., not knowing Genie was such a damned literalist."
Mike, 32 Entrepreneur. "Avid golfer and rock climber. Work hard play hard. Nantucket summers. Alpha Phi Alpha forever!" *sighs and swipes left*
I'm Jewish, but I've always wanted to be a WASP.
How did you get that bee sting lips look?
I'd buzz you in, but ...
Stop calling me "honey".
Still working on your nest egg I see......
I'm getting some great drone footage.
So the "Man on the Moon" is fun, but the "Guy on the Hive" freaks you out?
Honey, have you seen my keys anywhere?
The grocery store honey is perfectly good, Dave.
Just a moment, I'll see if she's in.
The ad just said 'gets to work directly with the Queen.'
Yes, it's true. I'm your birth mother.
$12,000 a month with no utilities but it has park views and good schools.
But I thought you said we should catch a buzz together
On-line, you didn't admit to being a WASP.
Hard to hear you with all the buzzing in my ears, dear.
I don't know all the words, so I'll just hum it.
Please scratch my nose.
Miss, you've got the knees and I've got the bees. Now all we need are the birds.
I got tired of being your pinata.
The inside buzz is he's bored and plans to resign or be impeached within six - eight months, maybe sooner if he can figure how to fabricate CNN's role in either event.
She gets me.
I didn't realize the Genie would take my recitation of Hamlet--"To be or not to be"--as my third wish.
It doesn't always have to be a frog.
I've moved on. I've always wanted a place overlooking the park. Of course, I couldn't afford it without roommates.
I take you've decided to bee.
Yes, I'm a WASP and you're a Jew. So what?
Seriously? You've never dated a WASP before?
They've adopted me as their Queen.
I've been coming out here since you took over the garage.
Well, my mother said I was I keeper.
I used to be the Man in the Moon, but I was downsized.
Okay, you were right. Now get me out of this hornet's nest.
Oh, I don't live here. It's an Airbnb.
I'd invite you in, but I'm really only a guest myself.
Scratch right under my nose.
Good news! We've been upgraded to the honeymoon suite.
I know it's small but it's rent-control.
I came for the honey, but stayed for the sting.
Can you let me bee?
Honey is just a term I often use. I didn't mean to imply intimacy!
We must make love now, before the exterminator arrives...
"My tiny house was just too big".
This may sting a bit
It's small but it is rent controlled
White Anglo-Saxon Protestant, and you?
Except for the buzzing it's very restful.
I'm embracing my WASP heritage.
I'd prefer it if you didn't call me "Honey"
Well, for one thing, it's a lot busier than I expected.
I'll give you a buzz when I'm not so busy.
What's the buzz?
Has your Mom left yet?
Have you heard the buzz about me?
I'm NOT coming back, Sylvia. Life here is too sweet.
It soon became clear that Robert was only interested in Gwen's body, or more specifically the flowers pictured on her dress.
Do you happen to have any anti-inflammatory cream on you?
It's hard being a WASP these days.
Idiot! I said you're a WASP, not a wasp.
Honestly, the farmer's market would be organic enough for me.
I'm thinking of quitting, but the health insurance is phenomenal.
My mother says I don't have to treat you like a queen.
You seem nice, but I only date WASPS.
Can't hear you...my ears are full of honey.
Go ahead, lean in.
They want a car, driver and $100,000 in small bills by 5 o'clock. Oh, and a new publicist. They're tired of this "everything's a hornet's nest" business.
What chores?
You are not my queen.
I'm fine, just trying to keep busy.
NO - I said ' BEHAVE
Say yes before the anaphylaxis
I was singing Let it Be, and then, suddenly, this happened.
I have been researching my family tree and now I know what all the buzz is about
It seemed like a good idea at the time ...
Honey, why can't you just let me bee?
Shakespeare didn’t write “to bee or not to bee.”
Remember when I submitted that entry for "Apian Monthly's" queen for a day contest?
The Doctor says I’ve got hives
Honey, it's not you. It's me.
I'm ready to leave the nest.
This is the worst case of hives I've ever had.
Wait. HIDE and seek??
I'm hearing a lot of buzz about you.
Despite my protests, they made me their queen.
I'm so tired of living the WASP lifestyle.
The stings help me forget how long you take to get ready.
I'm transitioning.
I now consider this my Tiny House.
To tell the truth, it tickles
Are you wearing one of Ivanka Trump's latest dresses?
The Witness Protection Program ain't what it used to be.
I'm waiting here until the recess is over.
There's a real buzz about this place. The guest rooms have a surprising amount of space and the service staff is top notch. I've talked to the queen and she's offering a honey of a deal.
Only if you never call me honey again
Let's play hive and seek.
But, Margaret, when we first met that wondrous day at Yale, I warned you that I was a WASP!
I don't think my mother ever really loved me.
You obviously don't understand the birds and the bees.
I know, I'm not as tempting as the forbidden fruit.
I'd invite you inside, but there's a bit of a travel ban in place for now.
It's not so bad. The honey conveys.
Drones are everywhere.
Who calls it the kiss of death?
I don't know what all the buzz is about.
Admittedly, it's not spacious, but the mortgage payments are surprisingly affordable.
And you don't think your words sting?
Next time you get the honey.
But, honey, I'm trying to be sweeter.
I need you to find Eeyore and Rabbit.
You're not the same person in your Tinder profile.
You said to beehive myself while you were gone.
No,I am the bee keeper
Can we talk about the food truck in the room?
To bee or not to bee - I answered the question.
That's the worst case of hives I've ever sseen
Sure we had some good times but I think I've finally discovered what I am.
Cute, dear, but you still have to take out the trash!
Brace yourself. I'm a Queen.
Admit it Beth, you keep me around just for the honey.
It's not about you.
It's good to be Queen!
Donald Trump is a jackass.
"It's not 'to bee or not to bee'? Damn!
You're right - I am a W. A. S. P.
You think I've gone overboard with bees and I think you spend too much money....we've been over this before....
Nothing else gives me the same buzz.
I'm all for tiny houses. Got wi-fi?
I swear, It's not you, it's me......
I told you we should have gone back to your place.
I am the undisputed best trainer for the 100 yard dash.
When you said on your profile that you were a WASP I was expecting something different.
I'm still not attracted to you.
Ok, I'll ask for directions.
Honey, I've got a bad case of the hives...
Your offer is unacceptable. You'll have to sweeten the deal.
Yeah...I neglected to mention my 106 children in my profile.
Damn right I'm a WASP.
It's time we had that chat about the birds and the bees
Yeah, but the rent is affordable and you can't beat this location.
Please don't ever call me "honey" again.
Don't call me "Ma'am", I'm not the bloody queen.
Not to bee.
You know how when you started scrap booking and I encouraged you to go "all in"?
Wish I could invite you to tonight's event, but the queen says it's guys only.
Please stop calling me honey.
Please don't call me honey right now.
It's called a sting operation.
I still have one more wish.
Doc says I have hives.
Are your parents gone yet?
How come you never call me "Honey" anymore?
Dammit! I told you to get me an epi-pen regardless of the cost.
Who in the hive do you think you are?
What kind of beehivior led to this?
It's a new yoga position, Downward Bumble.
The queen and I are just good friends.
They only serve vodka stingers, but you get used to it.
Because she treats me like a king.
Well I think you're a J.A.P.
So, do you want to come up?
Trust me. The truth is going to hurt me more than it hurts you.
Love stings, honey.
Honey, when I say to be as busy as a bee, I don't mean it literally!
Resigning from the party just seemed like an empty gesture.
Just tell people I've gone into hiving.
Winnie the who?
I have a severe case of hives.
..it's roomier than the ant hill, but much more noisy..
It may be an extreme case, but hives are not contagious.
Ok, I thought you said I needed to bee hive when your mother is visiting.
My health food store closed.
Is it safe to come out yet?
Being a WASP has nothing to do with it.
You were expecting Pooh?
I said on my profile that I was a WASP!
Wipe your feet.
No. I told you to behave.
I said I wanted to get a drone, not be one!
This is a fine time to let me know you sold my EpiPen on eBay!
You get more bees with honey, but with wasps you gotta stick your head right in there.
You can call me honey.
I'm busy.
You're right - the hats at H&M are probably cheaper.
It's better if we don't. My family doesn't like anyone getting too close.
I'm being held hostage until Scott Pruit is stung by some Africanized bees.
OK, I needed a little "me" time AND I needed a little "bee" time.
I realize there are better apartments in Brooklyn, but I'm only a two minute walk from Columbus Circle.
Where to begin...
Oh, well that profile picture was a year ago.
My high school yearbook predicted it.
Hear me out - it'll be the first article about pollinator decline from the bees' perspective.
I TOLD you work was becoming a real hornets' nest!
When Winnie the Pooh shows up, serve him with the divorce papers.
On the other hand, I get free honey.
Of course I want to leave my wife and marry you, Sally, and I'm sure this probably sounds like just another of my excuses, but my wife has dissolved my body and I'm stuck here for the time being. And that's the truth, sweetie.
Call the doctor, I think I have hives.
Can a Jewish girl like wasps?
I still refuse to call it 'The Stinger.'"
My advice? Just bee yourself.
The elderflower notes are so powerful from inside
I think I've had enough of your stinging rebukes.
Well the common charges are next to nothing, and you can't beat the taxes.
That stung.
Sorry, hon, the new job's been keeping me pretty busy.
Frankly you need me more than I need you.
Are you just in it for the honey?
Well, it could be worse.
Call the doctor. I think it's hives.
You think it was all the masturbation?
There's a lot of buzz about you.
No one can love those bee-stung lips as much as I do.
I love, honey, you.
I guess you called me "honey" once too many times.
This is considered physical therapy under the new health care bill!
The doctor said it's most likely hives.
Really, a man cave???
Ready to meet Mom?
Call 911 again, Lori! The next lady will believe you.
Thee doctor says it's the worst case of the hives he's ever seen.
Worst case of hives I've ever seen!
This is not what I meant when I said I wanted to marry a wasp.
What do you mean "all our friends are wasps"?
In the mood for a little pollenating?
Of course I'm the one everyone's buzzing about. Does that surprise you?
When my parents said they wanted me to marry a wasp, I don't think this is what they had in mind.
Mrs. Rabinowitz, the Jewish section is two blocks east of here.
Yes, I know, you said to call a professional.
Yes, I'm getting a divorce. And yes, the queen is better looking.
I found it on Air Bee & Bee.
I was just awarded "Employee of the Month" for my productivity.
I found out I was a 100% WASP.
You know, Ed's wife let him remodel the entire basement for his man-cave.

This IS my safe space...
Geez, Carol! Don’t tell me you’re doing the ‘funny mushrooms’ again.
I agreed to BDSM but at least show me a shoulder.
Ever heard of hive mind?
I decided to go all in and it hurts like hell.
I said, "Honey, Behave."
We are in the Silicon Valley, what did you expect for this price.
I've fully embraced the hive mind.
I'm finally learning how to Be!
All my people are wasps.
If the negotiators fail, be ready with my crossbow.
Confession time: I'm only part WASP.
Well you started it, calling me honey all the time!
The apiologist on my committee said I had to get closer to my subject.
I've had enough of your stinging remarks.

Oh, Honeycomb won't you be my baby Well, Honeycomb be my own.......
I told you I was going to go hang out in my man-hive... honey
Little help?
Less stress than my job at the White House
The hard part was climbing all the way up the tree.
thats the last time I'll use "Burts Bee's "shampoo!
Are you a WASP?
I always wanted to meet the Queen.
Dave, this Shakespeare pun is terrible.
What I was doing with the workers is none of your beeswax.
Sorry, I'm busy right now.
It's much bigger than it looks!
You be you and I'll bee me.
Would it surprise you if I said I'm actually Jewish?
Kiss me, you fool!
You knew when we married that I was a WASP.
I found out from Ancestry.com I'm 100% WASP.
What do you mean 'Whole Foods had it?'
Hang on, I'll buzz you in.
You're no longer, The Queen Bee around here!
All I know is that I was sleep walking.
Of course we've had fun together, I just needed a new direction. By the way, could you please cancel the exterminator.
Well if you think it's so easy, I'd like to see you try to tear a hole in the fabric of the space time continuum
Kissing frogs was becoming too easy.
To be or not to be, was NOT the question!
You said "hang in there."
No; I distinctly recall you saying it was a do-honey list.
So the comb over is a deal breaker?
Honey. Do you know where I put my comb?
Don't worry--my schtick is worse than my sting.
Would you believe I'm looking for my comb?
Two creams no sugar.
The hive mind was no help.
What's with the surprise? I told you I was a WASP!
I thought you had the hive next weekend.
I told you it was a little honey of a place...
Don't just stand there. Look for the rest of me.
I thought you meant you were Anglo Saxon...
The queen is busy right now.
Blown away by Dan's surprise beehive marriage proposal, Eileen says, yes.
Every breath you take, every move you make, I'll be watching you.
Believe me, I'll turn into a handsome prince. To be safe, however, make sure to bring your EpiPen.
Yes, the doghouse will be fine.
Well then what did you mean by 'just bee yourself?'
Nope, it's not in here either.
On the positive side, it's rent controlled.
No, I don't think I'm a queen.
You've heard of the bees knees, I'm a bit headier.
My new branch office is a real hornet's nest...
I guess this wasn't a good hiding place.
From the abandoned early draft: "I am Buzz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you and what --Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!"
Your place or mine?
You might want to take that off.
I feel like you always have your guard up around me.
My hives are getting worse.
I'm playing hide 'n seek.
Well, at least they call me "honey."
I've decided to mix business with pleasure.
Please don't kill the buzz...
The rooms are small, but there sure are a lot of them!
You always want to be Queen Bee. When is it my turn?
Getting beenapped isn't so bad, they let me have all the honey I can eat.
For heaven's sake, Henrietta, you always knew I was a WASP.
"Want to hear a Shakespeare joke".
If you just hadn't been such a buzz kill.../
So long, Honey.
You're the one I've been waiting for.
The Queen summoned me .
Hold the pesticides!
Heard a buzzing in my ears and here I am
No, I wasn't trying to tell you that I was a white, anglo-saxon protestant.
I thought that you wanted to live in a community where we all met regularly
I think that the realtor exaggerated the interior space. And there seems to be a bug problem.
I want you to know I've re-evaluated your suggestion we call a professional.
It's no big deal--I get hives every summer.
Why did you think I ordered a mail-order virgin queen? Now get in here!
And your question for the hive mind is…?
Is this your first time getting set up on beeharmony?
I'm feeling sticky.
Do you know if I'm trending on Facebook by any chance?
Turns out I'm 100% WASP.
It's the ultimate downsized tiny house . . . they're all the buzz.
I'm sorry I didn't answer, I accidentally left it on vibrate.
The name's Ethan, but you can call me Honey.
Go see Frank, they said. He has all the buzz, they said.
Just kiss me, so I can turn into something else.
I’m stuck here until winter. They think I’m their queen.
Brad, but you can just call me B.
If you want the honey, you have to earn their trust.
I'm a little buzzed
"I don't know, I guess I just expected you to look a little more like your profile pictures," Annabelle confessed, gazing apologetically into her Tinder date's soft, honey-glazed eyes.
Uh oh...Here comes the honey do list
This time the hive broke out into a me.
This doesn't have to change anything.
No. Really. You're my honey.
Yes -- I do have a 'bee in my bonnet'
It's a different kind of buzz.
At this point I have only drone status, so I can't talk for long.
Yes, I have heard the buzz .
Yeah, but they'll let me lower the thermostat whenever I want to.
I'm leaving you: she made me crown prince.
Gee, I never knew a queen bee's head was that big!
It's not as sticky as you'd think.
Kiss me and I will bee your prince.
Origami was too lonely.
I'm a soldier. One of 10,000.
Hive had the time of my life.
I'm not sure, but I think I have the hive's back...up.
Who put a bee in your bonnet?
Is this what you meant by wanting some space.
If I start droning on, just swat me.
My beard of bees has gotten out of control.
Why don't you just tweet the buzz?
I shouldn't have taken you so literally, when you wouldn't stop calling me Honey.
Ah ah ah ah staying a Hive!
You need to buzz the password.
Yes, I am that particular superhero, and I will sting the bejesus out of you if you tell anyone.
Your behavior is unacceptable.
I heard your mother was coming.
I know it's trendy to nest with someone, but this isn't going to work for me.
Winnie the Pooh made this look a lot easier don't ya think?
You want some honey, honey?
They're just as allergic to me.
I'm studying the hive mind.

I'm not coming home until you stop calling me Honey.
I misunderstood - I thought the job ad said "beekeeper"
Sorry, but they've given me my own room and all the honey I can eat.
I thought I told you to wait in the car.
Please don't be a buzz kill.

I realize this is a bit Kafkaesque
For reasons I don't understand Shel left me out of the whole tree story.
The Queen has a "Honey-Do" list longer than yours!
You know what Jane Goodall did for the chimps, right?
What can I say, I fell in love with the Queen.
Did you explain to my Doctor this isn't just an average case of The Hives ?
I meant to call, but you know how busy I've been.
I know it isn’t much, but you’ll be treated like a queen.
Looks like I'm not your only honey.
It suits me just fine, and it's below market-rate.
Honey, I was just trying to save the bees.
I was just humming along and they put me in the choir.
Can you mix me a stinger?
Turns out I'm 100% WASP.
I know. Rent's gotten crazy.
I'm a wasp, you're catholic - it'll never work.
I have left you for the queen.
It sure beats spending ANOTHER weekend with your mother.
And don't you dare call me "honey".
It was the cheapest rental I could find at Air Bee N Bee.
I have the hives.
Do you have any questions for the hive mind?
I'm filling in for the queen while she's on vacation, but I'll be free next week.
It's queen sized
I have a honey of a deal for you.
They adopted me when I was little.
I thought you were allergic to bees.
That's a lot of work just to avoid eating quiche.
I can't get any writing done in my apartment.
I'll do anything to be your honey.
Adopted or not, I can't date outside the hive.
Don't you see this as a metaphor for our relationship?
I didn't think your parents would accept me if I wasn't a wasp.
Kafka, Shmafka! It feels more like Thurber to me.
Give me a honey-do list, I do honey.
Sorry; it's none of your beeswax...
Tell Airbnb that we like the price but not the room.
I'm half Jewish half WASP.
I’m leaving you for the man in the moon.
Why yes, I have read The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest. Why do you ask?
I feel like you don't get me anymore, it really stings.
What's buzzin? Wanna hang together?
This isn't going to work out. You're too much of a loner.
It's a zen thing.
Minding my beeswax. And you?
You've never dated a wasp before?
Easy??? You should see my budget for Epipens.
You know, I can't say I appreciate your hive mentality.
And that's why I never called.
Because it's rent controlled.
I'm sorry, but it's true. I am a queen.
They made me their queen. You would've done the same.
You're the bees knees.
It's not a phase, it's a lifestyle.
Are you my queen?
I'm never coming back, Jane, so get over it.
Buzz off, Marsha.
I'm not coming out until 2020
You never treated me like a queen
The kids aren't here, dear--I'll check the anthill next.
Meow.
I only have hives for you.
You wanna be my Queen?
The Queen invited me.
I'll come back when your mother leaves.
Kiss me woman! But be careful!
I was bee-headed!
I've decided to bee.
Sorry, it's over -- I checked on Ancestry, and my family includes only WASPs.
It's OK darling. I know the genie misheard your wish that your husband made more money, not more honey.
I wanted to discover what "the buzz is all about."
They would prefer you not call me honey any longer.
I'm new to bumble.
Are you coming in or not
Little houses - it's all the buzz.
I was playing "Game of Thrones" and this was the only Queen spot available.
Hey, honey! Give me a buzz.
Yes, I landed in a hornet's nest this time.
Sorry honey, but please buzz off, we're a little busy right now.
I am not a WASP
You're a wonderful girl, but you're no queen.
I knew you'd come running to see what all the buzz was about.
It seemed like a good idea at the time ...
I'm sorry I keep droning on and on about my stinger , tell me about you !
So Alice, let's talk about your issues.
I like your knees.
When Bears Marinade
No girls allowed.
The buzz around town is that your husband is having an affair.
...then I said, Take me to your leader.
My online profile clearly stated WASP.
No, I'm not busy. Why do you ask?
I got the job at Buzzfeed
I'm deep into the honey do list
Maybe I was a bit hasty when I called YOU my queen.
Hush! The hive mind has spoken.
I'm the King Bee.
You're not the queen.
It's my man hive.
I thought I was your Queen Bee.
Corporate wanted buzz. Sorry, honey.
Would you please stop calling me Honey; it annoys the bees.
Honey, they've accepted me as their Queen!
I really thought that this was what Hamlet decided!
I told you to stop calling me honey!
Don't worry, you're still my queen.
I just couldn't take being an empty nester.
When I told the Bureau that I wanted to work in drone surveillance, this isn't what I had in mind.
Honey, I don't like your Halloween costume this year
Do you have to be such a buzzkill, Betty?
Yes, it's cramped but I had to get away from you for a while.
You said you wanted a tall honey
I've gotta see my allergist. My hives are out of control.
Sorry, but Her Majesty is currently indisposed.
"Not to be" - that is the answer.
Most wives just send their husbands to the dog house.
I'm confronting my WASP heritage.
No, you misunderstood when I said, 'I love you, honey.'
But the voice said loud and clear, "bee yourself."
I've never been so buzzed.
I was sitting under the tree reading Kafka's 'Metamorphosis,' when suddenly...
They're treating me fine but I've put on 20 pounds.
I said I'd behave, not beehive
It's helping with my anxiety.
I'm finally an empty nester.
Yes, okay, now you can tell my doctor that my case of the hives is serious.
Do you have any Benedryl? I've had hives before. But this is ridiculous.
Beehive yourself.
It's much larger than our Chinatown apartment, the neighborhood is quieter, plus the rent is stabilized.
Habitat for Humanity is starting to branch out.
You don't look much like your Tinder photo either.
I forgot to tell you; I'm a queen.
My head is buzzing, the queen's mad as a hornet, and you just stand there droning on and on.
Nobody taught me about the birds and the bees
This doesn't make you King of anything, idiot!
I have a confession to make.
It's been 265 days. They haven't noticed yet.
Go ahead be honest. I can take your stinging comments.
You're the one who suggested urban beekeeping.
Now is not a good time. We're busy as...well you know.
Say what you will, I'm all the buzz.
Nice soliloquy, but you're no Prince Hamlet!
I got the sting like a bee part -- now show me you can float like a butterfly.
I decided to immerse myself in the hivemind.
Here's the latest buzz."
'You'd better get out of there before you get hives.'
Honey, I knew this would get your attention.
Its something I read about on BuzzFeed
It's not the best job in the world. But I find it helps to bee positive.
That 'lose your stinger' business is no myth.
She'll only negotiate queen to queen.
It had to bee you...
The Air Bee 'n' Bee concept needs work.
They misunderstood me at the beauty parlor.
Do you want to hear my Hamlet soliloquy?
You're right - I do bug you a lot.
Why it is OK for you to celebrate your ethnic heritage but when we White Anglo Saxon protestants want to do the same thing it is suspect?
It's just until we can get a mortgage."
This is better than the daily assaults on Twitter.
I know it doesn't seem that way, but I fit in here.
Are you sure this will clear up my acne?
I'm training for a job in the White House.
The good part is that I'm never lonely.
Will you Bee my valentine?
It’s not racist, it’s just a symbol of pride in my heritage as a WASP.
I told you I wasn't a WASP.
They say bee pollen lowers blood pressure so I thought I'd give it a try.
If you can't beat em, bee em.
Just hanging out. You?
I checked "White" on the Ethnicity and Race Identification Form, and the next thing I know I was stuffed in here.
What do you mean, your mother won't let you date WASPs?
Her majesty asks who is calling.
But you asked me to bee myself?
They aren't very good with a lance but they are killer with powerpoint.
I'm not sure; I've been stung before.
You've never heard of hive mentality?
I saw what happened to the Giving Tree. I'm just putting my defenses up.
Sorry, blind dates give me hives.
Worst case of hives ever!
What's the buzz, Honey?
What? You told me to find a different honey.
I've never been a people person.
I was thinking I should start a Winnie the Pooh support group.
They want to make me their queen.
I suffer from hives.
Too bee, or not too bee - what do you think?
You'd be surprised at the amenities.
I just need a little quiet time......
Hey, it's Brooklyn. This is all I could get for $1000 a month.
Surprise - I'm a queen!
I thought you were supposed to be a frog.
I told you this airbnb sounded like a hoax!
"Honey" is an expression of love. It is not a demand!
I'm trying to remind you of that tingly feeling you used to get when we kissed.
Try all you want. There's no sugarcoating this one.
_Now_ am I waspy enough for your parents?
I may be a WASP, but I assure you I don't summer in Nantucket.
This was the last place she expected to find her honey.
Really? A bee hive? All I did was sleep with your sister.
Sorry I'm being so waspish today.
I have to break our date. I think I have hives!
The Queen is dead, Margaret. Long live the King!
Would you like to come in and catch a buzz?
Victoria, will you 'Bee Mine'? Get it?
Be still!
So, what's all the buzz about?"
Oh, You thought I was that kind of WASP!
You are giving me mixed messages.
But my profile clearly states that I'm a wasp.
I had to see what the buzz was all about.
I told you to mind your own beeswax....
Don't you dare call me honey
I have them right where I want them.
I'm really not feeling this Air BnB.
Sorry Honey, I'm a queen.
I knew that one day my queen would come
I'm very busy.
it's a great way to get a buzz.
I know desperate times call for desperate measures, but really?????
I can't. I've sworn allegiance to the Queen.
A short-tempered Genie with road rage! What more is there to know?
Whatever you do, don't call me honey!
Has your mother gone home yet?
I didn't believe you when you said, 'Burt, from Burt's Bees.'
It's a co-living building. Quite nice actually, free honey too.
I've been working 9 to hive this week.
It's actually bigger than the other tiny house.
Come get me in four years.
My therapist told me to bee myself.
Your not gonna win this stare down!
I swear, you're my only queen.
Because this is where the honey is.
So it's a "no" on the whole birds and the bees thing?
Honey, I just wanted you to bee yourself
I'm the queen's favorite.
Could you please stop calling me honey.
Trust me, you'll fit - just take your shoes off.
To bee, or not to bee? That is the question, and I think you have my answer.
Don't try to obscure what really matters here, Paula.
I live in New Canaan. Of course I'm a WASP.
Honey, hive been thinking a lot lately about global swarming...
Be Sweet.
Give me a buzz if you need anything.
We're going to need another week before the bespoke craft honey is ready.
Honey, don't be so literal.
It's not you. I don't know why I push people away.
I thought you said, "Honey, bring home something sweet."
I am going to stick with store honey
Bzzzz, bzzz, bzzzzz bzz!!
Honey, you're not gonna believe it. It sleeps 10,000 and for only $900 a month.
I guess I was just sick and tired of bee-ing in the dog house!
Well I call it in flagrante delicioso.
You say "hive mentality" like that's a bad thing.
We are entertaining candidates for a new Queen.
Behave or bee hived
I thought I told you my family were WASPs.
No. I'm positive. We already have a Queen.
You know what they say about big nests...
No more honey-dos.
Once a WASP always a wasp
Busy as always. You?
Now that's a Honey Trap
So it turns out BEEBEESITTER NEEDED wasn't a typo.
I'm sorry I called you an uptight WASP.
I have no relationship with bees. Fake news!
Help me...help me!
What's the Buzzword?
My husband likes it when I wear my hair down, but really, the beehive looks great on you!
I was looking for my glasses.
I think we should start seeing other people.
Why do other husbands get to go to a doghouse when they're bad?
No, no, honest it's not what it looks like. You're my only honey!
But you said that I should find myself a hobby.
But she's a queen honey.
I told you I was competitive, Karen. It was your idea to watch Tiny House Nation.
I told you my case of hives was serious, Carol.
To bee, or not to bee.
It's my man-scape, o.k. !
But It's rent-controlled!
Would you be a dear and get me out of here?
That's OK, I've never dated a Jew.
I'm tired of being your drone.
They want me to be their king.
I'd invite you in, but my queen's a bitch.
You told me to bee myself.
Well, once you get used to the buzzing...
I know about the man in the moon, but this is absurd!
It's the latest in immersion experience.
I'm having tea with the Queen.
What do you want Martha? I'm in line to see the queen!
You look just like your profile picture.
"Lose the man bun," fine. How about a man hive?
Commitment gives me hives.
OK, they do ask for directions -- but they won't talk about their feelings.
Thousands of years later, and you still fall for this.
Why are you surprised? I told you I was a WASP in my profile.
The hive mind says we're incompatible.
The man-in-the-moon job was taken.
So, do you hang out here often?
THIS is what happens when you tell me to mind my beeswax!
Yes, I was raised Protestant...why do you ask?
"I'll come home, but only if I can be King Bee!
White Anglo-Saxon Protestant? Sorry! doesn't ring a bell.
I knew I should not have eaten those strawberries! They always give me the hives!
It's over honey, these are my friends now.
Honey, it's a sting operation.
You're different now does not explain why you didn't come home.
Honey, is that you?
They followed me home.
No, Bill. It's the cockroaches that will survive nuclear war. The cockroaches.
My torso isn't here either ...
I can't I am busy.
It's complicated, but, yes, you are still my honey.
See, my head isn't always in the clouds.
This time you literally got yourself into a hornets' nest, huh?
I have no idea about how the birds do it.
Honest dear, It's not what you think.
Well, that's capitalism for you.
Could you get my bug spray in the golf bag?
..and did I mention it comes with a dishwasher?
I think I misunderstood what a Bumble date was.
For personal reasons, I will no longer hide the fact that I am a WASP from anyone who asks.
Alright, but your cleavage signifies just as much mysticism.
Unlike you, they're very welcoming......
What's the current "BUZZ"?
At least, they call me honey!
I told you we should've brought my Epipen.
The network said I mostly appeal to WASPs.
They decided they wanted a king.
My shrink called it "Sadomasochistic Nesting Syndrome."
Honey, just bee yourself.
And you swore you'd never be flagrant about your northeast elitism.
Sorry, but since the election I've developed a hive mentality.
Forget town halls, I'm staying here during the summer recess.
Sorry, I'm in love with the Queen.
My tinnitus doesn't seem so bad in here.
I'm just getting a buzz on.
There's a bird nest in the limb above.
Ours is a romance fraught with peril, Sheila.
I've been looking for my honey.
But I aspire to be king.
I know Lydia--but no broker's fee!
I am the queen
I could care less what kind of tattoo you've got.
Guess you caught me with more than just my hand in the honey pot this time!
They understand me more than you ever will.
What honey? Sorry, I can't hear you. This tinnitus is killing me.
This is what happens when you DIS a bee!
Your mother said I wasn't WASPish enough for her tastes.
So, do you hang out here often?
'We need a queen bee , thanks for applying"
'Don't worry, I'm armless.'
They don't admit I'm here.
They won't hurt you if you stay calm.
My editor sent me out to gather the latest buzz.
My name's Paul Innate. I like your dress.
I hate to be a buzz kill but the exterminators here
Would you like to meet the Queen?
My mother warned me not to marry a WASP
I asked you to make more MONEY, with an "M"!
Your place or mine?
I would tell you what's on my mind, but it's really none of your beeswax.
I'm not interested, so buzz off.
There. That's my part of the talk. Your mother is waiting in the bird nest.
Don't forget to bring me some royal jelly!
Bee my honey
And what were your other two wishes?
No one was surprised to learn that they met on a dating app called Bumble
Oh BEHAVE! I thought you said BEEHIVE!
Couldn't beat 'em: I joined.
Oh brother, this is a real hornet's nest you've gotten into this time.
I have hives.
There just isn't room for you in my new life.
Look... I'm just a character in a dream. How am I supposed to know what Freud would say?
You get hives your way, I'll get them mine.
When one is summonsed by the queen, you just must show up.
"Sorry honey, I've been busy as 'you know what', can I give you a buzz later"?
I am not hive-minded!
Sorry, but the Queen needs me.
I suppose when the listing said this was a 'quaint, friendly co-op suite in a complex with a lot of buzz,' it was technically accurate.
I am white, Anglo-Saxon and Protestant, but perhaps not quite a human as you might have been expecting.
I swear I've looked everywhere for Junior's Pooh Bear.
Can you wait till the birds arrive?
They're demanding a sit with the CEO of Monsanto or I'm a goner.
That dress may be too enticing for my roommates.
Oh, I'm the head bee.
Well everyone wants to be a pollen collector, but I have found hive repair to be truly rewarding.
I wanted to get closer to your mom.
Can I get you anything, honey?
I've learned the secret for making honey, but its really REALLY gross.
Due to recent budgetary constraints, we have had to modify our Global Swarming study.
My family left, you can come out now.
You give a new meaning to stalking !
I'm pretty buzzed.
But you said you'd only marry a WASP
Rent was too high at the apiary.
It's none of your beeswax what I'm doing in here!
Darling, your stinging retorts have finally taken on a life of their own.
“My Match.com profile says I’m a WASP. What did you expect?
You look different from your Bumble profile.
Yes, but it's a dry-sting.
Bee Attitudes.....
My tinder profile generates a lot of buzz.
"No, it's not ideal. But it beats the hell out of an afternoon with the McCarthys.
I installed an upgrade for the Bumble app.
Do you think you're taking this back to nature thing a bit too far?
I thought Hive Mind was an internet thing.
For the longest time I thought it was just tinnitus.
I work for the discovery channel: do you think we have lost touch with nature?
Turns out I found my queen after all.
I'm minding my Bees and Ques
Yes, it's over, honey.
I'll bee right down, honey.
You said you wanted everything fresh.
I was told the best way to reclaim you was beehivioral therapy.
Can you get me a sandwich?
"You know this isn't what I meant, when I told you to behave yourself".
I have no more time for metaphors!
You were peeking.
The frog already used that line!
My dating profile clearly states WASP.
Ohhh, you said "beHAVE yourself." Whoops...
I bet they never expected an audit as thorough as this one.
I will grant you three wishes, just as long as they're bee-related.
I wouldn't have minded if you'd kept this off the honey-do list.
Works wonders on wrinkles.
``Can you break a twenty?''
Everyone's all up in my business and the queen won't give me the time of day.
Love, I honey you.
Him: Honey, you won't bee-lieve how I got stuck in here. Her: It's none of my bzz-ness.
"The buzz is the exit poll for the election of our new queen".
Don't you 'Honey' me mister!!!
Sorry but the queen promised me my own man cave.
It was either this or nothingness.
Lo and beehold
I don't want to talk about it.
Yes, it's always buzzing around here.
Yeah, but you don't have arthritis.
This takes the sting out of my hives.
It started with a fascination with bees and honey and progressed from there!
I thought I signed up for EHarmony not BeeHarmony
Alexa doesn't know when you'll be in for lunch.
I'd think twice before applying. Every day here, someone's stirring up a hornets' nest.
I expected it to be roomier.
Go away, I'm busy.
It's not cramped in here, it's hygge!
But you always said how retirement was about staying busy and finding a purpose.
Honey, life couldn't be more beatific!
I told you I would fit.
Well, for one thing, I'm damned busy.
I am NOT putting on the bird costume.
You can't always be the queen bee.
Buzz off!
You DID say you wanted to meet a WASP!
What you said really stings, Doris." "Mind your own beeswax Doris" "I've got a bad case of hives
I am the Zorax, I speak for the bees.
How can I be a WASP, I'm not a Protestant?
Ms. High and Mighty never shared an apartment before, I guess.
But all I said was, "I think I'll never see a bee as lovely as a tree."
Who's the queen now?
It's the one place they won't expect to find me.
Wanna hang out?
We voted and you'll not receive the rose.
When I signed up for Bumble, I didn't realize what I was getting myself into!
This is what happens when you're late, Kathleen.
I couldn't very well tell the queen no after she invited me in.
That's a myth. We don't sting without cause. Now, will you marry me or not?
I can't tonight. I'm busy.
I know you're busy.
I'm an imported pollinator.
I'm sorry, Sophia, but I can't live a lie anymore. Inside, I've always been a raging queen.
I've been bee-headed!
See I told you I was a good worker.
Really, a live/work space just makes so much more sense.
You heard me. Its none of your beeswax.
Mind your own beeswax, darling.
What did you expect when you joined Bumble?
I have a crush on the queen.
Does it go without saying, it would behoove me to request you not tell anyone about this?
I have to break up with you. You aren't waspy enough.
Honey! I said for you bee the best you can....But this is taking it a bit to
They don't seem to mind when I drone on.
I'm fine here, OK? Mind your own beeswax.
Well think it over, you can be the queen! On the bright side, they've agreed to let you be I'm trying to blend in. Could you do the little bee dance like you know where the pollen is.
Wasp? No, I'm Catholic.
I'm leaving you--It's just I favor pollination over procreation.
Be careful what hobbies you choose.
She's a Queen. You're a Karen.
I think we should start seeing other people.
Damn stem cells!
Face it honey, the buzz is gone.
No, no, I wished that you behave, but I have sinus issues.
How did you know where I'd bee?
I don't get why you won't "bee" my "honey."
My doctor says it's just hives.
Forget the man cave. I have a man hive!
I know I don't look it, but I'm Jewish.
Honey, I told you, my mother left an hour ago.
Stop stirring up the hornets' nest, I need you more at home.
Believe me, I'd rather be here than engage with social media.
No, Diane, it doesn't beat the doghouse.
It's rent-controlled.
You knew I was a WASP when you married me.
Birds do it, Bees do it, even educated fleas do it, lets do it, lets fall in love.
Thought you said we're playing "hive and seek"
Nothing. How about you?
What?! Do I look like I'm made of honey?
Yeah, well, the sex is unbelievable.
Sorry, I'm kind of busy.
We do more than just pollinate, you know.
"You'll always be my honey"!
You have any idea what a hive in the city costs?
What's the matter, is this your first Bumble date?
Ignore the bees. Focus on the honey.
The flowers on your dress say "yes", but the look on your face says "buzz off!"
I'll have you know that I'm the foremost authority on stinging rebukes.
I'll make sure to read the 'honey do' list more carefully next time.
See, honey, this is what the buzz is all about
You told me to buzz off.
No! No! Do not call the exterminator.
Kind of ruins your mental image of the "birds and the bees" doesn't it?
You're right--too many bees in one's bonnet results in loss of focus.
I know you told me to stop calling that Wiccan waitress Honey
It's okay. They think I'm a really big hornet.
I promise to ‘behave' if you promise to work on your Southern accent before making any more wishes.
I was lonely on the moon.
I'll think about your drawing but in the meantime I have a caption in need of a drawing. Two people at a cocktail party - #1: Any kids? #2; Yes, 2 millenials and a gen z...
The hard part was getting into our daughter's bumble bee Halloween costume.
The pay's lousy but the job security is great.
I know I called you a drone for not working, but I didn't think you'd take it literally.
This is the most organic honey I could find.
It's MY turn to be Queen bee.
Just wait till we have our own swarm, things will be different.
I am neither forbidden nor am I a fruit.
I think I have tinnitus.
Face facts, Muriel, my new life is none of your beeswax.
Stop accusing me of having a "hive mentality".
We could make a bid on it, or we could just wait to see if there's a die-off.
I'm not quite sure why I was bee-headed.
Instead of loading out make a pot of tea.
I'm totally buzzed.
I admit it - I'm a closet queen.
Sorry, I'm the new queen. So buzz off!!
I've heard a lot of good buzz about this place.
Please don't call the exterminator yet; I think we're making real progress here!
I prefer to think of it as my natural evolution into the hive mind.
Next week we will move on to method acting.
Your suspicions may have been correct, I'm being coronated this evening.
This is neither method acting, nor what Hamlet meant, Marlon.
You said we needed to downsize.
A word to the wise – avoid the honey.
My office is a hornet's nest. I figure it can't get any worse hanging out here.
I swear, she means nothing to me - you'll always be my true queen!
Call a doctor. I think I have hive.
Keeps me on top of the latest buzz.
Honey, I think I'm a little buzzed.
Really, John? Just when I didn't think you could get any cheaper.
I have a question for the hive mind....
Last week, it was the birds' nest. So after this, I'll be ready for some whoopee!
...and not a single complaint about my incessant humming.
You could've just told me you were a queen.
Don't be silly, the last guy I dated was on death row... this is way less complicated.
Not now, I'm busy.
I'm with the Beyhive now.
You're always too busy to talk.
Sorry. My new honey is a queen.
I've got to bee me.
Well, you're the one that wanted me to find an affordable place in Manhattan.
I can't find any honey, Honey.
Living in a Libertarian colony is not as satisfying after all.
Don't worry! It has a lovely view, and look at the price!
I don't know, honey, it just feels safer in here.
You're looking at the new king.
If I said you were the bee's knees, would you be my queen?
This was the only option available in the witness protection program.
I don't think it's in your best interests for this relationship to continue.
Honey, don't worry ... its just beesness.
Hi, I'm BUZZ, you must be 'the Honey'!
You sure got a bee in YOUR bonnet!
"Just don't call me honey".
My doctor thinks it's hives.
I wanted to save them, but, in the end, they saved me.
Naturally, I turned them down a number of times. But their 401(k) proved beyond irresistible.
I'm taking the tiny house movement to the next level.
In the end, it's not worth all the buzz.
Honey, I just need to bee for a while.
And then she said, "Have I got a honey of a deal for you!'
So, what's the buzz around the neighborhood?
#DumpedWifeForTheBeyhive
It's more sustainable than a tiny house
It's not that I fear commitment, but there's just not enough room for you to move in.
What can I say, it's rent controlled.
All of the Safe Spaces were taken
Spare me the Hamlet jokes.
You don't always get to bee who your want to bee
Would you consider selling?
This job does have great health insurance.
Mom always said I was a WASP.
Don't you 'honey' me!
They needed a king and so I accepted
I'm proud to be a WASP.
Your mom didn't tell you all of it.
Welcome to the Tiny House Revolution.
Never bet with a Witch.
This isn't what I imagined when they said I was drafted by the Hornets.
It's part of my mindfulness training: identifying with the aggressor.
The queen proposed to me -- I couldn't refuse.
You were supposed to bring the birds.
I told you I was adopted.
I love the buzz!
I've been bee-headed!
You said you "have to have raw honey... the stuff at the store is processed." Well, it doesn't get any rawer than this, honey.
Look, it worked for Jerry Seinfeld.
I will miss you too, but I need to be part of a collective that works together
I didn't think it would happen this way when I prayed to God to introduce me to my future honey!
Cut me out in 2020.
Maybe you didn't understand, but I did tell you we might have problems with my ethnicity.
The queen said I could stay as long as I like.
My doctor said it's an allergic reaction to your perfume. It causes me to break out in hives.
Sorry I have to break our date. I've got hives.
I tried to catch a buzz
It's just for a day.
I prefer the dog house.
In that moment Janet realized it wasn't just a mid-life crisis.
And whom shall I say wishes an audience with the Queen?
But Mom, where are the birds?
No, I'm not coming home. I really believe this is where I belong.
You are very cute but I think we should keep our distance.
...was never a question for me.
I'm stuck.
I finally answered it: to be.
Are you new to match.com?
I'm trying to bee all that I can bee.
Did my receptionist tell you where to find me?
What? You knew I was a W.A.S.P. when you married me.
The Queen is not amused.
Can't talk to you right now, I'm buzzed.
The ad said 'snug space, Central Park views, sweetest deal on the UWS. Of course I took it!
Honey, do we have something to get rid of hives?
Yeah, but it's a honey of a deal for a studio.
Welcome to the hive mind.
Actually, I'm Irish Catholic.
Sorry - we already have a queen bee.
Me Hiveman, you honeybunch.
I told you I'm busy
I'm not coming out until you calm down.
Did your mother leave yet?
You're right, we should have gotten the honey with the undertones of lavender. This one screams dandelions.
No? Does that anything to do with my being a WASP?
No, I said beHAVE yourself!
I need a buzz.
I swear I'm not honey-dicking you, Janet.
Too Bee or not to Bee, that is the question Honey.
I got the idea from those tiny house shows.
I'd say it's more serious than a simple case of hives.
I asked you not to call me Honey.
Things just make more sense in here.
Good thing I am not allergic.
Just because you've been stung before, doesn't mean all us bees are bad guys.
Oh...tiny HOUSE.
I am the Lorax. I now speak for the bees. And you bastards better listen this time!
It could have been worse. You should see what happened to Larry!
The burning bush was already taken.
I'll be home after spring pollination.
But you said your parents would prefer you dated a W.A.S.P?
Six more hours and I make the Guinness Book of World Records.
That's just how they are. I know you were speaking figuratively, and you know you were speaking figuratively, but THEY take everything so literally...so next time please just call me "Dear."
What did you expect? I'm White, Anglo-Saxon, and Protestant.
Really ? Hamlet ?
Kiss me and the bees will disappear
And then I thought, heck, why just cocoon when I could hive.
I don't think you thought this through.
We can still pollinate.
Because you told me to buzz off.
I am serious. And don't call me honey.
Winnie the Pooh made it look so easy.
You said, "behave?" I thought you said "be hive.
"They elected me queen. How could I say no?
Stay right there. Smoke some cigarettes. Maybe we can all calm down.
I'm still working on the "float like a butterfly" part.
I finally feel accepted.
You will do Anything to avoid my Mom!
You must have misread my profile, I make a lot of honey.
I said behave. Behave yourself. Not behive.
It's not how it was advertised on Airbnb.
Marry a WASP and you get the family too. Deal with it.
I told my place had a view of Central Park!
If you're looking for your honey, here I am.
I've found a new queen.
"You wouldn't believe the buzz I get, from this Colorado marijuana.
Marry me and I will make you a Queen.
She means nothing to me. You'll always be my real queen.
Honey, you are definitely my queen.
Now do you believe I'm a WASP?
Just hanging around, and you?
Sure, it's tight, but my share of the rent is tiny.
Am I single? None of your bees-wax!
It's the newest Instagram trend: #hiving.
Of course you wouldn't see what the buzz is about. That's what stings, Margaret.
Tell me a little bit about yourself while we wait for the birds
So, what's all the buzz about?"
To be or not to be...that is the conundrum.
You looked so much different on your Bumble profile.
The worst part? I'm allergic to bees.
Honey, I said honey,any who call Guinness book of world records ,one more night I break the record..
A little about me?... I brew my own kombucha, competitively yodel and count bees among my friends.
It's me, not you.
They waived condo fees for 2 years.
Please I'm begging you don't call me"Honey".
No, really I'm a piñata.
This is my place now, what I do here is none of your beeswax.
Burt's not in.
I'm realizing now that you said I should behave myself
I’m just conscious that what you’re wearing might attract bees. That’s all.
I'm have a message for the queen.
I know, I know. You didn't drive all the way up to the Adirondacks to binge-watch 'Game of Drones.'
Would you consider kissing me? Might get me back to being a frog.
Oh honey, do beehive!
It's desensitization therapy for my claustrophobia.
I can bee whatever you want me to bee!
When I told you to buzz off during the divorce, I didn't think you would take it literally.
Your mother-in-law is still allergic to bees right?
"This is how I get my buzz on since I quit drinking".
Give me a buzz sometime
Let me bee, honey.
You buzzed?
I thought I told you not to bother me when I'm working!
Do you remember the movie 'The Fly'.......?
Kiss me if you really love me!
Call me honey again. I dare you.
Please, just one kiss and I'm free!
So honey, what's the buzz about the new neighbors down the street?
As one wasp to another...
I just needed a little "bee" time.
I picked up an extra shift, will you leave some meatloaf in the oven?
I distinctly said: "Beam me up".
But this is where the wifi signal is strongest.
I like it in here, and stop calling me Honey.
Are you interested in a timeshare here?
Honey, I've been as busy as a bee.
I didn't like botox.
Don't call me honey anymore
I've always wanted to feel like the Queen Bee.
It's got upsides and downsides, but it's very clean.
It won't work. You're Jewish, and I'm a WASP.
I don't even feel buzzed.
Last refuge for us wasps
What? I am just hanging out with my waspie friends.
Have you heard of a bee whisperer?
I'm trying to decide whether to bee or not to bee.
I hope the rejection doesn't sting too badly
... And frankly, Lois, it's just none of your beeswax.
You know what they say .... "you never really know someone until you live with them."
I'm beginning to not like the matriarchal society.
You make me want to be a better person.
I thought I wanted a princess, but it turns out I need a queen.
Heh heh. Hi honey. My queen. To bee or not to bee? Got quite a buzz on. Heh. Heh.
When you told me you had hives, I had no idea!
Just bee yourself
You just have to be the Queen Bee, don't you?
Sorry, there's only room for one.
Is it my beeswax now?!
No, I won't bee your honey!
I write for Buzzfeed.
I think we could have just told my family we met on Bumble.
I said, "honey, you need to behave" not "honey, you need to behive".
We really have our work cut out with this bunch.
I'm doing research for another Wicker Man remake.
How's this work for you?
I had to see what the buzz was all about.
Do NOT call me honey!
Is your mom still here?
I told you upfront that I was a WASP
Honey, I had a nightmare last night that I was stuck in a beehive.
My realtor said it's a honey of a deal.
Apiarist nirvana gone horriby wrong.
I just wanted to know what all the buzz was about.
What did you think I meant when I put WASP on my profile?
You said you wanted organic honey.
Helen, you were right! I needed to evolve.
It wasn't you; it was the tweets.
I hate to be a pest, but do you have any antihistamine?
No, this is the best way to get a buzz.
I've told you before, there are obvious reasons we can't have sex.
You still don't believe me !
Because man-caves are soooo last century...
I guess it's just not meant to bee
The queen wants to discuss Beexit.
Come on babe; we haven't pollenated in weeks.
That was the question, so I decided to bee.
I want you to be my queen
I'm a born and bred WASP.
We can't meet like this; my husband is getting suspicious.
I like the fact that no one bugs me here.
Shhhh, don't call me 'honey'!
I have become one with the hive.
I finally succeeded in generating some buzz.
This is none of your beeswax.
Surprise! I'm learning how to make honey for you!
You're still going to my parents' this weekend.
When I said I wanted to be a drone, this wasn't what I meant.
Don't worry, I'll give you a buzz next week.
Bee careful what you wish for honey, being queen for a day is not all it's cracked up to bee.
Common mistake. I'm actually a hornet, not a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant.
Yes, you are sweet, but you're always hanging around.
Not to worry, I'm just catching a buzz.
To be a bee or not be a bee. That is the question.
There's a buzz about me, no?
No, I don't have any allergies. Why do you ask?
Sorry, hon, but I stopped for a quick drink after work and now I'm totally buzzed.
Turns out they're not more scared of us than we are of them
I'm here to grant you three wasps.
You always wanted a small place in the country. So what is the problem .
Sure it gets noisy sometimes, but you'd be amazed how spacious it is inside here.
I'm still your honey.
#NotAllMen am I right?
Please call Vector control.
I moved out.
Now you know why I call you, 'Honey.'
I've read your Honey-Do lists for the last time.
My name is Bea. What's yours?
Where are the birds?
But it's a neighbourhood we love and within our price range.
Dinner at 7? Great! I'll be there.
Hi honey, I am home.
It's all I could afford.
Is this Waspish enough?
The kitchen is small but the view is fantastic.
My third wish was to have a permanent buzz.
I may have misread your "honey do list".
It's not a good idea to call a witch a WASP, even in Connecticut.
With the Birkenstocks and the cute sundress, I thought you were one too.
I told you -- I've been busy as a bee.
Really, it's not you it's bees.
If short ain't your thing, buzz off.
Your expression belies the humor in this.
My therapist told me to just bee myself.
I can't explain why they feel like they do about their queen--I just know I would do anything for them.
I don't think this is the kind of buzz my dating coach was referring to.
Will that be with or without Rosebud Nectar?
Someone said to try being a human being instead of a human doing.
Why can't you ever just let me bee?
Yes, but it's famuly
When I told you to buzz off, Marilyn, I meant it!
In my former life, I was Jewish.
Very clever disguise, dear. However, "To be or not to be" is spelled with one "e," not two.
Our Swarm Theory research grant was not as rich as we hoped for!
And he thought the dog house was bad...
It's a twist on the Sean Spicer thing, okay?
I'm the sweetest guy you'll ever meet.
You are the most bee-utiful of all.
Hive, Hive, on the tree, who is the bee's knees?
Then I was asked, "How would you like to be the new face of WASPdom?"
Are you a WASP?
Profile pictures always lie.
I'm only in it for the honey.
My travel agent didn't tell me it was a literal BNB.
But, my mother warned me against a relationship with a WASP.
I double dare you.
Does it itch?
But honey, I've found the true meaning of the affection, "honey"..
You know your stink eye gives me hives.
WASPS need safe spaces too.
I'm fine, dear, just a little buzzed.
This place is awesome there are no HOA fees.
I told you to behave yourself last night - not BEE HIVE!
Don't you "But Honey, Me!"
Queen? I don't know nothin' about no Queen.
So that is where WASPs come from.
We all come with baggage.
Hi honey, I'll bee right out.
I need to cancel our date for tonight. I have a slight case of the hives.
If you keep calling me Honey, I'm going to stay here.
Why not slip into something more comfortable, honey?
Pretend you don't know what's going on.
Honey will you bee my valentine?
Home Sweet Home.
Hello! Welcome to Trump's Hanging Gardens.I am Preet Bharara. You'll find Yates and Comey in the next row.
I'm auditioning to be a tv talking head.
No, really. My forefathers came over on the Mayflower.
In a jealous rage the queen cast this spell on me, but a kiss from a honey like you will set me free.
I know I look a bit different from my profile picture, don't be such a buzz kill.
It's part of a diversity effort. I'm Catholic.
Oh yeah baby, believe me, I won't sting!
What?!... You've known all along that I'm a WASP.
Gimme a buzz when you have a sec.
It's OK to kiss me. I'm famous. Have you heard of The Green Hornet?
I'll relay your message to the Queen.
While we've got your attention, important journalism is expensive and we would appreciate a donation…
Trump means WASPs are back, right?
What can I say? The bird's nest was too small.
I'm sorry, but I'm in love with another honey.
Look, you have your 'safe place' on campus...well this one's mine!
I thought you told me to beehive.
Really, John? The lengths you go to be right.
And yes, I am also Protestant.
When your mother comes to visit I find the best hiding place that I can.
It's inconsequential.
I swear----I really feel them sprouting------
Bee my, bee my, bee my baby tonight Court me on Honey, Bee my baby tonight
Harold, I told you that I love my babydoll dress on you but that’s NOT the beehive hairdo.
I think you're taking work's idea of embracing the hive mind too literally darling !
Well I tried sailing, tennis...even played bridge. Maybe THIS will please your WASPY parents.
I'm having a drink with a thousand of my closest friends.
The tree took from me today.
Sweetie. I'm OK. The new Queen keeps me as "keeper of the hive"." "Really, Clive. I told you to lay off the bee pollen.
Hello hon...-uh, sweetheart.
I'll bee right back.
Treason? no! I am just collecting honey from Russia.
Kiss my face, hon and you will set me free!
Yes, as you may have long suspected, I am a wasp.
Instead of stinging me, they're holding me hostage.
You may bee wondering why I'm here, honey.
There you go again accusing me of being guarded.
I used royal jelly on my PB&J
You can be my queen.
I do like you very much, Walter. And daddy says you're waspy enough for our family. But mother isn't sure.
Now if you be a bird, I think we can get this marriage thing working.
I shan't pay the least attention to any buzz about a bee-headed witch like you.
They've started calling me the Paulinator.
So, you just HAD to play your favorite song, 'Let it Be' at my memorial service. You know how I really hate that!
I told you to stop calling me honey!
Don't call me "Sweetheart." I prefer "Honey."
If a Trump can be a president then I can be a queen.
Its given me perspective on the importance of being more literal on what you wish for.
Fake news endgame: all buzz, no body.
Now my kisses will make you buzz!
Welcome to the world's cheapest air bee and bee.
Donald, The words to that song are NOT: Bee it ever so bumble...
Please don't ask where they're keeping the honey.
It's not as sociable in here as one might think.
Don't worry -- bee happy!
It is time to leave the nest honey. The pool party begins in one-half hour.
I decided "to bee" is better than "not to bee."
Now I am both a head and a basket case, darling.
You laugh, but I'm having dinner with the queen.
Help me. I'm stuck in this really dumb cartoon drawing.
Sorry, I was actually looking for the bee's knees.
Worst Marriage Proposals Ever: "Would you be my Queen bee?"
What did you expect when you married a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant?
You asked me to comb my hair!
I'm having my stinger sharpened.
Listen honey, I'm not coming out until Trump starts caring about the honey bees.
Got milk?
Once you get past the stings, it's oddly comforting
Are you my queen?
Let me tell you about the birds & the bees & the flowers & the trees....
Hives. Did you put peanuts in your brownies?
I've formed a joint task force with the hornets to address common outdoor threats.
It's a remake of The Unbearable Lightness of Bee-ing.
Maybe now you'll stop addressing women at the office as "honey!"
I'm sorry, it just wasn't meant to bee.
I heard the beehive hairdo was back in style.
Sometimes the path to enlightenment is to just bee.
I've decided to bee.
Babe, I can be anything you want me to bee
It has a je ne sais quoi buzz about it
I left you, Heather, because of the pain and bitterness in our lives together. Yes, there's still pain but the sweetness makes it all worth while.
This isn't exactly what I had in mind when you said you come from a family of WASPs.
Good morning, honey!
Wanna come in for a drink?
Buzz, what's yours?
You misunderstood. To bee or not to bee was NOT the question.
Oh, hi Susan. I'll bee out in a minute.
I told you I was in a real hornets' nest - now do you believe me?
"Honey, excuse the puns, but you really are killing my buzz".
I just want to be your honey
I really like your dress, Janice.
You said you wanted organic honey.
I followed the buzz
Small? Well, you're right. But don't you love the buzz?
Nesto, when I said "The ICE agents will never look for us among all these W.A.S.Ps", I had something else in mind.
You said, "BEHAVE?"
You're not the only one who gets to be queen bee.
If you kiss me I turn into your ex-husband's CPA.
I did for you, Honey!
It's okay. It's like being back in the womb.
The latest buzz is that in Italy they are calling him 'Il Douche.'
The queen says buzz off.
well, you told me that I needed to get organized
In here, I'M Queen
You've never heard of 'hiving'? It's all the rage in Europe.
Will you declare for house Apis, in this game of drones?
Yes, I know I'm WASPy, but we can still have a deep and meaningful relationship.
Stop calling me, "Honey," and get me out of here.
I combed my hair.
Never heard of a Man Hive before.
I want to be you honey for the rest of our lives.
Honey, done!
I may have misrepresented myself on JDate and for this I apologize.
I wished for a honey pot
It's not you, it's me, honey.
You can tell your Mom it's none of her beeswax.
You must bee-leaf me.
Can't beat the rent.
It's all part of the 'waggle-dance' weekend.
I don't know what's causing me to have hives.
My DNA profile said I was 90% WASP
This wasn't on the honey-do list?
I told you there was a buzz around me.
How did I get to be king bee? Have you watched Game of Thrones?
Honey, I know we have pollen on hard times, but really, it is none of your bees knees where I call comb these days. Hive made my decision. Buzz off.
Honey, I only wished to shrink the kids!
You're getting warmer...
Because I wanted to be alone. Please just buzz off, honey.
Honey, I'm all a buzz for you
Yeah, but the HOA fees are very reasonable.
Okay fine, I guess you can get a drone.
Subtil? You want subtil? I'll give you subtil.
Darling, I'm beewitched!
Gosh, Chip, I had no idea you were that kind of WASP.
No it's not 'Oh ~ just like Pooh Bear.'
I just wanted to bee inside.
"Honey, hive always loved you with all my beeing".
It's none of your beeswax who I hang out with.
I came for the dancing, and stayed for the honey...
It's what makes our craft brewed meade different from all the wannabe's.
Yes, Honeybun, but it gives me a buzz.
I'm learning to beehive myself.
I'm in a sticky situation.
You're probably wondering why I asked you here.
I think we should start seeing other things.
Honey, they did it again
You told me to gain new perspectives!
I'm trying to get more matches on Bumble.
Let me guess, you want me to call you "Honey".
It's a little cramped,but it's got great airbnb potential.
Yeah, this is an extreme tiny house.
Seems the boss was right. I AM a drone.
Bee stings always make me break out in hives.
No, I will NOT be a Pinata.
Too soon?
Mind your own bees-nest.
I said "BEHAVE" not "BEHIVE"!
Get me down from here & please quit calling me honey.
Did you say "fuzz" or "wuzz"?
Dear, when I said get us some honey, I meant from the store.
It was a summer special on Air BnB!
It's always "honey this, and honey that."
No, we're wasps. The yellow jacket club is down the road.
It's listed at 1.5 million. What do you think?
After reading about the “7 benefits of honey” in the Manly Man’s Magazine I decided to listen to their advice of immersing my entire body in a beehive. After all, what could be more manlier?”
But Janet, can't you see that I've changed?
I told the Genie I wanted to be with my honey.
You asked me to give you a buzz.
I only do locally sourced, non-GMO organic.
It's not you, it's me. I just have a hard time getting close to people.
I got a sublet.
I was told you could direct me to the Appian way
And you complained about my facial stubble.
Hive you seen Beatrice walk by?
Whas'p?
This is what happens when hives go untreated.
Not really the queen, not really a drone.
You catch more honeys with flies.
You said you only date WASPS.
Can I be done with the honey-do's now?
And before I realized what they were doing...
I'm so sorry, Catherine, I know you were hoping I was a Catholic
May I call you, Honey? The name's been on my mind.
It's so you'll call me honey again.
Can I atleast upgrade to the doghouse?
What do you mean you don't like the way I'm beehiving!
Well, they're the bees' knees now
"Give me a quick kiss as I so busy".
Mom says you're not WASPY enough.
It'll be great. They need a new queen, and I'll just be a stay-at-home drone.
You'll always be my queen, too, but this one WANTS to lick jelly off my butt.
Buzz off, Lady.
They've accepted me as one of their own.
I think I know what's causing the buzzing in my ears."
I was just trying to get some honey
?I'm sorry Sally but it's over. My heart belongs now to the queen bee."
I told you, I am in a wasps nest !!!
They want somebody from the outside to run for president of the colony.
I only said "President Trump may be good for the country."
I sold my tiny house.
What did you think I meant when I told you my family were a real bunch of wasps?
Will you hive me?
I can't think of a thing to say.
I've decided not to be.
Now all we need is the birds.
I did well in the Bird course, but I can't date until I pass the Bees course, too.
Can't you see we're busy? Milton T. Jefferson
Isn't this what you meant by hive mind?
WASP privilege
I'm really a prince. Kiss me and I'll be your honey bee and take you to a real swarm.
Well, are you employed at least?
I work for her now.
I never thought face of death could be so sweet.
Come bowling with me in the basement.
I shouldn't have teased them.
you said "let's spend our anniversary where we first met, honey"
I like the bee's-eye view.
Sorry, but you look nothing like your Tinder photo.
Next time I would prefer the dog house
Buzz off, Sweetheart!
Hanging Out With Wasps .Does Not a W. A. S. P. Make.
Yes, I must be in over my head.
I don't think I am your type.
It's a sticky situation.
Really? You're telling me how to wear my hair?
The Airbnb is exactly what you expected.
You gotta feel this buzz.
The new place is great, but I'm still having problems with the wifi.
"Hive gotta crush on you, Sweetie Pie."??
I'm one of them now.
I belong with the swarm now. They freed me from the rugged individualism of my past.
I'm buzzworthy.
That's right, not until 2020. I feel safe in here. You and the kids are welcome to join me.
Too WASPy?
This doesn't make any sense. I'm Jewish
Your look is kind of a buzz kill.
Buzz around town is, this the best way to get fresh honey.
What? They made me Queen.
Maybe you shouldn't have told me "You go behave now" in your commanding Southern accent
I know some people have a problem with the wasp thing, but I really believe we can make it work
Go forth and pollinate.
They call it the Singularity but that's just buzz.
I may have exaggerated when I told you I was only an "office" drone.
I self identify as a queen bee now.
Hi. Im Buzz.
I'm sorry, but you're just too WASPy for me.
Can you just let me bee?
They are all out, do you want some jam?
White Anglo-Saxon protestant. Are you sure?
Can you go to Prom with me?
None of your beeswax Honey.
What do you mean I'm a "white anglo-saxon protestant"??
I asked the genie to make me a well-hung Honey magnet.
Once I get the confidence of the queen, we won't have to worry about rising honey prices ever again.
Honey, I'd rather sleep in the garage.
Have the Willmeirs left?
Saving so much on rent really takes the sting out.
Want to hear the latest buzz, honey?
I hear this helps prevent empty nest syndrome.
What do you think it is? It's a manhive.
I'm working on my comb-over.
No, I don't want to talk about the birds and the bees.
That's because there IS a buzzing in your ears.
Hives get me.
But her emails!
I'm installing Hillary's server.
Go my Queen, explore the world. I promise to “beehive” well in your absence.
At least here, my droning has value.
You'll do anything to get me to call you honey again.
Approach and Bee Herd.
I had to hide in here, the West Wing staff made it to the bushes first
It's a tight fit, but we're expanding to another hive next week.
don't call me Honey again
Then I said, "Spells?, spells? Are you kidding? Buzz off!"
Darling, I'm afraid we must stop meading like this.
You catch more bees with honey, honey.
Look what you've stirred up.
It doesn't have to bee this way.
Actually, I serve a new queen now.
You're killing my buzz.
I love the buzz!
Will you marry me and be my queen?"
You have Lilly Pulitzer dresses, this is the kind of waspy that makes me feel good.
Congratulate me Honey, I'm the new Queen.
Sorry,I'm busy tonight.
I am now One with the Hive.
You're my true amore... She may be Queen but she means nothing to me.
Don't think I'm going to help you comb that out.
Tell Max the bees say it wasn't the Russians hacking, it was KAOS
We're over. Buzz off.
It's okay, I've always known you're a WASP.
Mom didn't mean it when she called you a wasp.
I can see you
My allergist said it's hives.
I'll give you a buzz when I'm not so busy, honey.

Be that as it may, I'm not impressed by all the buzz I've heard about you.
I hear drones are all the rage these days.
Honey, why are you- oh.
I just want to bee.
Just let me be honey.
I think I still have the tinnitus, but way fewer hives.
Sorry, but you're not my kind of honey.
You can't imagine how busy a pollinator I'd bee if only my arms were freed...
Sure my criticisms may be stinging, but I'm a sweetheart on the inside
Don't worry. The hive's gender neutral and I've been chosen as their queen.
Honey is an excellent moisturizer.
I was thrown off Twitter. Now I have to buzz on Hive.
Would you be mine, could you be mine, won't you bee my neighbor?
You stole my honey, Buzz off!
I bet you think I'm a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant...
And all this time I thought I was Jewish.
All I did was wear yellow and black and they took it from there...
So, why did you tell me to make a beeline home!?
The agent said it was a fixer-upper and I could trade up to a hive eventually.
Honey, there's something I have to tell you...
I can't be alone right now.
Marge, you're buzzkill
Maybe, but here I am the uncontested queen.
...yes, Sweetie?
Well, you didn't have to go this far! I won't compare you to your mother ever again. Please.
My mother always said: if you can't beat 'em, join 'em" "I'm calling your mother.
I was hired to scare the bears away.
My profile did mention my drone hobby.
I'm moving out but will give you a buzz sometime.
I connected with the hive mind for a place to live, and now I'm hive-minding.
I thought you liked cocooning?
Do you hear that buzzing sound?
Can't you just ever leave me be?
A Brazilian Bees-Wax is my specialty!
Its really none of your beeswax.
I think we should go back to the car, can't you see I'm breaking out in hives?
Now for the shtick about the birds!
Not until he says he's sorry.
I don't care if bees do it!
We have to quit meeting this way.
I'm going out on a limb here, but I think this hive-mind thing is overrated.
Wow you look even better than your BDate profile picture
I got a great deal on this Air Bee and Bee.
It's just our regular life cycle. I go straight from here to Exeter.
Just them I'm sick.
Well, YOU never want to socialize anymore!
Did I get stung? Are you serious?
I'm rebirthing - don't bother me.
It's small but there's a honey of a view.
Even now, who's the REAL queen bee?
we are trying to save the bees, not the human race
This is not what I had in mind when I suggested summering on the Vineyard.
Um...honey, a little help please?
It's a living
Yas Queen!
I just had to see what the buzz was all about!
Ever feel like you have a few too many bees in your bonnet?
I prefer the dog house.
I hate that acronym.
Yes, the position of Queen Bae is still open.
They said the bees do it you know.
Everyone is always telling me to bee happy. Until now, it confused me.
Heard the latest buzz, sweetheart? The talking pinata...yadda...yadda...
I'm actually wondering if you can tell me who does the illustrations for your contributors. I've tried asking many times but haven't received any response. Thanks! Sharon Hart
I'll be waiting for you.
You owe me fifty bucks.
I'd take panties in a bunch any day...
Sure, it's a studio, but it has a Central Park view!
I'm downsizing AND helping my local pollinators
So the films have dried up since the Wicker Man?
Mirror, mirror on the tree, who is as ugly as can bee?
I found it by googling all the Air BnBs in this area.
Oh, I'm just another WASP from Connecticut
She only dates WASPs.
I found it through Airbnb.
Honey, I just wanted to see what all of this insider buzz was about.
I will NOT sign up for ballroom dancing!
Honey, you're not the only one that stings.
It feels weird when you call me "honey".
I'm sorry I messed up. Forgive me and I'll promise to Beehive in the future.
When you said "bee-hive honey" instead of "behave honey" you were just taking advantage of my tinnitus, weren't you?
Bee the change you wish to see in the world.
Me? Playing hard to get? I have no idea what you mean.
Well, you insisted on only dating a WASP!
I'm relaxing and not interested in the honey-do list today
Okay, fine. I'll call an exterminator.
No, thank you, Susan! But I have finally found a colony who can accept me for me. So, I speak for everyone here when I say, "buzz off...please"!
Sure you want to wear that?
You're Right, it's tight and noisy, but, as a med student, it's the most I could afford"
Mother won't let me out until I finish my chores.
Can't you see I am beezy?
Sweet print.
Bee-headed
Does this hive make my butt look big?
Yes, of course I also have Anglo-Saxon heritage.
I said you need to be more empathetic NOT you need to empathise more with bees
So, I've downsized, but I get free honey.

It's none of your beesness.
$2000 a month but the landlord pays utilities.
Hive-Guy: Hark, kind woman! Prepare for a tale of wonder, love, treachery, and how I came to be in this peculiar state... Woman: Quit bumbling around and just give me some honey!
Inquiring hiveminds like to know.
It's obvious you're just humble-bragging.
I repeat: BUZZ OFF!
I never said "White Anglo-Saxon Protestant."
Out here, no one cares that I'm white, anglosaxon and Protestant.
She's my queen now!
I was cocooned by the B-Alien.
At least they don't sting as much as your mother's tongue!
I'm not sure I can live up to the expectations you have for this relationship.
Know anything about birds?
Well, you told me we should get into the drone business...
A bee, or not a bee, that is the question.
You make me hornet-y.
I know I come from swarm mentality but the truth is they've really encouraged me to be my own person
We can never bee

The witch warned me not to call her "honey".
I'll give you ten good reasons why I'm up here. Number nine will shock you.
Consider it a move from one queen to another.
Compared to a studio apt. in this neighborhood, its a pretty sweet deal.
Beekeeping can have its challenges.
Sure I get stung a lot, but the fresh honey is worth it.
I was minding my own beeswax, like you said, and then this happened.
...well I suppose it makes more sense than current foreign policy?
Please let me bee.
Sorry, I can only tell you about the bees.
Actually, they're NOT more afraid of you
Should anyone ask, you have seen neither hide or hair of me.
They told me to bee, bee all you can bee.
Clearly, you do not understand the bee's nest I am in.
Buzz me later, Honey. Right now I have to hive away.
How about a little sugar, honey?
You should have been more specific about what kind of queen you wanted to be
She doesn't call me an insect.
Wait, you asked me to "behave"?
Yes, but it's rent-controlled.
Honey, what are you doing?
I leaned in.
The honeycomb structure makes it more spacious than it looks.
Such a deal, only fifty bucks a month and all the honey I can eat.
Yes I'm a wasp and your Jewish but I still think it can work out for us
Fine. I'm the head of a WASP fraternity. But does that really mean I'm too entitled for you?
Sorry, I'm kinda buzzed . . .
If you can't beat them, join them.
The new repellant seems to be working.
You just wait honey. Payback is a Beeeach.
Then why did you swipe right?
It's my safe space.
Can I be your honey again?
So you're saying your PMS is over?
You've hung out long enough. Now come inside.
I kept asking myself, "To bee or not to bee." and.................here I bee.
Did you bring the honey ?
Checking out the hive mind.
The buzzing blocks out the fake news.
And you keep complaining about the bee in my bonnet!
Rub me three times and you'll see!
I'd ask you in, but I haven't cleaned and there's honey everywhere.
It's over, just let me bee.
I thought you were my honey, but this is ridiculous
Eating all of that honey made me break out in a hive.
I've joined a WASPy enclave.
Why do you say our relationship isn't going anywhere?
To be a bee or not be a bee. That is the question.
You definitely have the hives.
To get a head, I had to bee ahead
Okay, I will marry you but I first have to know if you are a Worker or a Drone.
Maybe I shouldn't have told the Genie to buzz off...
Location, location, location
I don't think this relationship is going to work out, whenever I am near you I break out in hive!
I told you, unless your are willing to join the hive, we have no more to talk about.
I remember my father saying, "interpretive dance? What will you ever use that for?"
I have intimacy issues
Im being held hostage by the anti-nicotinoid hive!
The Queen has agreed on a deal but Worker profit-sharing demands are exorbitant!
I took your advice, dear. Tomorrow, I'm hanging out with the birds.
What do you want? I'm busy as a....well, you know.
I'm embracing my inner ethnocentrism.
They and I have bonded in ways you will never understand.

Why, yes, I DO think I'm the king bee.
Now honey... I just wanted to be the first to hear the latest buzz.

Bee kind. I can explain.
Stay outta my beeswax.
That's the last time I book from airbnbee
Hi, I am President Trump's Foreign Policy.
I'll be out soon.
Don't ask!
But Carl did the same thing and he got a doghouse!

They say as soon as I see the Queen I can go.
It's none of your beeswax!
I wanted to see how it was being a WASP
I love you, Honey.
We could never truly be together if I only knew about the birds.
Do you mind if I call you 'honey'?
I think it was the Round Up
I know I swore to honor and serve only you, but she coats her demands in honey.
Why do we call each other honey?
Okay, Hive Mind. I am going to Sausalito. Any restaurant recommendations?
If you kick me, a book and movie deal is likely
No, I'm not a WASP. And I don't think that's an appropriate question.
When we talked about my roots, I may not have mentioned that "wasp" wasn't capitalized.
I think you better call the Rosenberg's and tell them we're going to have to cancel, again.
I can't see you anymore. I need to date someone more WASPY.
Will you Bee my valentine?
Next time we buy honey!
You might have to go to IKEA without me.
Is it because you're a WASP?

....and I could get a good look at a T-bone by sticking my head up his butt, but I took the butcher's word for it.
My friends call me Buzz.
Love hurts.
You should have been more specific about your 'queen for the day' wish.
Don't call me 'Honey' -- just get me out of here!
Yes, you're seeing a buddy in bag being buzzed. It wasn't my cartoon.
Well, I don't know what to tell you. You knew what to expect when you married me.
"Enough with the bee jokes"!
It's not a bad gig really, except when the queen can't find a drone.

Thought I'd try the hive mind for date ideas.
I find it warm and buzzy.

Just leave me bee, honey.
Am I bee-coming?
Can we get a doghouse? Please!
