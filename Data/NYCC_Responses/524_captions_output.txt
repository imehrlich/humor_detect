Boy, am I glad you don't subscribe to HBO.
You're right, Puff, this is tons more fun than playing it online!
YOUR mom has dragon breath.
Dragon could not help think the DNC rigged the rules.
You're doing it wrong.
Why do I get the feeling you're holding something back?
No, no, no.......how will you ever become a great swordsman if you always resort to fire breathing to solve your problems?
Do you REALLY need that sword?
The flight restrictions and fire emission standards have really given you a shot in the arm
It's not so much the heat as it is the humidity
Remember, the use of fire is illegal.

No more dragonfly jokes dude!!
Is this becoming a drag-on you?
You are so predictable - thrust, parry, engulf with flames.
Quit calling me 'Little Jackie Paper.'
I shall defeat thee, windmill!
Enough - we agreed on a fair fight!
You have to admit, this is a much more civilized way to kill.
You suck at fighting. Perhaps you should get a job doing short-hand.
Next time I get fangs, horns, and fire breathing and you get the helmet and shield.
Would this vassal be included on the South Breach Diet Plan?
Your short arms are no match for mine

Will the angry mob be staying for dinner, sir?
Honestly? I'd probably go back to breathing fire.
Float like a butterfly!
An old flame hired me to take you out.
Not so brave without your flames, are ya?
Never agree to rock, paper, scissors when deciding how to fight.

Do uoumwant to stop for a smoke
Never mind "fuming" - where's that fellow Maximus and my promised five shows a week?
I, for one, think it's wonderful that you've given up smoking.
1). I've come to ask for your daughters hand in marriage sir... 2). I WIN!... Now fly me to the beach... 3). Let me see if I understand... You want me to relight your fire...
HBO ordered another season....so pardon my cockiness
If you want a 7th season, you're going to need to work with the other dragons and gain more fan appeal. Right now you're polling low.
Next time I pick the dueling weapons!
How do you like me now?
Don't forget there's a ban on use of fire due to the drought.
You told this was a fight to the death!
Why do I bother?
Are you sure you closed the window.?
I realize it's too lat, but I thought you might appreciate my idea fir last week's contest: "I don't think you should order an more Aps for your phone until your typing improves."
It's General Jackie now, Puff, and I rule Honnah Lee.
There we are; that's how you fight like a proper gentleman. Now, where are your womenfolk? I wish to rape them.

This is nonsense. I'll just pay the emissions tax.
No more breath mints..
One of these days, Little Jackie Paper, one of these days...
Again, thanks for tipping the 'scales' in my favor.
Stop resisting and come with me, you've been determined to be a flight risk.
You do realize that this "short arm" thing isn't really going to help you.
What do you mean it is a fair fight...all I have is BAD breath!
OK, on the count of three you thrust and I parry.
You are causing this duel to Drag on.
You would not be so out of breath if you would quit smoking......
Best of all, this reduces your carbon footprint.
Touche or Flambe?
The Game of Thrones writers finally hit rock bottom.
Not fair! We're in a no smoking zone.
I should've brought a pen.
This is a non-smoking land.
You do know that smoking could kill you?
Sorry if you feel cheated by the flip, but... my choice of weapons!
Can't a knight in shining armour just swipe right?
It's General Jackie Paper now, Puff, and Honnah Lee isn't big enough for the two of us.
There will be no 'second debate'
Wow--I didn't realize you had opposable thumbs.
Give me back my pants, you!
My sword is bigger than yours.
Stop complaining. You chose the weapons the last time we dueled.
So the plan is you will take a dive in the 7th round.
You call this a workout? Cmon, make me feel the burn!
What do you mean by that? You knew I was in the monkey business when I married you!
You fight like someone with small hands.

Aaaargh, global warming bullcrap.
Say it right! It's pronounced "sord", the 'w' is silent!
"Scorched earth policy"? No, what does that mean?
That's not what I meant when I suggested we warm up.
You've lost your fire old boy!
New emission standards hit the battle field.
My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
Because you never pick up the check.
This STILL seems unfair. Maybe if you switched arms?
It's great that we don't keep score and everyone gets a trophy at the end.
Although he still hated the knights, Puff had lost his "fire in the belly" for a fight.
Looks like you don't have any fire left without your mama, Daenerys, at your side
By George, he's got it!

Don't blame me. You're the one who said no fire, no wings and no tail.
A sword? Are you kiddin' me? This punk should be toasted -- not shishkabobbed.
I see you're cutting back on carbon emissions.
Well at least I have a better reach.
The funny thing, you huge smoking beast, is I am actually right handed!!!
You wanna learn to parry and thrust...or are you just blowing smoke?
I didn't mean to wake you
If we work together, we could make shish kebob.
I put a smell on you.
I know something you don't... I am not left handed.
You're bulking up well, Dragon. Next week we work on your left arm.
Please calm down sir, your call is next in the tech support queue. Or press 3 to hear "Puff the Magic Dragon" while you wait.
An electric sharpener works better
Very honorable of you, Sir Dragon, to allow me the choice of weapons.
Your lucky for the Game of Thrones contract forbidding fire-breathing off set!

Gimme a break ! 10 ft. taller and ZERO reach advantage !

I despise second-hand smoke.
Good news! Smoking won't be the death of you.
Coward! Fight me with your little hand!
Lets do 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' instead.
Sorry to do this Pete, but that book was fiction.
"You'll be thanking me the next time your furnace is down".
Don't call me dragon breath, you conehead!
Why do you always pick on me? I told you, my name is Puff!
I'm hoping the concept will be picked up by HBO!
Just some honey and tea when its raw. And rest.
While I have you on reach, you clearly outmatch me on breath.
As your leader, I will train you to resist your natural abilities and intuition. We will rely on our revolutionary new sleeveless armour and mini shield to conquer our competition.

So What, you lost the toss and I chose the weapons.
"You're lucky you are friends with Khaleesi!", said the Dragon.

You'll feel a bigger sense of accomplishment if you beat me on my terms.
For the last time...I win the coin toss, we fight on MY terms.
Hey, I'm not the one in charge of regulating carbon emissions.
Call me 'Puff' one more time and I'm running you through.
Wait, was I the next surprise character death, or you?

You know we have a zero tolerance for pollution!
Fine, I’ll use the sword and won’t breathe fire if you'll tell your therapist to start using a different metaphor. I’m tired.
I suppose you want a bigger sword?
Hey, no smoking!
Proof that not everyone watches Game of Thrones.

Me smokin hot... en garde you prurient knave!
A deal's a deal. No slingshots, no fire.

It went on like this for another few minutes, then the dragon simply cooked and ate St. George.
Extinct? I'll show you who's extinct, George!
Because I'm a white male!
I know it's a bad habit, but I love to play with my food.
Very considerate of you, old boy, not to blow you smoke in my direction.

I slay you this time and you breath fire on me next time.
En garde, Monsieur Puff!

I just meant I'd 'slay you' with my jokes.
The Vindaloo Pork plan didn't work, so this will have to do.
It really isn't fair you don't have a shield.
See now? Isn't this more civilized?
Stupid knight! I will defeat you and save the princess!
Your dueling skills are an embarassment.
I picked the wrong day to quit smoking!
Though enraged that the dragon never picked up a check, Saint George turned the short arms to his advantage.
Have you got fire in your belly?
Trust me, I think this would work out better if you had a Snickers bar.
True, but you must admit emission control regulations have improved air quality.
So ....why did you think I was a wolf who lived by the bay
Come on, we'll do it your way tomorrow!
That's right and I'm not bragging, I'm more fierce than any dragon!
NO FAIR !
Puff the Magic Dragon isn't so magical after all, is he?
Just wait until my mom lets me use fire.
"Puff," huh? Well then, light my fire!
I can't believe this is what it takes to get a pair of Beyoncé tickets.
Come on honey, it's all spelled out in the pre-nup.
How many times do I have to tell you - NO SMOKING within 30 feet of the castle!!!
I think I'm going to use this as my profile pic.
Back off! I'm an endangered species you idiot!
Don't be such a technophobe.
I lost it playing Rock, Paper, Scissors.
Hey there Mr. Dragon! I'm gonna have a barbecue next week, can you come and roast the burgers? But first let's try to get along.
Realizing he had forgotten both shield and helmet, the ferocious Smorgy was no longer sure of his chances against Sir Fancypants.
You know, if you wait until tomorrow, I'll be extinct.
Fair and square. We Rochambeau'd for who gets to choose the weapons and I won. Get over it.
This is the last time I agree to be in one of these fake reality shows.
Grendel . your mother is so fat ..she broke her scale .
Me trying to fight off the responsibilities of life
Nothing personal. It was either this or visiting the in-laws.
Are you sure I can't interest you in a quick game of Rock, Paper, Scizzors?
Winner gets the last slice!
This guy really burns me.
Puff immediately regretted taking the whole bottle of antacid.
Et tu, Brute?
Okay, that's a mistake. You have to know your opponent.
I know you’ve used all your carbon credits, so don’t even think about it!
And that's how I met your mother of dragons.
How about we arm-wrestle instead? Left arms only.
Not sorry about your sore throat .
You said you quit smoking.
I told the King that you were a good sport.
Quit complaining, Puff the Moody Dragon...
I practiced first on world of warcraft.
You're not too big to flail.
Why must we always play by his rules?
Man against the world..
The first and last ever play date between man and beast.
Ok, you'll pick the rules for our next fight to death!
You have to widen your stance.
Maybe the song was about pot after all.
Puff, Smokey, whatever. Do something about that dragon breath or I'm going to have to kill you.
Merrily, Sir Galahad continued in gallant swordplay despite a vague, but growing suspicion that his opponent was somehow holding back…
I think I can. I think I can. I think I can.
What do you mean am I going to fight you in this barbute?
This is stupid. How 'bout if I just eat you.
I should have chosen 'breathing fire.'
We fight to first blood, red or green.
No Marijuana here, Puff.
The director wants a retake with more emotion.
Puff all you want. The song was about smoking pot... not you.
Mine IS bigger!
Stop complaining. You got to choose where we had lunch.
Sure, where was that long arm when the check came?
First the can opener, and now this, the knight curses his left-handedness.
As a fire marshall, I am afraid I can not allow this smoking violation to drag on.
Hey little man, the only way I could have a unfair advantage is if you ingested a truckload of TicTacs.
Hi, Donald, I'm Hillary!
Thanks for accommodating. Been sitting a little too long at the Round Table lately.
Ha! Fooled you into a no smoking zone!
Puff's reputation was quickly ruined after Jackie brought him to show and tell.
Peevish knave! How dare you suggest our fights always drag on?
Do you want me to wait while you get a shield?
You know what they say about having short fingers.
Okay, now you teach me fire-breathing.
Bad breath, what did you have for lunch?
Can't do much with those tiny hands, can you?
Grrr...you're using stainless steel and *I'm* the dinosaur?
Welcome, everyone, to the Season premiere of "Dancing with the Reality Stars"
Beware, foul dragon. This scene was scripted by Disney.
I can't believe we use the same blacksmith.
My name is irrelevant, prepare to die.
Not happy with the ban on asymmetric warfare?
Don’t complain – I’m right-handed.
Hey, that's unfair...why does he get a shield?
Breath mint?
8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3...
How to slay a dragon..... have them follow the rules.
Next we'll practice breathing exercises.
I said, 'I declare a THUMB war!'
I'm so glad that we signed that ceasefire.
My dragon pose is very relaxing
Now to see if my Paleo diet works.
You called me 'garlic breath'? Them's fighting words!
On guard He Who Never Learned How to Breathe Fire!
It's not as much fun when it's an even fight, is it?
Pardon me. Do you have any Grey Poupon?
Wait - You're left handed?
The day shish kabob was invented.
Stop complaining. You got to choose the weapons last time.
The Donald and The RNC
Swords for two, but I assure you, mead for one.
Game of Thrones...Final Season 12... Episode 10...Last Scene
Now remember, you take the dive in the third round.
Usually I have a bit more fire
Yeah, and you got small hands too!
Anyone can give you a good fight.
Why, oh why, do I fall for that bargain basement brand lighter fluid every time?
I must warn you, I trained in college.
You forgot the password again didn't you?
Leave my son alone!
I'm going to help you quit smoking, even if it kills me!
Aw..w..w. Look who got out of the wrong side of bed this morning !
Let's quit! We are mismatched hands.
If you think this is futile, imagine jousting.
I shouldn't have taken that Zantac earlier.
If there's no damsel, I'd as soon live and let live.
May I ask if fire-breathing is permitted?
C'mon! Put your heart into it! Show some spark!
Hell of a day to catch a cold, hey?
Calm down, we can recycle our rubber swords.
Admitting you have an anger problem would go a hell of a long way toward ending global warming.
"My horoscope forewarned me I'd have an encounter with a flying ovoviviparous pyromaniac today!". "Yeah? Well, mine told me I'd be having an undersized and pretentious sesquipedalian for lunch".
Damn Geneva Convention
Inter-species symmetrical warfare is so refreshing!
Puff tries to lower his carbon footprint
I'm a lefty. You may be screwed.
You said, "Choose your weapon!"
When we are done with your lesson you're teaching me to breath fire, right?
When pokemon fight back
That's 's it! Forget PC. I'm going with the Trump "no-holds-barred" fight.
You're my new low cost exercise program.
Don't you realize smoking will kill you?
Seriously? With those tiny arms?
'Fight fire with fire' cuts both ways.
But the scales of justice are on my side.
My name's George. What's yours?
It was said that dragon meat had a naturally smoky flavour.
This is way more fun with the new "no flames" rule - don't you agree?
I should have brought my flamethrower to the swordfight; my hands are too little.
Damn these no smoking ordinances!
This battle shall be quite the tail.
I hate the new safety regulations too.
Do you know what they say about dragons with tiny hands?
On Snapchat he looked more like a teddy bear.
Agreed - you won't breathe fire and I won't make any jokes about your ludicrously small baby hands
I clearly have more delegates than you do...
What part of "Smoke-Free Zone" don't you understand?
Saint George was awarded the Bronze medal in the first Olympic fencing match
Touche my ass!
How dare you call my suit of armor a cute little outfit.
Allow me to humor you before this smoke turns into fire to cook my dinner.
That no-fly zone really backfired.
Relax, I won't let this drag on.
Isn't that just like a dragon? Brings a rapier to a longsword fight.
You are foiled again.
Do you want to play, rocks, paper, scissors?
What if we call it Professional Development?
The very beginning of the Trump family.
There must be an easier way to win a woman's heart.
Here be no smoking!
The early years of motivation programs
Do you come here often?
Ah, Dude, your breath is really gross!
My life coach told me to think of you as a gecko.
I gotta quit smoking...
With you facing tougher emission standards, this could be our last duel.
Make it look real, my trusted wingman, she's in distress.
Look at these hands, are they small hands? I guarantee you there's no problem. I guarantee.
You're the one who called 'rock, paper, scissors.' Can I help it if you do rock every single time?
Phil, I know your in there.
Stop goofing around, you made smoke come out of my nose!
You wouldn't stand more than double a chance if you put that sword down!
I used to smoke too, you know, but I'm so glad I quit and can look forward to a long and healthy life.
"Smoking is bad for your lunges." (This is a correction of a typographical error - please delete the prior incorrect entry under Tracy Florant, Tlyn, tracyhflo@gmail.com. Thank you - teeny tiny font size.)
Next stop for you-- extinction.
It's my first day as a Dragon Taunter, so go easy on me.
In case you hadn't noticed, your claws are untied.
Why can't we just get along? Why must you insist on being so 'dragon-like'?
Let’s be chivalry about this, don’t want you heating up
Damn,you won the coin toss.
Wanna join the King's Guards? Beat me in swords, you are in!
This has been so much easier since the Geneva Protocol.
Parry left. Didn't know I was ambidextrous, did you.
When I imagine dragons it isn't you
You're all bluff, Puff !
Oh yeah? Well, I've seen bigger left arms on a newt.
No, no, no! Your footwork's atrocious! How's the princess supposed to believe you slayed me?
You should stop skipping arm day.
Believe me, less is more.
Et tu, Mother of Dragons
I told you we shouldn't have gotten rid of that barrel.
Actually, most of what I've read says I am supposed to win.
"No", I said. "No Games of Thrones", I said. "I like cartoon caption contests", I said. What was I thinking?
This is ridiculous!
First I shall slay thee with my sword and then I shall be “ draggin’ ” deez nutz nuts across thy face.
I really thought it was a song about weed.
Hey, you lost the bet fair and square. I told you Trump would pull it off.
Puff, it's me!!!
Ungaurd Goliath, even with one arm you lose, my name is David
You challenged, and I chose the weapons. So stop kvetching.
Wow That was a drink!
I'm not worried, cheaters never win
Are you sure you're Puff the Magic Dragon?
I don't think there's any good ending to this.
Dude! Time to party like it's 1599!
I heard your 3 boys got jobs over at HBO?
Code Duello my ass!!!!
You should know that Saint George was my third cousin twice removed.
Your little hands are no match for my superior firepower!
They TOLD me this would all be CGI....
Lay down your weapon and surrender peacefully.
We've been at this for a while now. When are you gonna teach me to breath fire?
Back in gladiator scouts I learned that rubbing two sticks together will produce a spark that we can get to your mouth for a relight.
Well, you knew Steve would give you indigestion.
The Bernie-Trump debate.
...And then you hit the "X" button to shoot fire...Now you're getting it, dad.
I'm beginning to suspect this isn't the way a dragon is supposed to fight a knight.
I said, no smoking!
Saint George! You're the guy that slew my Pa!
This raw diet is entirely too much work!
Bernie! Hilery!
If my pilot light hadn't gone out, you'd be toast already.
...sliced, medium rare or well done...your choice
Well now, suddenly this feels terribly unfair.
Oh, c'mon. I agreed to pretend your weren't imaginary.
Next time will not be in a No Fire Zone.
Dragon, shmagon--I always wanted to be a knight!
Have you ever heard of David and Goliath?
Hey, LOTS of dragons have projectile dysfunction.
And so is your sister!
I hear you taste like chicken.
This is your last battle "Lefty.
I can't be the only one parrying.
Use your head! Don't use your head!
Where is the princess? I'm here to save her!
Sure, you've got short arms, but I'm actually right handed.
The Queen is scared to fly but, if you want her, she's yours.
I hate these new government regulations!
My kingdom, my rules.
George, now that's a wimpy name!
Would you like fries with me?
Did you get that shield at Bloomies,on sale?
Would you like some fries with me?
Keep frolicking or no more strings and sealing wax for you!
Oh, you gonna call your mommy?
So after this, will you teach me how to fly.
Of course it's fair! I'm fighting left-handed!
Remember, I had the choice of weapons.
Flameout!! Now I gotcha.
Puff the magic dragon was beginning to wonder if little Jackie Paper was as flammable as his name implied
Wait a minute, when did you get opposable thumbs?
It was bad enough that Puff could no longer breath fire, but being hemihypertrophic meant he was constantly getting picked on.
That never worked for the big bad wolf
Sword shops really need to do better background checks.
What did you expect .... a slingshot?
Go with the left if you want, I'm sticking with the right.
Maybe if you did Crossfit you could become a real firebreather.
Aren't you supposed to be at the studio next door for the PBS Special?
I wish I had a pen!
On guard Puff, I'm more magical than you think!
Why aren't you using your fire?
Next round I get to choose the weapon.
I warned you not go to the climate summit.
No fair! You have a shield!
Okay, if you let me win, I'll read your novel.
" I didn't know we were fencing in costumes"!
Hold on, the manager wants to send in a right-hander.
"OK, no fire but everyone knows, smoke is deadlier. OK, no fire, but the second hand smoke will kill you!
All right, next time you can choose the weapons and open both eyes.
Surely we can agree to differ.
The show must drag on.
See how much more fun this is!!
I just said your hands are surprisingly small.
Let's just split the kingdom, okay?
Use your thighs!
Do I smell damsel on your breath?
Aw, come on. Get into it. Spit some fire!
"I always use my left," he replied offhandedly.
We simply cannot co-exist.
Good thing I won the coin toss.
This is why Disney hates dragons... Come up another princess story that involve killing dragons.
Don't blame me - the rules came from Debbie of the realm of Wasserman Schultz.
Well it's only fair!
For the last time, no smoking!
Do you want a shield?
This time make me win, my kids are watching.
I am so ticked off right now! Your the Guy I Met On the Match.com
I wouldn't go over the middle with those arms
We'll swap you out for a real dragon in post-production.
I know you're steamed about the no-smoking laws.
Strings and paper again? Die Jackie!
I shall SLAY you!!!!
Hey, I wanted rock paper scissors - sword fight was your choice !
Hey, don't go medieval on me okay?
What's the matter? Never fought a southpaw?
"To jo to ho" my tail!
So smoking really does stunt your growth!
Just you wait till it's my choice of weapons!
Now don't complain. Putting diesel into your gasoline porridge has made it a fair fight.
This is the last time I left you choose weapons.
If I can't use my bad breath, then you can't either!
Who said, "dibs on swords" controls?
Do you like sushi?
Asymmetrical!
Um, I didn't know dragons had opposable thumbs.
Take it up with the Union, Firebreath. They agreed with these rules.
I should have paid more attention in Dragon Slaying class
I hate these politically correct fights
Now this is what I call a fair fight!
"Nessie--I am your father.
See, isn't this more sporting?
If you're looking for a rules change, you won't get one here.
I'm just doing this to burn calories.
Look at my hands - are they small hands?
Hear ye Dragon, Geneva Convention deems torching thy enemy unlawful combat.
Don't you know that smoking is bad for your health?
What exactly did you expect when you said no to arbitration?
I gave up smoking for this?
survival of the fittest doesnt apply here
I guess we're not Singing in the Rain today.
My mom said I have to be home before dark.
That’s a lot of bluster for someone with such tiny hands.
You're hoarding bit coins?!
" Your arms are Dragon you down".
Sorry about the drought regulations.
This is not what i expected in the medieval times.
Foul beast! Where didst thou get a sword? Only knights wield such blades, and.....oh.
As soon as we finish the fencing lesson we'll move on to hot yoga. I think you will be a natural at that!
Of course the second hand smoke scares me.
ONLY THIS KNIGHT CAN PREVENT WILDFIRES.
Methinks someone has lost the ol' fire in the belly.
A southpaw?! Dammit!
I was only trying to start your pilot light.
"Dragon-Breath" was meant as a term of endearment.
It shouldn't be this hard to get Hamilton tickets.
None of that, barbecue breath! Fight fair!
It's always a battle to stop you from smoking.
You should cover your mouth when you cough.
Great. Another blowhard bully, with curiously tiny hands.
"I'd like to see a little more lunge in your "On Guard".
You're history, George.
You wanted to join the EU, so you have to play by the rules
Ok, fine, in the context of 'fair maiden' it could also have meant beautiful.
Contrary to popular belief, your breath is fragrant!
With my ridiculous shield and your baby arms, we're getting nowhere fast. Let's bang our swords together a few more times then head out to the Fox & Goose for a cool one.
You're remarkably cooperative regarding choice of weapons.
Not one to be easily typecast, Puff auditions for the role of knight #2.
You Brits don't listen, I said I turned vegetarian!
Maybe after this we can play some checkers ?
You're more of a Disney dragon than a Game of Thrones dragon, aren't you?
It's just not your year.
Stop complaining... Proper swordsmanship will come in handy when you've lost that fire in your belly.
See--it's all in the wrist! Now, you try it.
There is an asteroid coming this way and ithas your name on it.
Why do I always have to play by his rules
Hillary! Bernie!
My name is Grendel; got that? Grendel. Not Puff.
Aha! I am not left-handed either!
Journal Entry: Wally the captured dragon showed us their fighting techniques but I am not sure Wally is from their a-team.
My choice of weapons does seem unfair but I'm only using one arm.
Challenging you to a sword fight was ridiculous. I should have stuck with my natural advantages of fire, flight, and a big fast tail.
See, this is so much more environmentally friendly.
And you say that now that you have been rescued from the pet trade, where they clipped you wings and stole your fire, you have to learn how to fight like a man?
Stay away you mighty beast!
Someone dropped out of dragon school...
Hey, it's not my fault you're coming up shorthanded
This is what happens when dragons grow up without fathers.
You can't stop me, Puff! I will make Honalee great again!
I'll bet you taste like chicken.
Dragon to knight "Why don't you pick on someone your own size"
You're toast as soon as they lower the forest fire danger level.
You knew what I meant when I said "fire with fire."
Is-it-be-yond-your-gigantic-dinosaur-capacity-to-understand-my-tiny-human-nature?!
I have a plane to catch.
Roleplay remember, roleplay. Come on!!!
Why are you doing this again?
Everyone is unique in their own ways, but we have all learned the same war.
I can't believe my fire went out and I'm reduced to using this stupid sword! Where can I get more Tabasco sauce?
Determined to rescue the beautiful dragon princess, Shmaug swallowed his fear and set out to slay the terrible Sir John outside his mountain lair.
No, it's your turn to play the dragon.
Intelligence wins over brute force, but you're too slow to realize that!
I've been commanded to put an end to your frolicking
Next time I get to choose what we fight with.
I can't believe she even agreed to pose on your shield!
I can't believe you agreed to sword fighting!
Our crossfit instructor says to hold this lunge for 4 more seconds and that should complete our WOD (Workout for the Day)
I swear I defeated Bowser on the last level.
" Little Jackie Paper ? Yesterday's news .
I can't believe they paired us together. No shoes, no helmet, no shield! I said thrust!!
You don't know much about arms control .
do you really think the viewers at home are going to believe any of this?
This is my first heavyweight fight.
Your fly is undone!
ok little man. Next game I pick the weapon.
To the victor, goes the Princess
I hate it when my pilot light goes out!
C'mon quit Draggin your feet!
The original Tom and Jerry
Danny, you're not you when you're hungry.
Okay, you can be Errol Flynn next time!
You lose a glove ?
Are we almost done?
Listen, would you be willing to kneel as well?
Retraining for burned-out dragons: "That's it--parry, parry, feint, lunge and smoke."
The underdog may become a hotdog after this fight
Ever since guns were banned, dragons have had a harder time protecting their homes
Drat! another bland hors d'oeuvre!
Nope, you are not going to get me to slide down your tail.
Don't make me burn you
best two out of three, first time swords, next time fire...
"Whatcha gonna do about it?" saids the armor guy. "You are dead meat!!" yells the dragon. "You can't kill someone who has been killed before and brought to life".
Don't worry, this won't drag on much longer.
Quick photo-op here, so a couple sword taps before I run like hell!
They said they were from Survey Monkey.
I'm reducing my carbon footprint.
If I don't get you the smoking will.
I'd be much obliged if you switched to your left arm.
Hold your fire, this is a sword fight.
See, that was your big mistake. You should have waited for ME to challenge YOU to a duel FIRST, so that then YOU could have picked "flaming nostrils" as your weapon . . .
Finally, a fair fight!
This what its like taking every english test.
How is this training going to help me survive an asteroid?
I'm teaching you this because you've transitioned from breathing fire to blowing smoke.
Princess? Nah, I'm just here for the Cardio workout.
This is your last fly-by-knight operation.
Dueling the dragon
Now,do you think you could teach me that fire schtick?
My motto, Sir: Épée, Touché, Flambé.
Blowhard. Tiny hands. Republican, right?
What's with the attitude?
Sir Dawkins used the dragon's evolutionary disadvantage against him.
The dragon immediately regretted agreeing to the terms of combat.
Secondhand smoke had strong opponents in Middle-Earth.
Damn Fire Marshal
Fine. I'll fight you with a sword for now but if I sneeze, you are barbeque.
endangered species fights for survival
It's not my fault you lost the coin toss.
What you do'nt know is I am not left handed!
Can we get this dual over with? It's really starting to drag-on.
Do you know what they say about dragons with little hands?
Your more like fill my Kraken.
Sir Jamie busted the myth about dragons liking to sword fight in seventeen seconds.
Well, I couldn't figure out how to fight fire with fire...
Good grief, I meant to grab my pen.
I sense you are ready to fire your primary weapon.
That's my family crest!
Ha, Ha, this is like fighting fire with fire!
Well you are misappropriating my weapon! So let's call it even.
"And if you don't have it looked at soon, you'll get "Lance Elbow".
Get over it. No fire-breathing, new EPA standards.
Hamilton you say...Meet Puff Daddy!
You read the rules. No carbon emissions. Stop fuming.
Your demands for fair play are wearing thin.
I hear ya, Falkor; same with Guenevere; she just won't get off my back about it. Nice lunge by the way.
And then the dragon skewered the knight, breathed fire upon him and enjoyed a nice tasty kabab
Once upon a time a maiden transformed herself into knight when Lo! she met a Republican standing in front of yon bathroom door. . . .
Yes, Hillary! Wall Street's backing does make it a better symbol for Democrats!
'I hate a sword loser."
Don't tell me you're STILL fuming that Peter, Paul, and Mary didn't pay you royalties!?
My doctor said i had strep throat, so I'll play with a sword today
Competitive parity is a fantasy.
Your upper body is weak but great opposable thumb work
Boy, was THAT the wrong number for Hot Wings!
Please dress more appropriately the next time.
Serious Napoleon complex!
Sorry pal, but am going to belch.
Gadzooks, Puff! Is that all you can summon up?
I thought we agreed that if I taught you swordplay you would teach me to breathe fire.
If you put down the sword I'll try to get you an interview at Geico.
There was no budget for dragon fire this year.
Your biggest weakness is your overconfidence.
I told you that you need to fight fire with fire
Your breath smells like kerosine.
Your sword handling skills are quite impressive!
Round One (Steel) was a push. Round Two (Fire) proved a rout.
I know - it isn't fair! But they don't allow open fires.
Hey Puff: lets move this theater to Colorado...easy access, easy puff..
I see you're still smoking.
We'll settle this one without collateral damage.
Knock it off Bernie
Ecofriendly Dragozor chooses not to burn his breath-gas, and instead reuses the cocktail pick from his cherry vodka sour.
Sorry Puff, this is Colorado. You've lost your magic!
Since I have to use my left hand, then you do too!
Have you ever noticed that your right arm is longer than your left?
The conditions of your surrender are non negotiable.
Knight: I shall slay you dragon! Dragon: Let's dance.
Are you still steaming because you lost our arm wrestling match?
Simon says "Hands Up!"
My pluck is mightier than your sword.
C'mon, Puff, get into it. I thought you missed me!
Behind the scenes of How to Train Your Dragon.
No fair. You're using your good arm.
What a time to have a flameout!
You should stop smoking.
Awww...did widdle dwagon wun out of pwopane?
O.K.! One more selfie, and that's it!
If I could breathe fire I would. You're the one saying this wasn't a fair fight.
If you don't blow your smoke on me I won't spit on you.
I see you are running out of steam.
C'mon, you're going to have to improve your backhand!
That's a bit of overkill isn't it?
...and your mamma has dragon breath!
Don't even think about it! Fire danger is "high" today.
I warned you never to call me "PUFF".
I am glad you quick smoking - you will live longer
My kingdom did not cause hay fever just to annoy you.
Best out of seven. No flying, no fires.
George, you're toast if I get this fire going again
I really don't like facing lefties.
Fight like a man.
That crack about your breath was merely a statement of fact.
Quit dragon your feet and fight me dangit!
Just play dead already!
SMILE! You're on Candid Camera.
To be fair, you are the dragon.
Did you ever hear the one about, the enemy of my enemy is my friend?
Remember--we agreed you wouldn't breathe fire if I wouldn't.
En garde, Puff! The Round Table bans smoking
Trump this is Megyn, this is just for the show, you are very strong man, just don't hurt me.
Hey, you could be cleaning moats for your community service.
I'm so glad this is a sword fight to the death and not a magical fire breath fight to the death.
You’re the one who told me that it never hurts to ask.
I need a pen!
Funny - I thought your sword would be bigger.
The first page of George RR Martin’s eagerly anticipated ‘The Winds of Winter’ was a surprise to many.
Excuse me, this is a non-smoking duel.
yes,smoking will make your left arm shorter than your right.
For the last time, I don’t know Dothraki, and certainly did not mean to insult your mother.
No use in huffing. I won the coin toss.
Stop complaining. I don't make the rules.
"En Garde" St. George v. The Two Eyed, Two Horned, Flying, Papal People, Eater
The energy shortage has sure cramped your fighting style.
Hey, you challenged me. I choose the weapons.
You are a formidable opponent....breathing fire, sharp horns, spiked tail. But your thrust and parry are horrendous.
Regardless, the Bards will sing about your sense of fair play.
For such a big talker you sure have small hands.
I didn't know you were right handed.
Feeling your Wheaties, Buster?
Your technique is good but I'm not sensing any fire in the belly.
For all this effort you better taste like chicken.
Looks like somebody needs to hit the gym.
Use your left hand!
Why is your right arm so much bigger than your left?
Geez, Puff! Your breath! Eat a mint!

Nonsense! I gave you the option of bows & arrows.
There's no way I was trying to hit on your sister!
Mom was right. I should have studied harder in school.

It didn't work this way on Game of Thrones!
After this let's play cops and robbers!
Have you tried taking an antacid for that heartburn?
En garde, hellspawn!

Have you ever frolicked in the autumn mist?
There must be an easier way to make a living ?
Ok, we'll lose the swords, but you give me a flame-thrower
Hey, simmer down! Remember, you hired ME to teach YOU sword fighting.
I'd fight fire with fire, but I left my matches at home.
Look ,I'm just stating a fact: you have tiny hands.
You may dress like a Dragon, but you’ll use the Men’s room in this state!
I knew Saint George. You're no Saint George.
Don't you try to smudge you damn new age shadow archetype.

I am a bird. No you're not.
You seem to be dragging today.
I hate battles in a No Smoking Zone
Even frolicking in the autumn mist brings out the haters.
Well, the next time I come to YOUR lair, we can do what YOU want!
Drop it like its hot!

This neighborhood does not need another Chinese restaurant.
No...I'm pretty sure it's I 'slay', you 'slay', but he or she 'slayeth'.

Being vegan made life difficult for Puff.
Stop fuming! You'll get the hang of it soon.
I don't suppose a belly rub would help?

"Game of Thrones" extras let off steam between takes.
Rock, paper, scissors?
Banned from burning fossil fuel... Puff resorts to Plan B.
Why did I agree to nothing above the neck and no fire breathing?
This episode of "Game of Thrones" is really pushing my credibility.

Where did you get the sword? I'm supposed to be the only one with a sword. Darn!
Aren't you glad you gave up smoking and fire breathing?
Young man, let me tell you something I knew St. George & you are no St. George
Remember now. You have to say "Touché!" or it doesn't count.
Not a southpaw, eh?
But you have such tiny hands!
Puff loses his fire; goes draconian...you get the point in this sworded affair.
Since when do dragons have to play fair.

Please, this as a no smoking area.

I see you are trying to give up smoking.
Dude, blowing smoke is totally cheating.
This new handicap rule is a complete drag.
No, I don't have a light.
Time Out! I need a potty break.
Trust me. Fire breathing has become something of a dragon cliche.
I thought we agreed --no Mexican food before the duel.
Puff the magic dragon - NOT!

Scissors!
I can't believe you're still smoking.
Instead of killing me you could turn our conflict over to your God but nooo. The short guy wants to fight and if he wins he wants to be titled as a Saint.
At least if I win, I won't eat you.
Seems like your sword would be a lot bigger, buddy.
When smoke gets in your eye.
Dragonetta, females of your species cannot mimic authentic swordsmen.

I'm St. George. Historically, you can't win.
And I had to say, "Choose your weapon."
Let's pretend: I'm the Ninja Hillary and you're the Evil Trump.
What gas b ill?
Take it easy, I wasn't referring to you when I said small arms.
Dragons live forever, but not so little boys...
No I don't frolic and No this isn't Honnah Lee!
This is what happens when you don't pay your bill.
"Let's take a break and play "Puff!'
Next round, we fight fire with fire.
Thanks for agreeing to fight with swords!
Give me a break, I'm just looking for mushrooms!!!

Don't give me that endangered species crap!
Under armoured. It's the latest thing.
Another Jackie Paper impostor.
Trust me, this is wrong on so many levels.
In days of old when knights were bold and selfies weren't invented
Sword on sword! Finally, fair combat! Thanks, this is MUCH better!
You're DRAGON this out!
Hold the Sword, Hold the Sword.
My name is Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., and your ass is grass.
No, I didn't say your eggs stink. I expressed surprise because I thought you were extinct.
Okay, okay, next time you get to choose the weapons.
OK, but please don't fire me.
Hey! We agreed to do this left-handed.
Some days the dragon wins
My offer to debate is still open.
Remember, if I last more than one minute, I get a date with Kalessi.
I didn't make up the rules. Deal with it.
Ready? On three. One, two....
If you didn't smoke so much you wouldn't be so out of breath .
If this weren't a no-smoking zone you wouldn't stand a chance!
Yes, Hilary, size DOES matter
I need to teach you to read so I can use my pen.
Can we please come up with a secret handshake instead? None of our enemies think we look cool when we do this.
Now you're just showing off.
Don't get huffy, I'm a superdelegate!
At your house, we can play with your toys.
Yo mama's breath is sweet.
"Those liberal pundits will never believe I did this" (Trump)
I keep telling you Game Of Thrones is a tv show!
Fire-breathing is next round.
Don't complain, Smokey! We could have chosen binding arbitration...
Rules are rules. This is a no-smoking environment. I win.
My wife asked for a knight out dueling some thing hot and horny.
I thought these vorpal blades were supposed to work snicker-snack.
I swear it wasn't me who spiked the water supply with Rolaids!
Does your coach know you have a distinctive tell?
I know you're feeling crabby Teddy, but you know it's just your low blood sugar.
Just a little more sparring and then I'll see about the strings and sealing wax stuck up your snout.
I hate to play by the rule.
The smoking ban has been a real game changer.
You'll get used to fighting hand-to-hand. And just think of the carbon credits you'll earn.
The only weapon that will suffice, for a dragon with asthma...
Care for a breath mint?
This won't be a fair fight unless you use your left arm.
Let's have a fair fight Puff: no magic tricks.
Why are you using a sword? You can belch out flames.
Stop huffing and puffing, and start fighting!
I'm not really left-handed either!
I knew the HBO series would diverge from the books, but this seems like a bit of a stretch.
Why the sword---the old flamethrower kaput?
No no! Step left, then right performing counter-riposte!
Then why are you smiling?" "Because I know something you don't know." "And what is that?" "I... am not left-handed.
Your English Lit professor is just plain wrong! Tolkien was the one who said, 'It simply isn't an adventure worth telling if there aren't any dragons.'
I will not drink to excess before a duel..I will not drink to excess...
This way you reduce your carbon footprint.
Look Bernie, THIS is what I would call a rigged fight.
Aha, I see you can't take the irony, my friend.
Are substitutions allowed? I'm not into chicken wings, again.
No time for games Sir! We got a shoot to get to
Just remember, no breathing fire or flying!!
Fair fight? My hands are Trump size!
But it's much more fun to play with your food than eat it!
This is still not as strange as a Trump presidency.
Not so tough in a fair fight, are you?
When you don't use your fire, our fights tend to drag on.
I've got you on my Fantasy Gladiator team.
Fine. I'll put the fire away, but if he thinks we're both getting trophies after this, he's got another thing coming.
Got any bigger friends?
Does this sword make my arms look short?
I could just incinerate you, you know!
I thought you were supposed to br magic, Puff.
You're several million years too late!
How did you get a sword like mine?
You can’t bring a firefight to a sword fight.
You are in trouble. I binged watched Game of Thrones.
After this epic battle we'll be famous and they will name sports teams after us.
It’s a win-win: I get the damsel and later you get to incinerate the village. All you have to do is play dead for a short while.
En garde you flameless excuse for a terrible lizard.
Remember: No smoking during the engagement.
Embrace the dark side, Puff.
Unless that footwork improves, someone won't be getting his giant marshmallows tonight!
Give up now or I tell you the ending to "Game of Thrones."
Dinner is severed.
For the afternoon show, I get to wear the dinosaur costume, and you have to wear these irritating tights and goofy helmet.
Darn't I forgot the can opener
I really need to get an agent who can tell apart dragon from dragoon.
I heard your mother has lips like Mick Jagger!
Hopefully this will be the last presidential debate.
Thanks for stooping to my level.
Don't be so steamed. You got to choose weapons last time.
Who would of thought we would be the last ones vying for the Iron Throne?
That all you got, ya wimpy lizard? C'mon, gimme your best shot!
Oh great, a renaissance dragon.
Yeah, this reminds me of the 2016 presidential debate as well.
Look, I don’t make the rules, starting a fire in the park is prohibited.
Next week I'll bring my flame thrower.
During the early days of failed upgrades.
I still think it's only fair if we both fight left-handed.
So tomorrow, you bring the fire and I'll bring the marshmallows.
You really need to do something about that bad breath.
Talk about casting against type!
... and another thing I dont like about George R R Martin is ...
You wanted to be in the Special Olympics. Now we've got to parry..
I am with you pal, all this CGI is ruining it for everybody.
Smokers Die First!
Hm... And they told me knights exist only in fairy tales.
That's good but work on your thrust.
Easy pal, Puff is alive and well. He lives by the sea in a land called Honnah Lee.
That little hand tells me you're on your way to extinction, mister!
Adults really know how to take the joy out of playtime, don't they?
I agree, but rules are rules.
And now you say "touché!" Isn't this more fun?!
I double dare ya.................
I should never have told him he was adopted.
Call a truce and I'll get you a job at Sizzler.
I never thought I would stoop to your level.
we might have ordered from the wrong amazon
But you got to choose the location.
Sorry, but weapon allocation was decided before the first primary.
Yo Momma of Dragon's so fat...
Between you and me, I've been feeling a little burnt out myself lately.
Now don't pout, old chap. You know very well the new Rules of Engagement state that fire-breathing constitutes unfair advantage.
Well, no I've never done this before, but I'm a successful real estate developer, so I'm highly qualified.
Don't rush. Clear your mind. Become one with the sword.
See! It's always better to have a real skill.
Alas for the olden days when a dragon could really roast an enemy. Thaniks, Obama.
Are you aware that I can fire you at will?
just play along " " Woo Saa Woo Saa
Remember the ground rules. No biting or stomping.
So Ted says: "Now I know you have Hillary, Bernie, the Republican Establishment and probably `The Donald' in your pocket, but just to make it fair, I've decided to take you on Left Handed"`.
Armistice?
Go get him Hillary.
Next time lets play rock-paper-scissors instead.
...99. 100. Now we switch to dueling breaths.
Darn! Now I'm thinking I shouldn't have agreed to level the playing field.
Have you seen any good monster movies lately?
George. Saint George.
Auditioning for the dragon on Game of Thrones requires versatility .
Methinks the wall our King ordered built wasn't high enough.
It's not about size--it's how you use it.
Never insult the length of my arms again
Sir, why don't we lay down our arms and settle this like men?
We're getting to old for this Larry. You're almost in your Middle Ages.
nobody tells me where I can smoke
Me David, you Goliath.
Look, Shorty, there's no epic poem in this for you!
Why oh why did I pick sword fight?
You're lucky I don't have a pen with me.
Could I have a light?
I'm Bernie, You're not!
You have lost your old fire.
I sense you're unhappy with the new handicapping rules...
I see that centuries of smoking has finally diminished you lung capacity.
Hillary and Trump discuss non-proliferation.
How to slay a dragon who never have missed right arm day.
Uh-oh. Never bring a sword to a firefight.
I thought the ad said "learn how to have a flight at night", not "learn how to have a fight like a knight"...
Boy, you have really bad breath!
Dragon Slayer? Well, the twists and turns of the tall tale will make the hero!
On guard! My throat has been sore and so I'll have to make do with this sword.
Come on puff, can't we rekindle just a little of that 60s magic?
Dragon: (snort, snort, fire, giggle) You slay me. St George: That is historically accurate.
You'll be free once I trump this monster, Melania!
lets make this look good, I'm trying out for "Game Of Thorns"
Or...of course, there's always rock, paper, scissors
Stop complaining, you should have picked heads.
Because "buck teeth" is not on the Accepted Dueling Weapons list.
There's not a lot of meat on this little guy, sliced thinly and flashed fried should do.
In time, we'll both be extinct.
Ever try swallowing it?
Looks like someone else is a little shorthanded too!
My name is GEORGE, not Doofess Head, you smelly fish.
You know, "freestyle" is so 1380's.
You shoulda taken 'Truth" kid.
"David and who-liath ??
You cannot win if you're holding back!
I said "Jinx" first-- now keep your mouth shut!
This could drag on all night.
Poor Charlie. He thinks the ban on fossil fuels applies to everyone.
All this just for a job at Medieval Times?
I really thought Game of Thrones was going to phone back this time!
Don't blame me! The rules of engagement are written in Brussels
Touche? Flambe!
No need to get all fired up.
A little breath mint wouldn't hurt, you know...
Spine straight like so, and -- very nice exhale.
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You incinerated my father. Prepare to die.
Hey, I didn't invent the expression "Dragon Breath," I'm just telling you how it is.
No, I don't have a match.
You are in a smoke free zone
Unless you focus on your breathing, it's just sword fighting.
Make a wish.
This fight is really starting to dragon. Get it?
I never played a lefty before!
Sword-farts!
Aghh! It must be another election cycle. You know you're going to be 'toast', don't you?
Two more lessons, Kid, and you can go for your license.
I hope this armor is flame-retardant.
Ah ha! Using the old second-hand smoke as a weapon trick, eh?
'My wife was right - my sword isn't big enough.'
Don't worry--I'll use only one arm, too.
I will never give up my front row bike at Soul Cycle!
You always get this way when you try to quit smoking.
Would you prefer rock, paper, scissors?
I like to play with my food.
Oh be a good sport - you can choose the next game we play.
You make the challenge, I choose the weapon!
The noble rules clearly state that the use of fire shall be strictly prohibited during a sword fight.
That's right, twerp! I took a fencing class! By the way, how are your 'learning to breathe fire' classes going?
It's called a 'reasonable accommodation.'
I know swordplay just ain't cool/ You don't want to play no fool/ But we'll never get to Broadway without rappin' and a duel !
Once I hold up this picture of him as an infant I think he will relax
How many times do I have to show you thrust and parry?
If you were really a "magic dragon" you wouldn't need the sword.
Don't puff with me!
Someone woke up on the wrong side of the shire.
Surely, you jest!
Ah, so all that smoking finally caught up with you.
Huff, the tragic dragon lived by his wits.
Have you been burning the candle at both ends?
Tiny hands, tiny sword. Just as I thought.
You know, e-cigarettes come in a lot of flavors, but I don't think your supposed to eat them.
Parry...and thrust...You got it!
We could avoid all this conflict if you just pop a breath mint!
Uhh... 'Hodor'?!
I didn't say Daenerys wasn't worthy, I just said she's a bottle-blonde.
"Air Quality Management District" sent me.
Lucky for you, I hate cooking.
N--if you get a sword, I should get dragon-breath!
When I slay you it's gonna be HUGE.
Look! I believe it’s Halley’s comet.
Saint George. What's yours?
Hey, we've just started foolin' around and you're already smoking?
Another day, another bully with very, very small hands to take down
I’m going to slit you open from your pitifully scorched nostrils to the tip of your slimy little tail.
You see, chivalry's not so hard, even with those tiny hands.
I asked for my pipe and my flagon, but they brought you, you viperous dragon!
Sometimes I wonder why we even bother to do this anymore.
You think you're hot stuff.
You may not pass. This is a smoke-free fiefdom.
A lefty!?! That's not fair!
No, life's not easy for a boy named Puff.
``Time out! The damn selfie stick fell over.''
I must seek release from my vegan-vows!
my cartoon, my rules.
When we're done, shall I give your regards to Peter Yarrow?
Hey, Big Guy, you need to go to Anger Management
Remember - you wanted to flip for choice of weapon!
And next I’m going to beat you at arm-wrestling.
Want to grab a bite after the show?
Smoking should have stunted your growth.
No doubt about it... I've got to quit smolting....
Ever thought of running for president?
Betcha I can beatcha playing dominos
When you use the word "fair" to describe her, why do I have this creepy feeling you mean fair-to-average?
We agreed that you would use your left.
What evil deed did you do to earn your wings?
Remember! We all have to do our bit to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Oh my god, you're wearing lifts.
"How many times do I have to tell you...it's parry first, then lunge.".
I told you, because of global warming I don't breathe fire anymore
You didn't know that breathing fire is nowadays considered passe?
How many times do I have to explain this? It's cultural exchange, not cultural appropriation.
This was more fun when I could smokem.
My name is George. Have you heard the Good News?
Come on and get it, you big bully!
How many times do I have to tell you? That's not the way to hold a sword.
You're a one-ton dragon who breathes fire—why the sword?
Don't worry. I have a fireproof slingshot
I shall defeat the dragon by locking him to a long-term contract as his Personal Trainer
So you do speak loudly and carry a small stick
You should be used to pointed objects.
Let’s use our other arm.
I must warn you, I’m binge-watching Game of Thrones.
If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kingdom!
There's something I ought to tell you.
Love the knight tattoo on the outsize arm.
Die dragon, die dragon, die, die, die.
Huge Dino loses his temper when someone makes fun of his small hands!
Sure, eliminating gluten from your diet will have its side-effects, but your skin looks marvelous!
Big obstacles, Extra large solutions. I'm a warrior...
Forget it...I am burned out!
You better have brought your best, overgrown lizard.
You win. I'll put the toilet seat down from now on.
Don't forget, I'm supposed to win.
I'd rather play than slay.
Remember, anything below the belt is a foul.
Why don't I come back when your sore throat's better?
Don't think you're too big to fail!
Oh, quit fuming. You get to choose weapons tomorrow.
Face it, the future is video gaming. We are just two more victims of a disruptive technology.
I'm telling you right now that size doesn't matter.
...But Sire , you chose the weapons !
It's settled then. Winner frolics in the autumn mist.
If you kill me, you don´t get the shield!
Why did I sign up for this fencing class.
Now if only I had a pen!
Gotcha! Your pilot-light just went out.
They're changed the rules on me.
I'm glad you're aware of your bad breath.
Mano a...?
I declare, however foul the sulfurous belching, thy small hands doom thee.
After we're done playing...you know I'm still going to eat you.
Oh sorry, I guess you can't put one arm behind your back
It's affirmative action.
How long are we going to let this feud drag-on?
If we play our cards right, we can be stars on "Game of Thrones"!
Ok, once more, and we’ll take a break. This time, keep your wings behind you, and don’t let your opponent make you mad.
Next week we will do the fire-breathing contest.
I come to cut your greenhouse gas emissions
OK, big fella - I promise - next time YOU get to choose the weapons.
Okay, Puff, show me your magic.
One shish kabob coming up!
Ha! Again no shield, again poor swordplay! You stupid overgrown lizards are all the same!
I feel like you're not using your dragon identity to your advantage.
Origin of the phrase, "Armed conflict."
You know you could just eat me, right?
It's against my nature to fight like this.
Are you aware this is a non-smoking venue?
En garde, ready, go!
I'm just so glad your a " people pleaser".
First Rule of Engagement: no fire!
Still better than dealing with the cable company.
Hope I don't need the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch.
Need a breath mint?
How long will this fight drag-on?
You do know you're making a 'huuge'mistake don't you?
Bernie vs Hillary OR vice versa
If you burn my popcorn one more time . . .
Grendel was fuming mad that Beowulf had gotten choice of weapons in their duel.
Think of it as a teachable moment.
You've been warned dragon - this is a smoke free Kingdom
Right it's hard to bring a mythological story to the screen but this is actually doing us more harm then good.
Mithmatch.
Oh stop fuming! You agreed to the rules.
I've warned you before, this is a non-smoking kingdom!
Because your arm isn't long enough to take a selfie.
Fight fair. You know the rules. Shield in right hand, sword in left.
George was thankful for Dragons' renowned sense of fair-play.
Let's see who goes extinct
Tell Lucifer I'm in. Live with it.
Ah....Er....Ah....TOUCHE!
I'll see your 'en garde!' and raise you a touche!
Stupid emissions standards.
My agent says you'll never have to look for work again.
Don't even think of it, I just ate raw garlic.
Early result of no smoking law
I see you're evolving!
No. YOUR Mama.
I bet you can't look between your legs.
You look ridiculous.
Just as I figured. All smoke and no fire.
Yes, I represent the anti-smoking tobacco industry.
...If it wasn't for the no open fires law, your ass would've been fricasseed two hours ago!
That tiny left arm is freaking me out. What are you, half T-rex? Hello! Distracting!
I'm ready to forget our differences. I'm thinking veep.
Lesson learned: Don't bring a sword to a dragon fight!
George couldn't come today.
You were too slow on the counter-parry-riposte. Again!
Well, this brings a new twist to fighting fire with fire
I wanted to puff the magic dragon, not fight it!
What do you mean "Dragon lives matter?"
You have to learn how to defend yourself with a sword, or you will be extinct.
Got GoT?
Live by the sword die by the sword..blah blah blah. Wait till the page is turned
I thought this penis helmet would intimidate you, since your hands are so small.
You must think I used up all my flames on the internet.
My mom said, that your mom said, you have to let me win.
You're killing me with these last minute rule changes.
Looks like somebody didn't bring his A game.
Give another guy a chance.
I thought you lived by the sea.
I guess it'll help my self-defense claim.
Keep spitting fire. This is my warm-up.
You need to work more on your form.
I don't breathe fire, but I had an onion tart for lunch.
What's your handicap?
Dead for a ducat!
After I'm done with you you'll be nothing but a future high emission fuel product.
Am I really limited to just this little sword?
Do you realize that you can be disqualified since we are in a No Smoking area??
I forgot my sling and stone.
You know, they're going to cut our scene from 'Game of Thrones'.
How about if we just chill out and go grill some burgers?
I'm afraid to I must warn you I'm not left handed!
An historical rendering of the infamous battle between the fearless Righty Knighty and the fierce Lefty Lucy.
I give up, what have you learnt to do?
I'm trying to give you an equal opportunity here!
Maybe when your arms grow longer you won't swing like such a dinosissy!
Here's the deal: If I win, you go back to Japan; if you win, I go back to Norway.
Call me 'Little Jackie Paper' one more time, sir, and I will run you through!
I can't believe he fell for the old "choice of weaons" trick.
... I AM your father!
How much longer will this fight drag-on, it's almost knight-time!
Up urs!
One day we'll both look back on this and laugh.
Killin's much easier when your pilot light stays lit.
I know you are, but what am I.
Smoking will kill you before I do.
Similarly descibed, yet no match either!
Okay. Next round, you get to breathe fire while I blow my nose without a hankie.
En guarde! You short fingered vulgarian.
Seriously? I have breath mints in the car.
Aha, I thought it was a toupee, you small-handed, smoke-blowing monster!
First swords, then tail wagging, then fire breathing.
Come on, humor me a little...
Little hands! Little hands!
Notice how the sword brings impressive firepower!
That dragon-slayer hype was just publicity from my agent. Let's go have a drink and settle this some other way.
Nice bingo wings!
Seems a bit unfair, this height advantage of yours.
The winner gets genitals.
Okay, tomorrow we can do flame throwers.
Good things come to those who wait, my friend.
Your not as HOT as you think>
Curry and the Thunder
You better work on that lunge!
I won th coin toss, and I chose swords. Get over it.
It looked much bigger online
my horse has gone for back up
I feel a historical moment coming on
Let's drop the swords and make it an even fight.
T.rex was a wimp
May I suggest a short break for breath-mints?
You're lucky my pilot light is out.
I up your roar with this warrior pose. Namaste.
When you're ready to fight, say: 'Fire!'
Can we play cops and robbers instead?
Hey, I didn't challenge you - you challenged me - you can't use your fire.
It was self defense!
Opposable thumbs will never take you as far as you think!
Fight, or flight?
I think a section of the Geneva Convention covers this.
Rex, we're playing-don't go rogue on me.
You were rather foolish to let me decide the rules of engagement.
Good thing my lawyers found the fair play clause.
You do realize this is a designated non smoking area
Maybe a nicotine patch would help you stop smoking.
Maybe a little spark will relight your fire.
No fair using fire, or I'm telling mom!
Listen Dragon, I don't wanna fight, I just want my Vape Pen back.
If I win, you entertain at my son's birthday party.
Show some imagination!
If you really want to win on Dancing With The Stars, you have to quit smoking and practice, practice, practice!
Your 'fire-in-the-belly' aggressiveness could be toned down with Tums.
I'm glad we leveled the playing field
God, I wish I had Snapchat right now
If you want to maintain greater anatomical symmetry, you need to switch sword fighting arms from time to time.
Twelve feet tall, yet look at the size of those hands.
St.George! Believe me, I knew St.George and you're no St. Geoge
Don't You Dare Cross Me
Let's say we call it quits and just go have beer.
Well...At least it's a fair fight.
It's a good thing that I don't believe in myths!
'Or the other way we settle this is I get you to offset your emissions in a carbon trading scheme'
St. George, by George
Moments later, Trogdor tired of swordplay and simply ate Steve.
You've got all hot under your choler again, Puff
You're frustrated. Let's try mumblety-peg.
We could go back to air guitar.
Don't forget; you agreed to Marquess of Queensberry Rules.
Wait till I beat you in chess
I won the toss. Did you think I would choose the pen?
Actually, I prefer the online game.
This is a lot more interesting than tilting at windmills!
How the shish kebab was invented.
Too bad. It's not my fault that you forgot your shield.
We're getting too old for this.
After years of therapy, Puff the Magic Dragon finally gets in touch with his anger at Little Jacky Paper, and takes him on.
It’s good to see more people are fighting secondhand smoke!
George, you really expect to slay me with these?
Remember, we agreed that who wins the coin toss gets to choose choice of weapon. I won, so stop sulking.
Yeah, yeah -- you lost your fire and your shield. So what! I have to live with Hilary orTrump for four years.
You're a dinosaur if you don't get the new high-tech!
"ok, ok, but you KNOW I got to go pick up my kid at 2 ..."!
Damn these Marquis of Queensberry rules!
Beautiful coulé! Admit it. You’ve had lessons.
You’ll never be any good at this, Roscoe, until you quit smoking.
He thinks he's winning now. But just wait til he discovers that I'm not actually left-handed!
Hey, no complaining about the swords! You agreed to the rules, and rock beat scissors!
This isn't as fun since you went solar!
You look farmiliar. Didn't we use to frolic together in a land called Honnah Lee?
After the sword fight, can we have a fire-breathing contest?
These sword lessons will serve you until your sore throat heals.
Small hands?
Different breath of fire than my yoga class.
Only after seeing the dragon's smoke did Sir Lance realize he left the porridge on the stove.
Expelliarmus!
Nice try Puff, don't hold your breath; a dragon can't win a sword fight!
All right then - two out of three.
We'll have to finish tomorrow- Game of Thrones is on in five minutes.
I take it you are not one who enjoys frolicking in the autumn mist.
Finally have a job with great health care. En garde!
I wish the screenwriter would just let me smoke you.
You have very small hands.
Feel free to fly away any time.
I didn't say do you want a match, I said do you have a match?
Some of my best friends are Targaryen.
Wait, can we take a selfie first?
We had a deal - no fire and I fight left-handed!
I fight for your right to live Dragon. The sign means what it says- No Smoking.
It's parry and thrust, not parry, thrust and singe. There is NO singe. Now, once again....
Never bring a knife to a gun fight; especially when you're the only one with the gun.
No you can not have one last smoke!
I'm going to kick your tail.
Don't look at me...it was your turn to pay the gas bill....
Tiny hands and a belly full of hot air? You don't stand a chance!
Sorry, but it just slipped out in the heat of battle. I actually think you have a lot of important things to say.
But this is fair from my point of view.
Get angry! Get that fire in the belly!
Look...I understand that you're frustrated. Next time don't pick a fight after you eat ice cream.
No, it is definitely not true what they say about soldiers with small shields.
It ain't gonna work, kid. St, George wasn't a southpaw.
You know what they say about dragons with small arms??...
You should have gone with pistols at twenty paces.
Eyes on my feet, Pterry--it's all in the footwork.
I have to admit, I'm a little disappointed: I thought your sword would have been HUGE.
Fine, Mom! I'll log out and do my homework.
You should have a shield to make this a fair fight.
Well, maybe she wouldn't be in distress if you'd use a little toothpaste.
I'm just asking. Do you play chess?
Come on dragon, fight me mine you mean it!
Let's take a fire breather.
Enough with the temper tantrum. I specifically told you last week fire breathing was not in the rules.
Trust me; this is how David got started.
Spare my life and I'll pay for your braces.
OK, give me your best, Puff!
Sorry! Rock-Scissors-Paper-Match wasn't an option.
Afraid to use your stubby little left arm?
You don't like the new Edict of Emissions? Try riding a hybrid horse.
My agent promised me John Snow.
I thought you had stopped smoking.
This is your last chance for mediation before I get angry!
By George, let's do it.
Not so magic today.
If you think you're on fire now, just wait.
This is anything but over, Hillary!
Thy mother is of such small stature, the townspeople of Groo mistaketh her for an aardvark and raid thy family hoard as if 'twere Black-Friday clearance sundries at the marketplace bazaar.
The next round will be Words with Friends.
You challenged. The choice of weapon is mine.
Didn't you read the sign? This is a no-smoking zone!
Making kabobs is more fun when the meat fights back
You never reach for the check.
Guess what? I'm not Puff the magic dragon.
Remember, parry and then thrust.
"A sword, really? You're a blow torch just waiting to happen".
I can see you've been working out.
I don't care, practice harder. We are not showing up at Mideival expo unprepared again!
Dragon slaying is just a job. But designing fashionable dragon-slaying under armor is my passion.

We can call it a day if you need to catch your breath.

You know, smoking will kill you.
I will not take back that tweet.
See? THIS is how good it feels to fight fairly!

And who knows, they might write a song about you, 'Puff the Sword Fighting Dragon'!
"I can't figure out why you're still here and I'm extinct".
I really like your rock-hard abs...
Need a mint?
You really ought to have a breastplate.
Did I mention I'm a close personal friend of Puff?
Your tiny arms slay me.
It's always just pistols or sabers. Fire's never an option.
Why do you always get to make the rules?
I'm a super delegate, I have an advantage at determining the outcome.
Make this good and they will turn us into a video game.
what the hell do mean by "repent ye sinner"?
You realize you're the last of your breed ?
Now, can we call time out?
Civilized warfare is the only way to go, don't you agree?
No fair! Fire extinguishers haven't been invented yet!
You're Saint Who?
If I win, you get a tattoo of me.
I admire you for trying to kick that fire breathing habit.
I don't see how I can lose this fight.
That's Mr. Jackie Paper to you!
Relax George, if we weren't playing Renaissance faires, we'd be ubering!
Remember your oath: you shalt not use fire!
I thought we were going to do this with switchblades!
Are you sure you don't want a shield? You could get hurt.
Your challenge, my choice of weapons, T-Rex arms.
I hate these Dungeons and Dragons gigs.
You're not so tough with a sinus infection, are you?

Small hands? Harrumph.

It's not fair when you wear a flame retardant suit.

You're no fun anymore since you switched to vaping.
Tough without a thumb, eh big guy?
This princess better be worth it.
Your next lesson will be on controlling your anger.
You're steamed because you're on a raw food diet.
Never leave your wing-man!
You have really small hands!
I'd feel a lot better not half armed
Puff is miscast yet again.
God bless the queen's ban on firearms.
I told you we should have used the flame throwers to even it up!
Next you'll want armor.
I don't know which one of us looks sillier.
I was scheduled for a tempering.
You heard Khaleesi, only swords.
So this is the thanks i get for introducing you to your opposable thumb?!
Let me guess, you're his right arm.
Lighten up -- once the drought ends I'm sure they'll lift the fire-breathing ban.
You do realize this is a no smoking arena?
Thanks for not smoking.
How about it, best 2 out of 3?
Wait, you're a righty?
You've lost that fire in the belly, Puff!
Okay, now we're fighting fair.
Your rules! Why do we always duel using your rules. I was here first you know.
You're the one they call Lefty?
But you'll support me in the general, right?
Just breathe through your nose.
I'm sure it's 'Fight sword with sword.'
Ready...on three, switch arms.
If you want to be on TV, you'll have to learn to sing too.
It's probably acid reflux.
"Well, Fafner, you wouldn't let me choose a flame thrower as my weapon of choice

What do you mean you're taking it easy on me?
We're in a flame free zone.
En garde! For I, too, am magic and live by the sea!
Now it's your turn to "Feel the Bern"!
Animal rights, my foot!
That all you've got? Okay, now smell my onions!
In the end it was the smoking that finally slayed the dragon.
Whaddya mean I’m toast.
There's so little smoke that I'm not afraid of your fire!
Never should have had that last drink
Quit blowing smoke, Dragon, and fight me with everything you've got.
Warrior pose, seriously?
Marcia...eat a snickers bar already...
Did you have to take it literally?
I can see you were lying about being left handed
Medieval Times better give me a raise.
Thank you for agreeing to only use swords in our encounter.
I hear ya, but even here at Game Of Thrones Fantasy Camp, there are just a limited number of roles you can play.
If you don't let me beat you, you're SO fired.
Tired of being called small-hands loud-mouth.
Give up and I'll let you go.
Hey, it's not my fault that you don't have a shield.
I'm only doing this for a book deal.
Hey, Little Man, is your name George?
It's not the size of your sword, but how you use it!
At least you don't have to fight lefty.
Somehow, I still don't think this will be a fair fight.
Did I say fat? No, it makes you look full figured.
Really? A sword? You're a fire breathing dragon. The use of a sword is literally overkill.
I told you, if you want to breathe fire, I get to employ my drones.
You know you can breathe fire, right?
We should think about how society forced us into these roles.
Make it look good....my girlfriend is watching
No, insurgent phony, YOU’RE fired.
Stop, or I'll call Barney!
I think I'm done with CosPlay. I met a girl.
So where do you sheath that thing, anyway?
I deserve the shield because of your reach advantage.
Fortunately for me, I don't think you know where your advantage lies.

This is boring. Let's go back to painted wings and giant strings.
I'm way better at this than I thought Id' be.
The new rules have diminished the game.

This is all part of my plan: 'Let's make England great again!'
I still

Face it, my armor really is fireproof.
After this, do you want to go frolic in the Autumn mist?
Everything's a negotiation.
I don't see where this class will help me in the real world.
Just don't breathe on me.

Where's Goliath when you need him?
No, I will not give you $3.50.

You had me at hello
How long will this drag-on?
Do you feel lucky, punk?
Your french is abominable.
En charred
Puff, Diddy, whatever it is - - this East Coast/West Coast hip-hop war gets settled now!
Enjoy your last smoke; this will not drag-on.
You're not even her type.
Cowardly beast, where are your dragon balls?
Ha! Didn't see that baking soda coming, did you? Having an invisible right hand IS TOO a superpower!
I miss the old flame.

My quest, my weapons....pea brain.
No fuel...We duel...Its the rule
What...lost your helmut
Two out of three?
"Try putting your back into it".
Yeah, and your breath smells, too.
Thou still will be condemned by bards for use of disproportionate force!

Anything with a sword and a dragon is cool––when you're 14.
I never said you were a dinosaur.
Hi I’m Mike, Saint George couldn’t make it today.
Really, you need to work on your footwork.
Turns out that wings and flaming breath are no match for an opposable thumb.
You have my word. I'll return your eggs when we finish posing for my tapestry.
Geez, I'd rather be home watching Game of Thrones.
Guess I fell asleep playing video games again.
No, it's you who is under-compensating.
I think we need an eleventh duel commandment.
How dare you tell me "That this is a non-smoking zone."
