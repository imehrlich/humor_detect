Listen, I've got to run.
No wonder this gym was so cheap.
Honey, I've been put on the fast track.
It started with a stand-up desk.
It’s Karma !! But who’da thunk the hamsters would inherit the earth?
Can I call you back? I'm on a roll.
Everything's running smoothly up here. How are things in maze?
What goes around comes around, believe me.
pD piety, pD piety, pD piety, …
The pay is good but they treat us like animals.
I wish I could tell you when I'll finish here but there's no end in sight.
A few more minutes, Honey. The Tesla isn't charged yet.
…and cancel my three o’clock. I need to hit the maze.
It's not as glamorous as you think, Mom.
Honey, is the Tesla recharged yet?
If this trial succeeds we can start testing on mice.
Yes, sir, it's a little like groundhog day.
I'm working from home until my wife can get the kid another hamster.
I think I'm finally getting somewhere!
Ok. Try the Tesla now.
When Hamsters dream.
Circulation Department, how may I help you?
I thought '401K' meant something else.
I'm not trapped if it's what I choose. I'm not trapped if it's what I choose. I'm not trapped if it's what I choose.
Oh, I'm going great! I'm living the metaphor!
Sorry. Can't talk. Gotta run.
Is the wifi back up yet?
There's a BIG difference between a hamster and gerbil, Bob.
I'll talk to you later...I gotta run.
Let's just say this job lacks any opportunity for advancement.
I am still getting used to working at the White House.
Work for a startup, they said. It'll be fun, they said.
Is the psychological test just as demanding?
Take the corner office, they said. It has a great view, they said.
I think they've taken the employee wellness program a little too far.
Hello, this is Ferris.
You won't believe what I just re-invented.
Siri, where's my exit?
It's not the destination. It's not the journey. It's actually nothing.
Few more years till that corner wheel.
Hey, let me call you back. The cedar shavings guy is here.
I can't stop. It powers the Wi-Fi.
Can't talk now, I'm going for 'Exceeds Expectations'.
I'll circle back to you later. I'm running a bit late.
Feel the Hamster! BE the Hamster!
Oh, you know how it is. You can never catch up.
You're sure she said she likes hamsters?
When Hamsters dream.
It's not bad. There's cheese.
Note to self: Karma is a bitch.
I enjoy the wheel, but the litter box is hard to get used to.
Can I call you back? I'm in the middle of something.
Cancel my appointments! I'm stuck inside a metaphor.
No one tells you about this in law school.
No, I'm sorry, you have the wrong extension. This is "What Goes Around". You want "What Comes Around" at extension 2253.
No robot's gonna take MY job.
I'm great; they put more sugar in the water.
Good morning you've reached the White House fact check line!!
Janet, tell the valet to bring my ball out front.
Honey, I'm running late at the lab.
What goes around comes around. So what?
Honey, I'm practically running the business .
The guinea pig is on maternity leave. May I help you?
Ironically, they also took away my mouse
When it reaches fifty pellets, sell.
Turns out that being the bosses' pet has drawbacks.
It's all about the journey.
The new corporate ladder.
I just feel that my career isn't going anywhere.
I finally quit my desk job.
Ha! Ha! I'm not going to waste MY life sitting behind a desk!
I wish scientists would go back to using real hamsters.
I just can't believe they make us wear a tie.
United States Department of Energy. How may I direct your call?
If I close this deal, they'll give me a plastic ball so I can roam the halls.
I just hope I'm not in the control group.
Hipster! I told the recruiter I was a hipster!
The moment Jim realized that when he ran faster, the wheel went faster too.
The last corporation I worked for had a ladder.
Well, I did ask to be kept in the loop.
I know, I know but I was so sure the solar panels would be enough
Good, now we're getting somewhere
He has some different ideas, but he's the best cardiologist I've ever found!
Things that go around come around
Going green: 2 more hours and my Tesla will be charged
Call my wife and tell her I'm running late.
I'm just training for my 401k.
Mom! I got the job! And my own office!
I still prefer this to the old grindstone.
I'm calling from the Hamsterdam office.
Can't talk now - I've got to run.
I was just calling to see who "moved my cheese"?
This is a promotion. I used to clean the cage.
Hello? I'd like to report a squeaky wheel.
I thought it was just a metaphor.
Ok, if there is no God, who changes the water?
Standing desks are totally last year.
Why don't we meet for pellets and discuss this in person?
Not what I had in mind when I joined Habitat for Humanity.
It's a bit expensive for a studio, but the gym membership is included...
Sisyphus adapts to the modern work environment.
I dunno,' I'm feeling that our company's training program lacks something in vision.
It's just a pet project of mine.
Isn't that rat's coffee break over yet?
I miss climbing the corporate ladder.
This job is taking me nowhere fast.
I'll be late for the meeting. My Karma's a little backed up at the roundabout.
Not much... just a run of the mill day.
Yes you have reached the Spin Doctor.
This is the longest-running job I've ever had.
I'm beginning to miss the old corporate ladder
He thought "off the grid" meant solar panels.......
All my needs are met. All my needs are met. All my needs are met...
Okay, so I'm going nowhere in the company, but my heartrate has never been this good.
Next week I'm going to nail that maze.
I feel like I've been running in circles.
It's nice to see jobs coming back to America!
HAMSTERS Inc. May I help you ?
Do we have power in the building again?
I was just hired, but everything already revolves around me.
No, no! We don't test on animals.
I say we keep doin' what we're doin' and never look back.
This is not quite what I expected when I signed up for a spinning class.
I gotta run, call you later.
"Do you think we could put those solar panels back in the budget next year"?
I asked for a raise but they keep giving me the run-around.
Call maintenance—my sipper tube isn't working.
Five more deals and I'll get upgraded to the treadmill
We have been going round and round... There is no way out...
Frankly, sir, I'm not sure how much more we can spin this.
Can't talk now, I'm running late.
It was cheaper than solar.
It occurred to Bob that somewhere there is probably a rat trying to get out of the people race.
Yes, hello - I'm looking to switch to solar.
I'll never get anywhere in this job.
Sean Spicer, 2018.
He's training for his 401K.
Finally, I think I'm getting somewhere...
The wheel of the boss goes round and round; round and round; round and round. The wheel ...
Yes, I run the business myself.
This office doesn't run itself you know!
Just have the lab results on my desk by morning
Sheila cancel my four o'clock. I'm running behind schedule.
The wheels on the deal go 'round and 'round....
This new workout equipment seems a bit... ironic.
I knew that 'Wheel On The Bus' song would drive me crazy someday!
The things we do for our kids science fair projects!
Yes, I do think this revolves around me.
I need that report on my floor by noon.
Nonetheless, Proud Mary keeps on burning.
I don't give a rat's ass about this study.
'Finally, I got an office with a window.'
Nike Customer Service, can I help you?
The worst part? I haven't been able to check my phone.
It's a new era in American energy!
My career has come full circle.
The bathroom break is going to be ugly.
Memo to HR: The fitness center really stinks.
White House spin room. No, I don't know when it's all going to stop.
Honey, let's just go with the standard charger for our next Tesla.
If I don't wrap this up in ten minutes, I'll miss the bus and have to walk home.
I prefer the standing desk...
The kids promised to take care of it but of course I have to do everything.
Nancy, hold my 3 o'clock, I'm on a roll.
I get to test all the new things first.
I'm running late.
It's called "Yoga for Type-A's
If I hurry maybe I can make it!
Won't be long until I'm bumped upstairs to the maze.
Sure I feel better, but I also feel like eating the kids.
This is my 150th New Yorker Caption Contest submission, but I know I’m close to winning.
Annie, clear the rest of my afternoon. Jonathan is going to play with me when he comes home from school, and I'm going to escape and hide in the back of his closet until 5:00.
It does seem like that at times, but I've got great health insurance.
This is Ari Sisyphus--how may I help you?
U.S. Department of Energy, Research Division, Clean Coal Branch. How can I direct your call?
I'm running the numbers as we speak.
Tesla; The Early Years...
Oddly enough, it is billable.
yes i am working on my stand up Circular Elliptical Hamster Wheel desk
Hello. Trump Administration Department of Energy.
I'd love to do lunch, but my cheeks are already stuffed.
The new firm is great! They provide a gym, bottled water and bathroom all in one spot.
Mensa testing, may I help you?
Sorry Honey, I'm running a little late tonight.
The wheels on the job go 'round and 'round, 'round and 'round all through the town
I'll have mine with cheese.
When they told me I had all the power in the company, I didn't realize this is what they meant.
Life is about the journey not the finish line.
It's win-win. We save on healthcare and heating.
I'm still making the rounds.
The Facebook quiz said my 'spirit animal' is the hamster.
You'll have to speak up, I'm on my wheel phone.
The office gym's not much of a perk.
Honey, I'm going to be late again. I just can't seem to get out the door.
No, sir, I am not giving you the run-around.
We really should have gone with the solar panels.
Wish I'd gotten on facing the window.
The eliptical one was too hard!
I'm starting to miss the rat race.
I love the my Ultimate Fitness Document Shredder.
So we're on for the 3 o'clock meeting? Great, great. And just so you know you can shit all over the floor in here.
No, I am quite serious. This job IS a rat race.
It's not so bad. At 5:00 they switch the bottle to beer.
Somehow I thought a home office would be different
I wish I had said ok to the stand up desk.
It's preventive medicine under Trump's new healthcare plan.
W H E E L O F F O R T U N E
My pension kicks in when?
At least I know where I'm going.
I'm in my wheelhouse.
Hey boss, We got enough power yet?
I love my job I love my job I love my job I love...
It pays the bills.
Don't worry. I made sure there's no paper trail.
What does this company even make?
I'm getting nowhere fast in this job.
Let me circle back to you on that.
I'm going nowhere at this company.
My workplace health incentives are getting out of hand.
Rats, I'm stuck in a metaphor.
Good thing I packed lunch in my cheeks.
I, for one, am glad Trump is bringing back coal.
Run that by me again.
Keep me in the loop.
They're right; people become like their pets.
I think I'm going to go back to the standing desk.
Most existing shareholders would agree that there's value in our alternative energy sources.
How long is this stress test going to last?
Miss Jones, could you please ask Suri what Mankind's next evolutionary stage is predicted to be like?
I'd quit but it has health insurance and a pension.
Hold on, let me get the door.
I don't know who they are, Marie. They say they'll let me go as soon as we release Billy's gerbil.
I don't know. I just feel like I'm not getting anywhere.
Nah, nothing new - just the usual rat race."
And advise my next appointment I am running late.
Standing desks are so passé.
Pace yourself Greg, it's only Monday.
I'm telling you, having a treadmill at your desk is so last year
Sometimes I would just rather be caught in a glue trap.
I wish they had set my wheel up facing the window.
Staff meeting in the Habitrail at 1:00.
No, Sally, I am NOT the boss' pet!
On the upside the cardio is fantastic.
I thought H.R. was describing my new job metaphorically."
It looked a lot more fun on the infomercial.
Really, I can stop whenever I want to.
This Fitbit competition is now officially ridiculous.
Sir, if you are happy with this call, I'll get a sugar reward.
This job has great health benefits!
When I said I'd be the guinea pig for this study, I was speaking figuratively.
Ferret, Ferret and Hamster, How may I direct your call?
Hold on, I'm paying the electric bill.
"Sorry I didn't call you sooner. I've been doing a lot of running around".
I tell you, this hands-free headset is absolutely liberating.
I am not only a spinning wheel sales representative, I am also a client.
Can't talk now, I'm on a roll!
The standing desk wasn't doing it for me.
Don't worry. I'll get around to it.
Gotta run, Honey. A big wheel is in my office.
Wheel of mis-fortune.
I thought it was a metaphor
I'm almost out the door.
I think the hamsters may be on to something here.
It depends on what you mean by 'progress'.
Switching to pet health insurance plans is supposed to save the company millions.
Meeting at the maze in 5 minutes.
These health care plans are ludicrous.
Hate to let you go, but I have to run.
I think management is trying to tell me something.
Talk to you later, I gotta run.
This is not what I thought the President meant when he promised jobs generating energy.
In point of fact, the runaround is our speciality!
Speaker Ryan's room at Mar-a-Lago
I'll be over as soon as the Tesla is fully charged.
Yes, of course I'm hydrating, Honey.
I will make partner. I will make partner. I will make partner.
I will not text at meetings. I will not text at meetings. I will not text at meetings. I will not text at meetings. I will not text at meetings. I will not text at meetings.
White House press office. Can I help you?
I don't mind powering the building, but I'm gonna need the chips changed more often
I don't know how I feel about this new "let's move" campaign.
to find the hamster you must be the hamster.
Why would I stop now? I'm WINNING!!
When I offered to be a"guinea pig", I didn't know they would take it so literally.
Same old same old. You?
Yeah, my boss said the promotion is right around the corner.
Cancel my 3:30. I still haven't figured out how to stop this thing.
Yeah, I'm on my way out the door now.
That's OK. I can hold.
No matter how hard I work, I never can catch up.
I used to work for peanuts, now it's sunflower seeds.
My computer does everything now. I just make the electricity.
Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere.
The guinea pigs called in sick... I'm from the temp agency.
I'm beginning to doubt the "the door is open to new opportunities" speech the boss gave me.
Then she claimed I didn't understand metaphors.
I ran out of Xanax.
Our motto is: 'We run circles around the competition!'
Human Resources? I'd like to discuss the new fitness program.
You mean the door has always been open?
This deal is going nowhere fast.
Ok, I'm just a few steps from the door.
Bixby finally realized, the companies effort to cut energy costs had gone to far.
One...one...one...one...one
Are you sure this is the corporate ladder?
Cancel my two o'clock. I'm on a roll here.
...and a side of sunflower seeds.
Maybe my career really is going nowhere.
I complained about not having time to work out… my boss was very accommodating.
Everyone thinks I'm the biggest wheeler-dealer in the firm.
I'd love to keep chatting, but I've got to run.
They're always trying to get me to retire.
Because I'm one promotion away from a cat tree
Our solar power has its downside on cloudy days.
OK Bob. We all know what goes around comes around, but what are we gonna do, reinvent the wheel? Let's put a positive spin on this and roll with it.
Green Energy Department. How may I direct your call.
I see no opportunity for advancement.
We really should have read the fine print in that new health plan.
With this new desk, I've lost 15 pounds, 3 inches off my waist, and any desire to continue living.
I'll get there when I get there.
I hope this is the last stage of this interview.
They promised me a desk once I complete the internship.
No animals were harmed in the testing of this product.
Almost there.
No more hamster jokes, OK?
Love it. Let me run it by the big cheese.
I have an opportunity to cut your electric bill in half.
When Rat Race hired me, I literally thought they were speaking figuratively.
Wish I could be sure Corporate's not just giving me the run-around.
Boss, I'm ready for the maze.
This job isn't taking me anywhere.
Then I said, what makes you think you have any magical powers.
Madam, I'm offering you a lifetime of freedom.
I could reverse myself, but nothing would change.
I've been promoted to 'spin man', but it's not as glamorous as it sounds.
Yes, much better. I am going places here, not like my old job where I was just treading water.
Any day now, I'll get my own EXECUTIVE wheel.
Honey guess what? I got my own office!
Yeah, okay, call me back. I'm not going anywhere.
An MBA for this?
No I didn't see that, we shredded all the fake news for burrowing.
I just want to close this deal, Mike, but you keep giving me the run-around!
C'mon, Frank. We close this deal, they'll give me a company ball.
I'll get around to it in just a minute.
I'll try to pick up cheese on the way home, but for some reason they've made it impossible to find.
And at 5:00 pm, change that water drip to a single malt scotch.
White House pet, Sean Spicer.
I'll leave as soon as the Tessla's charged up.
I need those reports on my floor by noon.
No, really, I've gotta run.
Hey, my wife had 24 kids last night.
No, I mean literally.
Just 200 miles till retirement!
Honestly, Ma'am, nine pounds per day!
Yeah, Bill just got promoted. You should see the shavings in his office.
Let me circle back to you after I get something to eat
Hamster, Inc. -- may I help you?
Yes, I got out of that rat race.
If there's one thing I miss, it's the toilet.
I'll call you when I get there
Yes, I'd like an order of wood shavings, fresh kibble and today's want ads.
I probably should have stopped at the standing desk.
Is this PETA?
If I meet my sales quota, they'll change my shavings.
Why did I hire a hampster to be my therapist?
The game show of life. Round and round he goes... where he stops, nobody knows.
Well, it's not exactly going to be zero emissions.
And move up my one o'clock feeding.
"Yes, sir. I will be ready to scurry out of here in a few minutes".
No thanks. I still have yesterday’s lunch in my cheeks.
Well this isn't how I imagined retirement either.
Gotta run.
'The consultants reclassified the position down to its basic elements.'
I'd like to change my order from pick-up to delivery.
On the plus side, I am drinking more water.
I really feel like I'm getting somewhere now.
I just know I'll never get ahead in this job.
I'll be right there.
Only difference is, I don't EAT my off spring.
I can't believe hamsters actually do this.
I miss the old standing desks...
Yes. I'm running for office.
I miss fieldwork.
Solar power is overrated.
At least I left the rat race.
Really great great job. We offer Trumpcare, plus access to the best ever gym.
At least I'm on track.
You know...same old.
This is not what I meant when I asked for alternative energy.
We make our own hours as long as we can finish what we start
Sorry, I'm running late.
............ and I'm selling my standing desk on Craig's list.
Let me know when the lights come back on, boss.
Gotta go, I’ve got a maze at three.
That giant hamster will be coming to feed me any minute now.
Hamster Inc., how can I help you?
See if you can push the meeting, Susie. I'm running late.
I thought they said hipster office.
I'm so tired of all this busy-work.
Another day, another pellet.
Squeaking sound? Must be a bad connection.
After the NIH budget cuts, we had to let the rats go.
Never insult the big cheese.
My career is going nowhere fast.
My productivity is way up and it's great for my cardio, but the whole bathroom thing still freaks me out.
They've got me running in circles.
The back-up generator is up and running.
Announcement: team building begins in 10 minutes at the maze.
I need that report shredded and on my floor first thing in the morning.
What do you mean I'm like a broken record?
Yes, I’m running over your proposal, as we speak.
Hey, at least I am getting paid!
Gotta work those hamsterings!
And the winning number is...
You know, Tom, I'm thinking about trading this one in for a battery operated phone.
Maybe removing the water coolers wasn't my best idea.
65 more kilowatts and I'll make partner!
Sorry Honey - The boss has us all running overtime.
Ironically, I can leave anytime I want.
Same as every day--wheeling and dealing. What's up with you?
You'll love working here. Every office is furnished with the latest exercise equipment and free beverages.
It's called the "hamster's revenge."
Sure, I'll hold.
I just don't feel like I'm going anywhere in this position.
Time stops for no man.
Its essentially an office job, but now it comes with a handy sippy-cup.
Well, it's better than acting like a lemming!
I'm running to my 12 o'clock
"It'll be a great job," they said. "All you can drink," they said.
This call may be monitored for training purposes.
Let me know as soon as there's room in the maze.
I'm just spinning my wheel here.
I know what we agreed to, but for a little while, I thought you could try wheeling while I do the dealing.
I hate renewable energy.
At Google HQ, Dave's pet project was literally going round in circles
Hold on for a minute, they're about to come in with a treat-treat!
Working in the White House ain't what it used to be.
I miss the old rat race.
We might squeak by this quarter, Jim.
When can we get the electricity?
Catch up with you later, I’m running a bit behind.
When is that new intern starting?
Like most ambitious junior executives at Petco, Bob started in Product Testing.
Tell me again. Why won’t I need a rest room?
They gave you the wrong extension. The rat's been promoted to Maze.
I'm sick and tired of being called the boss' pet.
I’m living the dream; albeit a gerbil's dream.
You want Johnson down in the Ironies...I run Clichés.
Cancel my lunch appointment; I've just remembered I buried some food in the corner.
It's my pet's Bring Your Owner to Work Day.
Think outside the box, Clint!
Yes, you bet, just making things great again!
I keep having deja vu.
This is the last time I vote Republican.
Nobody said reducing carbon footprint would be easy!
Give me a brake.
They fired the rat.
Honey, I'm almost out of Red Bull
Safe to say, the current strategic plan is short a beginning, middle, and end.
...be there soon, I'm running a little late.
Let's catch up over a drink.
No, really. I've been on a treadmill all day.
Can I call you back? I have to visit the woodchips.
They told me standing desks are for closers.
Go back? It is not an option.
Deloris - the guy rolling around inside a ball. Send him in.
No, I've never heard of a book called The Metamorphosis, why do you ask?
Let me transfer you to my owner -- I mean -- supervisor.
Have I explained the Healthcare Bill sufficiently ?
No, no, work's good. I just wish they'd change the carpet more often.
When I was told I was going to be the boss's pet I had something else in mind.
"Just the usual rat race; You?'
Thank goodness they finally moved the water cooler!
Frankly, I feel we are going around in circles on this...
It's called the "Rat Race 500", professional edition.
Life's a Journey; don't stop believing.
No No Idiot, I said Ted Mills !!
It's nice to get a break from the rat race and work from home
This... is... better... than... the... ergonomic... desk.
Connie, I'm going to need more bedding in the bathroom.
These corporate Health exams are getting weirder every year.
Same-ol', same-ol'. How 'bout you?
Siri, remind me to rethink everything.
Trust me, the treadmill desk is a gateway drug.
I sometimes feel like I'm going nowhere fast.
I guarantee my hamster isn't doing nearly as well on the treadmill.
Sorry, I'm running late.
Just running over some paperwork. And you?
The incentives package have really changed around here.
Loafers were a poor choice today.
And the job ad said it was a fast track to promotion.
Talk to you later, I gotta run.
You'd think a rat would love to run the paper shredder around here.
For four hundred grand a year, you'd do it, too.
then my hamster ran off with my wife , but I'm ok
Metaphor? What's a metaphor?
I've chewed through the entire file and I'm still spinning my wheel.
Yeah, well, it beats temping.
I'll call you back. I've got to go roll around on the floor in my ball.
All praise our new hamster overlords!
10 more minutes and I get to read the N.Y. Times
I wouldn't exactly call it a 'rat race.'
Good news, honey. I'm out of the boss' doghouse.
Yes, this is the 'Make America Great Again' hotline. How may I help you?
You're talking to the guy who wrote "The Art of the Wheel."
Despite of my wage, I am still just a rat in a cage.
Remember when I insisted on having the inside track?
Could you bring in my catheter?
I am not sure I like this new health plan...
I asked HR for wellness, not wheel nest.
What have I been up to? I mashed-up exercise and work with some really cool sliding tunnels!
Gotta keep the lights on.
I preferred the standing desks.
It's become clear that I'm going no where in this company.
The Boss said I'm working on his pet project
If I'm here, does that mean mice are directing Lehman Brothers?
OK, but I have no idea why I am doing this.
If you give a modern man a cookie...
Tell my wife that I'm running late.
I'm not sure why nobody is taking advantage of my new 'open door' policy.
I need an order "to go."
10 more minutes and we'll have enough juice to turn on the lights.
Well, it sure beats the rat race.
Well the salary is ok but the health benefits are great!
I'm afraid my fitness tracker is getting the best of me.
Call you back, I have to run.
Yes, Mr. Ryan, it has been seven years. But I think we've nailed it this time.
Our card gives you more ways to earn bonus miles.
I hate hotel gyms.
I can't wait for this rotation to be over.
I've had an idea that might just be revolutionary!
Are the batteries charged yet?
What corporate ladder? They gave me a wheel.
Not sure when I'll get there. I'm running late.
You can't win the rat race until you run the rat race.
We thought we were on the forefront of renewable but now the boss wants to switch to coal.
Nah, after a while you can't even smell the cedar.
I'm sick of climbing the corporate ladder.
I've become the new pet project of our CEO.
I'm trying to climb the corporate ladder, but this sure feels like the runaround.
They're dangling an early retirement incentive in front of me.
This is getting me nowhere.
I'm going to be late; I'm stuck in a cliché.
I don't seem to be getting anywhere.
You won't believe it. For hours, I've been running around this room covered with banana peels and have not slipped once.
Sure, I respect the company's commitment to alternative energy. I just didn't realize what "Be Part of the Solution" meant.
Cancel lunch! Algernon's called in sick again, and I have to cover for him!
Doug was beginning to regret saying 'pets have it good.'
The challenge is to sell this image as a positive metaphor for corporate employees.
I feel like I'm going nowhere with this company!
Tell him I'm running late.
3 rules in life, run to win, drink to satisfaction and by all means keep your shavings clean
Yes Bob! I'm on it! I'm on it!
I think I'm making more progress today!
I'm running a little late.
I'm working hard but I don't seem to get anywhere.
And they said I'd never get anywhere in life!
I wouldn't call myself 'Boss's Pet.'
Yeah, and I got upgraded to cedar shavings...
Office gym my ass!
