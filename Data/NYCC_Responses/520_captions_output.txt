The narcissistic banana had a selfie addiction and no longer found himself apeeling.
Just because you made that guy slip doesn't make you any less appealing. They were laughing with you, not at you.
When exactly did you stop feeling like a banana?
No, I believe you. You don't need to show it to me.
Um, so I have "a friend" who's in love with his therapist, he just thinks she might be a little crazy...
you are not a shrinking violet are you?
Let's go back to the time you made that Freudian slip...
So tel me how you feel, Mr. Banana Peel... How did you feel about being thrown out?
We're making good progress peeling back the layers
Yes, to say I feel like garbage is probably an understatement.
I am sick of slapstick comedy I want to do something more dramatic!

So, you're making an appeal to lessen the number of New Yorker psychiatrist cartoons?
Can you tell me what's eating you up inside?
I wasn't ready.
I'm sure those feelings are temporary - in fact, I'm going to ask you to pay cash.
We call that a banana slip.
Honestly, I don't think I'd even recognize this Key person you keep talking about.
I think next week should begin peeling away the source of your transference.
We ARE making progress, but remember, sometimes a banana really is just a banana.

Actually, you ARE the butt of a lot of jokes.
OK..... I'd like to go back to that time in your life when you tried to form a republic
Despite my arrogance I still have appeal?
Was it wonderful for you?
How long have you felt like a fruit trapped in a berry's body?

Why do you feel empty inside?
I'm just a shell of the man I used to be, doctor..
So Mr. Peal, when did these feelings of 'Goin' Bananas' begin?
Tell me, why is your first instinct always to split?

How long have you had the feeling of being just an old joke?
I know this might seem unprofessional, but I just seem to find you more and more a-pealing...

No, Robert, I asked you to show me how you FEEL.
It depends on what your definition of "slip" is.

Women don't find me apeeling.
Let's peel back into your childhood.
Let's unpeel that.
No, it's perfectly natural for you to be aroused by a drawing of a member of the opposite sex. That's totally normal, not only for banana peels, but also for grown men who have steady jobs and even, perhaps, a popular Tumblr blog. Totally normal.

Let's see, at our last session we were discussing you're a peel to others. Shall we start there?
Thick skinned?

Why do you feel the need to compare yourself to apples and oranges?

How did it make you feel when Apple said that you had, 'gone bananas'?
You are afraid my of monkeys and have penis envy?

The correct expression is sex appeal. And no, I wouldn't care to.
Have you thought about getting some new material?
Stop calling me bananas, dammit!
Lets try focusing on the chimp.
You need to let go of Curious George and get on with your life.
None of my patients have peeled back the layers quite like you
everyone thinks it's so funny to walk all over me and they never question how it might make ME feel...

We all sometimes feel like our lives are a joke.

You have banana envy.
You say you feel stepped on and ridiculed?
Last week we talked about how self-actualization was driving you bananas...How's that going?

Don't go bananas on me! You've been through these split-ups before.
Your appeal is slipping? How does that make you feel?
So, it really was a banana in his pocket.
Clearly, you're suffering from a split personality.
So tell me...How long ago did he split?
So, you have this recurring dream.! You think people are avoiding you.
I won't be able to help you until we peel back some of that thick skin of yours.
How do you feel, now that you've opened up so much?
I always feel like I've got one foot in the grave.
Yes, I do understand that that slip wasn't consciously intended.
I'am tired of giving everyone the slip
It wasn't your fault somebody slipped on you.
After we peel back the layers, sometimes what we find is underwhelming.
I've lost my inner self!
When did you first feel this desire to take people down
That is not what is meant by the term Freudian slip.
Don't make me laugh!
Seriously, you can't let people step all over you and then tell you it's your fault.
Doctor, I love your legs, but your body language isn't helping me overcome the feelings of prejudice and discrimination we feel ever since those damned cartoonists began using us as an artistic device to represent slippery dog droppings.
It's no longer called a split personality.
I was just used and dumped. And it hurts.
A split personality doesn’t mean you're nuts.
So you tripped him. Then what?
No slips and falls this week - is that your problem?
For a banana peel, you're actually doing really well.
I just feel so hollow inside.
Give up puns? I appeal to you.
So what makes you think every cute guy is going to just fall over you?
it's not your fault people keep slipping
It's not unusual for a banana peel to want to be an octopus.
You've opened up, but I'm concerned you're starting to push people away.
What do you mean when you say you feel "empty inside"?
...again with the Freudian slips.
And now you feel used?
So what makes you think your life is just a joke?
My initial diagnosis is separation anxiety.
...and you feel responsible for your parents split?
Tell me why you think you lost your appeal.
No, you can't call me 'Jane!
Feeling empty is only natural, but do try to stay off of sidewalks.
I never realized how much it took out of me to get that monkey off my back.
My advice is you can't let the world eat your insides out.
Right, so the banana peel identity is the comedian and the banana is the sex object?
Feeling empty? Something missing? I wish we talked before the surgery.
You say you want me to walk on you?

You say you feel you're an accident waiting to happen?
So how do you peel?

So you feel people are laughing at you, not with you.

Nonsense. You are a peeling.
I don't feel complete, as if something's missing.
I understand your concern, but not every slip is necessarily Freudian.
Have you ever lost anything that meant a lot to you?
Really, size doesn't matter

I feel like the whole world is falling down around me.
You may want to check your potassium. I think you are over medicated.

You don't need a therapist; you need a good attorney.

So when did you first have the idea that you 'd like buildings and casinos named after you?
Why do you think you feel so empty?
I hear you saying you feel like an accident waiting to happen.
Sorry Mr. Cavendish, I don't usually eat my clients, but I skipped lunch.
I feel like I get blamed for every fall, Doc.
Just relax, Mr. Peel, and tell me what’s eating you.
Please stay on the couch so you don't make a Freudian slip.
I mean, I just feel like the fall guy all the time.
I sense you feel fruitless and unappealing.

You seem consumed by your emptiness.
I no longer find you attractive. You are just skin to me now.
So your banana split to be with a bad banana with a...greasy black peel?
So instead of being squashed you want to be the one who falls? You realize that poses another set of problems?

I think you need some time to peel.
I've tried Viagra and Cialis, nothing works. She slipped out of our apartment.
So, since the split you've felt empty?
Take me back to your parents' split.
I ask you, am I wrong to be angry that Freud stole my punchline?
I hear you and I understand. Simple fruits can be complex under the skin--you peeling back will make this a productive session.
Why do you say you´ve lost your inner self?
So then he just split?
This is how you feel once we have peeled back all of the layers.

So you think that you're responsible for the Freudian slip?
So. Tell me more about this "sexual slippage," as you call it, between media representation of fantasy and your perceived objective reality.
Believe me when I tell you, you're just plain nuts.
Perhaps it was just a Freudian slip?
You can't peel away your problems.

For how long have you felt that you are really a vegetable?
I watched my parents brown right in front of me
Explain to me again why you feel your life is so fruitless.
I feel like there's something missing.
Evasive, misleading, deceptive ... it doesn't matter how you describe it, the fact is you've been acting slippery lately
Tell me, when did you first feel this emptiness.
My life's a total joke!
I'm looking for a therapist with real appeal.
I feel like my life is just some big joke.
When did you first realize she was running around on you?
Please don't take this personally but I'm not sure if I'm qualified to help you!
why do you feel you are not appealing
How do you think I peel?
We could plead life?
You're telling me it was a Freudian slip?
You're depressed because no one finds you appealing?

Why do you think people step all over you?
You are, most certainly, an early bloomer.
How did it make you feel when he left you for the Genetically Modified Organism?

Sorry, I didn't hear that, I have a banana in my ear.
I know it's wrong, but I think I'm falling for you.
So, why don't you think it was an accident?
It's time for a change. You're empty inside. Your words are slippery; your behavior's rotten.
I'm going to slip on something more comfortable.
So what's been eating you lately?
And have you thought about reaching out to that snooty waiter with the full tray?
Did I just see a gorilla got off that lounger and left a banana peel on it?

No. I was about to suggest "schadenfreude" not "schizoid".
Sometimes a banana is just a banana. Sometimes a banana is just a banana. Sometimes a banana is just a banana.
I suspect you are going bananas.
The same nightmare again, being eaten alive?
But our attempts to probe your innermost self have been fruitless.
Doc, I have nothing left inside.
I'm sorry, but could you please explain what a "hollaback girl" is again?
I see you're learning to pull back your skin and show your true self.
This is clear evidence of a split personality.
Life's impact
How many times do I have to get stepped on before it's not funny anymore?
You blame yourself for everyone else's slip ups.
I don't think they're laughing *at* you.
So you feel like you're always being stepped on...
Tell me again what's keeping you from taking the next step and sliding?
Maybe you should see someone more Freudian.
I think you're slipping.
Your guilt about all the harm that you've caused in the past is preventing you from moving forward.
That sounds like a classic case of transference.
So, you say you feel used and discarded?

Textbook garden variety slip, not a Freudian one.

Don't worry - we all feel like we're going bananas some days.
So, why do you think that you don't have appeal?
Or...could the reason you feel empty inside stem back to your childhood?
Well on the plus side, you got a peel!
What did you expect? You fell in love with a monkey!
Was there one sibling that you felt closest to?
Okay, under hypnosis, you've peeled away all my layers; now show me where you hid the banana.
Do you know when you started feeling empty?
Let's not let our time slip away again.
How was life after the split?
I have always been mistakenly associated with a great number of slip accidents
Calm down, sometimes a banana is just a banana.
I've been robbed of my sex appeal.
Well most of my patients ARE fruits!

You look ... ! Tell me about it... Where did that came from?
I hear you saying you feel empty and wonder if you still have appeal?
I've been feeling kinda empty.
So you identify as a plantain in a banana peel…
So you broke away from the bunch you grew up with, and since then...you just haven't been peeling yourself?
Oh, I misunderstood. My receptionist said you were a *fried* plaintain.
Doc, I'm worried I'm bipolar; sometimes I feel like a banana and other times a plantain
So you feel you have a split personality?
Over and over I hear 'slip and fall' in my head.
So, when did you first notice you felt so empty inside?
My killer instinct just keeps growing.
And how did the split make you feel?
You said before you were going to stop letting things slip.
Let's call it "a banana slip"
I know, the composting craze has been trying for all of us.
Identity problem again?
Yes, I told the orange I was glad he was not a banana, but I was just going along with the joke.
So you don't think you have appeal?
I am getting the impression that we should look at why the monkey runs away every time you spank it.
The monkeys are just tearing my family apart.
And who do you feel second to?
I peeled first, now you.
Sometimes I feel it's all just slipping away.
So, you say people are always slipping up around you?
You are gonna be paying for this couch too, you know.
I have a great feeling of emptiness inside.
I think it's time to stop blaming your mother.
So you've been slipping back into the same old habits?

If the clown has forgiven you, don't you think it's time to let it go?
Yes now that you have opened up I understand the appeal that separates you from the bunch, but I can't slip from my professional oath.
i understand your empty feeling, going from top banana one day only to be tossed aside by a monkey the next.
you procrastinated and did not pay your slip & fall premium ?
The bigger picture is the laughter and joy for the children, not the physical discomfort to the individual.
Forgive and accept. People slip.
It's extremely common to develop feelings for your therapist. I'm going to recommend another doctor for you to visit." "I was literally inside you five minutes ago, Jill.
I can't help but feel I'm going to be the cause of someone's downfall.
Why do You think you always hurt the ones around you?
I'm sorry but as a professional I see my patients only in metaphor.
You feel like you are just one of the bunch?
I'm just tired of being stepped on, Doc.
At times I feel you don't tell me what I need to know
Why do you think I find you appalling? You are actually appealing.
Lets peel back some of your layers and discuss your parents. Did their split cause you a bunch of pain?
so...what did YOU slip on?
I'm sorry, 'it's what's inside that counts' is just a saying
Hmm, I doubt whipped cream and a cherry would fill that empty feeling for long.

It's not you fault. They should look where they're stepping.
So tell me, Mr. Cavendish, what's eating you today?
I just can't shake the feeling that my life has been nothing but a slippery slope.
It's not your fault he had one foot in the grave.
So you have feelings of emptiness, like something is eating at you from the inside...
No, you can't peel me!
So, you think your skin is unappealing?
This is carrying a Freudian slip too far.
So your dream was about a band of hungry monkeys.
And how are things going with your friends? Are you still hanging with the same bunch?
When do YOU think everyone laughs at you?
You're not the best banana in the world today. And that's okay.
It's NOT your fault, it was a Freudian slip.
Nobody anywhere, ever, takes you seriously?
Clearly that ice cream parlor incident led to your split personality
Do you think it's in your nature to bring people down?
You think I'm crazy, don't you?
I think we're getting into slippery territory here...

I'd like to suggest our Fruit Salad group therapy for you.

I just don't feel like I'm funny anymore.
It may sound bananas, but we need to make a fruitful appeal to your split personalities.
Go on, Mr. Bobbitt.
Have you tried a potassium supplement?
I think I could use a glass of water.
I can't. I see your appeal, but you're a patient....
I'm aware that the word 'slip' discomfits you, but I am talking here of the Freudian variety.
You need to stop blaming yourself for everyone else's slip-ups.
Psycho analyst, not bananalyst.
You don't like people falling all over you?
I thought it was a minor slip-up.
so why do you think the others in the bunch don't appreciate your sense of humor?
He just uses me for potassium.
So you and your wife are headed to Splitsville?
Why has no one ever fallen for me?
Mr. Burger, don't be so literal about losing your case on appeal.
I can see by your colouring that our time is up.
Your parents may not be human, but you’re still entitled to blame them for your problems
Would you say you feel emtpy since we peeled away the surface?
So, your mother was your first victim?
Wait, do you think you're not "a peeling" or not "appealing"?
I know you have a peel, but it is not good for your mental health to think that everyone falls for you.
Your suggestive remarks are not appealing to me!
You say you feel empty inside. Why do you think that is?
So the split was really hard on you.
Actually, I often wear a stalk of limp asparagus in my hair. Think of at as a conversation starter or even an homage to your Kingdom.
I see you're still grappling with the recent split.
I can help you out . Which way did you come in?
No, Mr. Peel, I do not want to slip on something more comfortable.
Depression, heart palpitations, fatigue. You could be low in potassium.
Yes, you're involved. But guilty for those blunders? Let's talk!
Indeed a slippery slope to be top banana again.
It must have been a terrible blow to your self-image as "the yellow stalker" when friends called it corny.

And how does that make you peel... I mean, feel?
"Now that you've taken responsibility, you have to learn to forgive yourself".
And in the dream, I'm strangling the gorilla.
Forgive yourself. You didn't intend for anyone to slip.
I always feel like an accident just waiting to happen.
How old were you when your father split?
This must've been a devastating split-up.
I always thought you looked like a slippery character
Now how do these dreams of clowns stepping on you make you feel?
I just can't shake this feeling that I already have one foot in the grave.
Sit back. Relax. You're getting very slippery.
tell me...were you rejected when you were a seed
It’s not your fault you were the only survivor of the bunch.
Why do they call me a slippery character?
So your're angry about slipping on an Orange peel and can't let it go.

And how did you feel when Donald Trump started to call you 'Slippery Pete'?
Yes, the outside is viewable but you're here for the hidden core
Of course you feel abandoned...
I was nuts. Now I seem to be full-on bananas.
This guy you've been dating sounds like a real MONKEY!
Now that my appearance has changed...I don't know which bathroom to use ?
Do you have insurance?
It sounds like we're dealing with a classic Edible complex.
So, you feel guilty about causing people to slip.Pee
When your mom split, how did that make you peel?
Being second is also valuable.
I can't believe I fell for you.
And did you feel this way before you were peeled?

So your dad split when you pretty young, huh?
So she slipped. Get over it!
Please stay off my floor--no need to make a Freudian slip.

It's perfectly normal to be upset. No one in your condition would want to be called a plantain.
I just feel like I've lost myself.
Do you want to talk about your feeling of being so stepped upon?
It feels like he's just slipping away
Seriously, they don't see you're a peel?
But what's really missing on the inside?
How are you peeling? I mean...feeling?
You need to forgive yourself. If somebody slipped on you and got hurt, that's not your fault!
'I'd say your peelings of emptiness are very organic'
But what if you saw yourself as 'appealing' ?

You've peeled back the layers but you continue to slip.
Yes, most peels go through separation anxiety.
Maybe they're not laughing at you but with you.
I had been doing very well, but lately I seem to be slipping up.
Again, I apologize... But surely can understand why someone might titter when you say you have a 'bunch' of problems.
You're low sense of self-esteem stems from the fact that you really are garbage.

I don't do "Freudian."
... and in what way did you used to be funny?
Do you blame yourself for keeping the doctor away?
Wow, that must have been traumatic for you. But how did that make you Peel?
That's a pretty slippery slope you're on, Mister!
Maybe you need to establish other goals rather than trying to make people slip and fall.
You're not an enabler, everyone has a slip now and then
So, how did you feel when someone stepped on you, slipped and fell?
Well, my father was from a strict organic family, while my mother was a plantain. So I guess I'm a banana split.
So you feel you were labeled?
My life's been an accident waiting to happen.
Ok, go ahead and tell me about your latest slip-up.

One at a time. Please.
How long before you knew you were on a slippery slope?
Well doc, I just keep having these nightmares of people slipping one after another after another. You think it has something to do with me?
Nobody finds me appealing.

When did you realize you were not organic?
You say your Freudian slips suddenly multiplied just before you went totally bananas?
Will these bruises ever heal?
I wonder if you unconsciously want people to slip and fall.
And that's how it came to be called the 'Freudian slip.'
I'm a chili pepper and I'm hot for you.
I don't know whether to laugh or cry!
Why do you feel the work we're doing is fruitless?
So why do you feel so unappeeling?
Your transference, not mine.
When did you first feel like a plantain in a banana's body?
I'm putting you on 10mg of Producezac.
Yes, Mr. B., a Freudian slip.
It must have been hard to feel like you were destined to be compost.
You're not trash. You're compost!
A dream about being stepped on doesn’t mean you are having feelings of being inferior.
So after the baby, he split?
I'm sorry. It just came out that way.... that you really are just a cigar.
You gave Freud the slip, when exactly?
You fear being purposely thrown down so someone can slip on you?
Sometimes I feel like I'm slipping from reality.
Maybe try opening up from the other end.
I can't get past losing my appeal!
So, she stepped on you. How do you feel about that?
What makes you think you're no loner appealing?
When did you first realize that you were born to be a mango ?
Sounds like you're afraid of hurting people.
Obviously, your fruit was not comfortable in its own skin.
How can I help you stay on that divan?
What else do you feel besides emptiness?
No, I think you're appealing.
I suppose that was a breach of the physician-patient relationship.
...as if the joke's always on you.
So your banana split you for a sundae?
Your case has no appeal for me.
What would you say is missing?
...So you say you're always being stepped on?
What would you do if I wasn't here?
And when did you start feeling like an objective correlative?
How long have you felt that people were laughing at you?
Why do you think you caused the accident?
What can I say? I slipped up with a younger peel and the wife split. It's all so cliche.
This recent split really took a toll on me
As a peel, how does that make you feel?
Yes, I see many cases of banana split personality disorder.
I feel like I'm an accident waiting to happen.
Sorry, times up, I gotta split.
What happened to the balls you had when you began your analysis?
Tell me again why you find a peel appalling.
Some people say I have appeal, but I feel so empty.
And did you begin to experience these feelings of depression when you realized that you were never going to be top banana?
I prefer the term "erectile dysfunction".
I SEE YOU ARE SHORT SIGHTED AND SMALL MINDED
When did you first realize you were only skin deep?
"Tell me more about this 'slippery slope'".
Hmmn...........sounds like you're playing the fall guy again
I’m not falling for that one again.
So you say you've lost your appeal?
It seems like you feel empty inside.
I know, it's a slippery slope.
Why do you believe only clowns fall for you?
And you said the split left you feeling empty inside?
I've been doing it the wrong way my entire life.
Lately, I've been feeling empty inside
So, tell me about those peelings of inadequacy again...
Yeah, I got it. What's the punchline?
Can you get a grip?
I can tell by your filthy thoughts you've been hanging around with a rotten bunch.
I feel like I'm a harm to myself and others.
You need to find your inner self.
I mean, who's to say I'm not an apple?
As a clone, your sexual stages are limited.
You say you find me appealing...
Is this your 'ego' talking, or is it just your squid 'id'?
You weren't abandoned. You were picked.
Then she said dating me was a slippery slope.
I just don't understand your appeal.
Tell me more about feeling discarded Mr. Peel.
It seems you have peeled back your surface persona. Perhaps now we can get to the real issues.
I'm afraid my diagnosis peels back nothing slipperier than a split personality.
I think you might be taking 'Freudian Slip' too seriously.
You are a model character for separation anxiety.
Say more about this feeling of emptiness you have.
Now that I've eaten your inner self, I suppose there's not much left to discuss...
Green, yellow, brown-- now black—can’t seem to fit in.
It's not your fault - accidents happen.
Are you a banana, or are you happy to see me?
And, you know, it's a slippery slope from there.
You need to make amends with your bunch
We call that a "Freudian Slip."
When you are with your vegetable friends, do you frequently feel misunderstood?
So you tell me how you peel?
Can you tell me more about the man that ate you?
I know how you peel.
Yes, you do have a remarkable ability to become whatever you want to be. Nevertheless, until the Supreme Court reverses its decision, let's stick with what's on your birth certificate.
Would you feel better as a couch potatoes?
You have absolutely no sex appeal. And NO, I'm not falling for you. Top banana indeed.
It's no wonder your mind was in the gutter...
"Sorry" says the psychiatrist, "I can only help homo sapiens!
Banana Bread? It's a sexual thing.
Have you still been dreaming about the monkeys?
So what you are saying is, your parents are trippin'.
Tell me about your fear of monkeys.
You are not some placeholder for some inner banana’s feelings.
I feel so empty inside. This session has been fruitless.
Tell me, did you always find it amusing when you felt yourself starting to slip?
Yes, what's inside is what matters most. That's why I ate it.
I know it's a slippery slope but you must talk about it to get your footing.
How do you mean, you feel like an accident waiting to happen?
You seem split about your relationship.
I'm sorry Mr. Cavendish, but would you be more comfortable with a less a-peeling therapist?...
And instead of taking me to the compost, this putz had the nerve to dump me in the trash, like I'm garbage or something.
Your not a fruit! Explain?
Yes, you remain appealing.
When did you first feel you were a zucchini?
Comparing my childhood to my sister's is like apples and oranges, she said...
So you're why so many Freudians slip...
I'm loaded with potassium, high in fibre and very popular as an up and go snack, so why am I here...? Well the truth is, I've always wanted to be a couch potato...
You likely would've had a better result with group therapy.
Gotta be a split personality. I'd bet a month of sundaes on it.
I think the issues with your mother stem from an oedipotassium complex.
If you slip on me, would it be Freudian ?
This new paleo diet seems rather strict.
But when they say they slipped on you, maybe it's just a metaphor.
Mommy always told me I had great appeal, but I'm not so sure.
So you think your life is on the skids, do you?
In my case "going bananas" is not just an expression.
I feel like I've lost my sex appeal
MY GOD YOU ATE THE BANNANA AND NOW YOUR HIM !
I can give you the name of a good spa.
So you feel your life is just slipping away?
I have become a couch potato
We both know there's no such thing as an accident.
I slipped into a comma.
Gretta, life isn't always going to be vitamins C, B-6 and potassium.
Nothing really appeals to me anymore.
So, he used you, threw you away........o.k I get it ...then what happened?
What do YOU think it means?
Do you remember when you first experienced a feeling of emptiness?
Why do you feel you're just a shell of your former self
It's not your fault that everybody slips up when you are with them....you need to get over it ....and move on.
You must feel very empty inside.
So, how did it make you feel when she slipped?
Something's been eating you. Tell me about it.
I can see why you feel nothing inside.
So, why do you find it distasteful when she calls you her top banana?
Exactly when did you feel your relationship start to slip?
How long have you been experiencing these feelings of emptiness?
I still have a long way to goooooo...........
So how did that make you feel when "chiquited' on you?
You appear to be suffering from an Edible Complex.
Not even your mother found you appealing?
I was born a berry but transitioning as a fruit
Yes Edna I did say if you want to beat depression you must have 100 percent skin in the game but you take things so literally
I understand you're not peeling very well.
And then I realized, I AM the slippery slope.
I think it all started when my parents split
If you feel like a vegetable, it does not necessarily mean you're schizophrenic
What makes you think I find you a peeling?
It takes time to recover from any life-changing episode, and it must be so painful that your banana split.
It appears you have commitment issues.
I'm just the shell of what I used to be.
Why do you think people don't find you appealing ?
Now we can peel back and get to your core.
Okay, Mrs. Banane, I understand your concern about the slips, but worrying about "Yes, we have no bananas" is a bunch of catastrophizing.
Would you say you're feeling hollow on the inside?
Lying on a sidewalk may be your most rewarding career option!
Perhaps the term 'fruit' was descriptive, not derogatory.
When was the first time you felt yourself slipping?
I feel that your sanity is beginning to slip.
What makes you think that your life is merely a punchline to one big joke?
Really? You named your daughter Emma?
I think I'm responsible for the Freudian Slip
You were saying you feel all eaten up inside. . .
So, you're here because he said your entire family was bananas.
What makes you feel empty inside?
You've been hanging with the wrong bunch.
And when he said that, how did that make you peel?
Keep it in your peel! I'm not that kind of therapist.
How long ago did you notice that you went bananas?
I've been empty inside ever since the split.
I was kicked out of the Berries restroom and they demanded I show them my seeds.
So what do think’s causing all these slip-ups?
What makes you think you lost your soul?
It feels like I am the one who is always containing the relationship.
So you feel that the split was a result of your yellowing complexion...
So how does it make you feel to always be the butt of the joke...?
I hear you saying that you feel eaten up inside and just thrown aside to rot.
When did you first feel this emptiness?
Yes, Yes, I am sure you were once quite the specimen but lets explore those feelings of inadequacy.
I just feel like a mere peel of my former self.
You let people walk over you once and it's a slippery slope!
Do you sometimes peel all alone?
Why is orange the new black?
Sounds like a case of separation anxiety.
I just have this feeling of emptiness
Tell me more about this obsession with composting.
Just keep telling yourself "It's not my fault. It's not my fault".
So you told him to stop monkey-ing around, and then what happened?
Well, it all started when Carmen Miranda and I first met.
No, my name is not Miss Muffet.
So how did you feel after you split?
I really have fallen for you!
Sometimes I just feel so empty inside.
You have every right to feel "discarded"!
Well ... Yes, Freudians slip but they generally don't fall down.
Let's talk more about your peelings…
It's only natural that you'd have a persecution complex.
So you have a phobia about being stepped on for laughs?
I know the extra competition is stressful, but it's only once every four years.
And how many people have slipped on you?
Surely, it was a Freudian slip.
I seem to have lost my purpose in life.
I've noticed you often use the phrase, "I slipped up on that one." Why do you think you do that?
And how does it make YOU feel that he slipped and broke his neck?
You can choose to focus on what you've lost, or you can focus on the happiness you've brought to others.
When did these anxieties about vegans begin?
You're thinking only skin-deep--get to the substance!
My life has been all slip-ups.

More importantly, do YOU think you have appeal?
Interesting test case for Darwinian principles, one way or another.
You feel stepped on?
We got into a big argument, and than she split.
When did this feeling of abandonment start?
Like Jeb you have nothing left that appeals to anyone.
Stop treating yourself like outdated gag.
You were ripe for a loss.
Why do you think you lack appeal?
You're projecting again . . . you are not the butt of ALL jokes.
Success is not measured by the number of people you bring down.
So you split on a sundae, right?
So you're saying, he's back in rehab and you feel like you're the slippery friend

So, I hear your life has been pretty slippery these days.
Do you have ANY idea what it's like to be stepped on by everyone and then get blamed for their problems?!? No. I didn't think so. By the way...nice shoes.

What do you mean by, "profound emptiness"?
When did this fear of causing an accident start?
How long have you had this fear of composting?
So you're feeling stepped on?

You say you are unappealing. When do you first remember having these feelings?
so you think that you have lost your appeal..?
Isn't it time to let go of your guilt
After which you suffer from uncontrollable hysterics?
But not everyone can be top banana.

I see. So you decided it was finally time to come out of the pocket.
Let me get this straight, your boss told you that you were fired... and THAT'S when you went bananas??

You have to quit blaming yourself. The accident wasn't your fault.
It seems to me like you may be struggling with an eaten disorder
Can you elaborate on this empty feeling?
Yes, I understand your appeal.
At least you still have your peelings.
To be honest, a part of me wants them to slip...
I'd like to refer you to a Skinnerian.
Try to think of yourself as a peeling.
Don't worry, you're not the first to make a Freudian slip.

That reminds me- I also need to pick up nuts and maraschino cherries.
You think you are what made Fueud slip.
Of course you're polymorph perverse
Let's find a better way to say "crazy".

Oops! I just made a Freudian slip!
I'm afraid it may be too late for Viagra.

Maybe people are laughing "with" you.
Why do you think lack appeal?
Let's talk about the bruises.
So, what do you think your appeal is?
I find that patients who don't make a Freudian slip feel they're not getting their money's worth.
You,ve been outsourced. I can't make you great again.
You're a banana peel. Of course people hate you. I hate you.
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "I seem to have lost touch with my inner self".
Freudian slip? No way - peel off!
So, tell me exactly when your banana split.
This is not the slippery slope that you want to go down.
I've felt empty ever since the split.
I appreciate the offer, but it's a slippery slope.
I really don't think you need to doubt your appeal to anyone.
So he took the best part of you and threw the rest away. How does that make you feel?

So tell me how you think your mind is slipping.
you are! appealing and well adjusted; we'll have to deal with the fruit or vegetable thing next time.
Your case is appealing to me.
And how did you feel when the heel hit you?
You miss breeding fruit flies.
Now i'm thinking the split was a good thing...
So I'm hearing that you feel empty and think you may be headed for a slip.
Tell me more about how you and your bunch slid across the border.
Uhm....I think there is a misunderstanding here... I, I am a Jungian... not a Freudian...Definitely not a Freudian. But I will be happy to refer you... .

You keep looking at my feet.
Frankly, I don't find this session that appealing.
Often, the transition from fruit to lumpin peel generates feelings of great loss.

What makes you think a split _has_ a personality?
Actually, you're my first post-op banana.
It's what's inside that really counts.
Don't be discouraged – not all women care about that.
My life is a joke.
For the last time, that's not what "Freudian slip" means.
It's a classic case of a split personality.
But why do only think it's funny if someone gets hurt?
It's always what's on the outside that matters.
You use this word "split", can you expand on that?
He gave me the Freudian slip!
Say more about losing your sense of purpose.
I've lost touch with my inner banana.
Was it Freudian?

So explain to me again why it's NOT what's on the inside that matters...
My whole life has been a joke.....

No, I am not going to do that with my legs.

You do realize in a couple of days none of this will matter.
So when did you first become aware you had lost your appeal?
Freudian slip and falls are normal.
But how did it FEEL when she stepped on you?
Of course, we all ask ourselves at one time, if a fruitless life is worth living.
So you feel people are avoiding you?
You need to find your center.
Berry, I know you are misunderstood, but you have thick skin.
Don't blame the monkey.
Did your fear of being composted start before or after peeling?
This seems to be less psychiatry and more internal medicine.
I don't think you need a psychiatrist to find your inner self, you'll need a detective.
Before we start, I think you should know I'm more of a Jungian anal-ist...err!
How did you feel when she fell for you?
He slipped so I came instead.

I feel like everyone thinks I'm just a big joke.

When did you get dumped by Apple?
On a positive note, I can safely say you are not nuts.
Well, I can understand why your ego might be bruised when you let a bunch of clowns walk all over you.
Why, because I like to sit like this - but wait I'm the one who asks the questions. You won't slip this by me.

I dunno...I just feel empty all the time.
And just why do you think people tip-toe around you?

And when he slipped on you, Nan, how did it make you peel?
"How long have you felt like you were just 'one in a bunch'?

With a slip, one is too many and a thousand not enough.
Screw doctor-patient relations, you are appealing.
Again with the guilt? He slipped. He fell. Get over it!
I believe that you believe you're a banana peel.
No, I don't know how many Freudians it take to slip on a banana peel!

I'm glad that you finally opened up.
Your payments are on a sliding scale.

No, euphemistic banana split is not a Freudian slip.
No, I am not going to enable your penis envy any more. It's time to move on.

Transference is a slippery slope.
I've always thought of myself as pretty easy to get along with but lately it seems like everyone feels the need to be overly cautious when they see me.
You pay on a sliding scale.
Doctor- I feel so empty inside.
Orange you glad I didn't say apple?
Maybe a split is just what your relationship needs.
Perhaps they're laughing with you?
I'm afraid I'm not as appealing as I once was.
Do you feel like everyone is stepping on you often?
Yes, I understand you think those slipups were your doing, but there are wider forces in the universe you don't understand....
So... tell me again... you think the producer of "Marriage at first Sight" used you...... and you want to sue for "shallow jocularity?......"

What kind of appeal?
I keep having this dream where every guy I meet falls flat on his ass.
And you're depressed because no one slipped on you?
Oh now, everyone slips up from time to time.
Look at it this way. You're also a great source of humor.

So you had a slip up...
I've been slipping up at work a bunch lately. I'm worried I'm losing my appeal.

Something seems to be eating you up inside.
Have you considered that you really are all peel, no banana?

How did you feel when you finally separated yourself from the bunch?
Tell me about your last slip.
And that's when my life really hit the skids...
