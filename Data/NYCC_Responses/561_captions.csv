And lastly Father, I bit the mailman
Tell me about it. It's been a week since I licked mine.
Can you hear me now?
Just let go of the stick and this will all be over.
And you thought the cat couldn't open the superglue.
No offense, but I prefer your other end.
You're right! The acoustics are amazing!
Squirrel outside, freshly waxed floor, plate glass window. You?
No, YOU need a mint.
This is great. They'll never find us now.
It's been two dog years since my last confession.
They're called woofers...hear the bass?
I love the privacy. I miss the testicles.
What are you in for?
It's great that that this kennel allows conical visits!
They said cones. I was expecting Haagen Dazs.
Needless to say, this stays in the cones.
Okay, guess if my tail is up or down?
How do I know you're really wagging?
Sorry. Wrong end.
What happens in the cone stays in the cone.
Let me show you something I learned from a French poodle.
What happens inside the cone, stays inside the cone.
Higher! Left! Behind the ear! Oh my God! There. Right there.
I hate that fucking cat.
I'll let go of the stick when you let go of the stick.
Don't worry, they'll never find us in here.
Bless me Rover, for I have sinned.
I don't think "fixed" means what we think it means.
Wait. They told you you're a good boy too?
Hey, you really CAN hear the ocean!
Oh, THAT'S what they mean by "dog breath."
It seemed funny when he did it to the cats.
I bit the hand that feeds me. You?
Chewed up the furniture. You?
We're on a secure line
It's a deal, then: I'll lick yours and you lick mine.
Your right I can hear the ocean
Let's call a spayed a spayed.
I was grabbing too many pussies. What's your crime?
You sure the cat can't hear us?
Can't see the cartoon because of your obnoxious pop-up announcing "GOOD NEWS!" PLEASE GET RID OF POP UPS!!!
That stupid "GOOD NEWS! We've merged our Cartoon Caption Contest Registration with our overall ..." is STILL defacing the contest after all these months...
Yeah, I can't reach mine either. But maybe we can work something out.
Use your inside voice
We can't be seen like this.
NOW I know what they mean by "dog breath."
Ok, on the third grrr, we both let go of the bone.
Speak English. They can't hear us.
Are you sure they can't see us anymore?
I don't remember anything about last night, either.
Nobody knew health care could be so complicated.
Leggo, it's MY bone.
Just some advice, don't stick your head out of the car window.
Vasectomy. You?
I told you we could hear the ocean.
There. Now we're invisible.
You're right! They'll never find us in here!
No, much deeper, like this..."Luke, I am your father."
Agreed, we bite them as soon as the collars come off.
Got olives and Vermouth?
I'm still covered under the Adorable Care Act.
So much for man being our best friend.
I want to see other dogs.
Barking aversion therapy.
Bless me Rover, for I have sinned.
I'd like to see more of you.
Do you think they'll find us?
I think it's time we started seeing other dogs.
YOU'RE BLIND. HE WAS SAFE BY A MILE !!!
Trust me, Max, the cones are the least emasculating thing that's happened to us today.
How rude of me. I thought this was your butt.
''Would you mind taking a look and let me know if I'm missing anything?"
Use your inside voice, please.
It looks like we've both been thoroughly vetted.
I think we should see other dogs.
I think we should start seeing other dogs.
Are you sure no one can see us?
They did WHAT while I was sleeping?!
If you can't lick the one you love, love the one you lick.
Ever feel like you have an itch you just can't scratch?
Imagine if this is what they do to their "best friends?"
Can we talk, or do you think these cones are tapped?
Don't think about where his tongue has been....Don't think about where his tongue has been...
Silence of the labs
Seeing eye to eye dogs
Would you mind turning around so I can identify you?
Silence of the labs
OK, it's safe to use our human voices now.
Do you think they know we are in here?
Get the "good news" popup out of the way. Haven't been able to see the cartoon contest for two weeks.
If you lick mine, I'll lick yours
I still prefer smelling your butt.
Your right I can hear the ocean
Yeah, he's not my best friend any more, either.
We've trapped the cat. Now what?
Mine was elective.
Extreme vetting.
They cut what off?
I knew we'd eventually see eye to eye...
I have a message for the Russian Ambassador.
I hate blind dates.
No, you hang up!
It's OK for whispering but for long distance you need a string.
Trust me - they'll never find us in here.
They can take away our manhood, but they will never take away our dignity!
I like this Facetime
No, I swear I'm not seeing anyone else.
Hey, I can hear the ocean.
So it's really true. Our breath DOES stink.
I think we finally have a secure connection
When I'm with you it's like the rest of world ceases to exist
Woof! Surround Sound is awesome!
Back up. No, you back up......
Hey! You DO get NPR on yours.
The pill is hidden in your food
What is it we're not supposed to be licking again?
I see we both failed at the RCA audition...
I think it's time for us to see other dogs.
Ok, here's the deal. You lick mine and I'll lick yours.
Dog Whisperers.
I peed on the boss's shoe; what are you in for?
Schrodinger's canine experiments proved to be less profound.
Not so happy with the dish, definitely going back to cable.
Speak freely. I'm positive we aren't being wiretapped.
I think we should start seeing other dogs.
Now can you hear me?
Don't sneeze.
I think we've been vetted.
So that's what he meant by extreme vetting
He said we were 'going to the park'.
The mailman goes down at noon. Pass it on.
Don't you hate the new confidentiality rules?
Muzzle Tov
Chinese dog trap
These are great subwoofers.
In hindsight, things weren't so bad.
If we put our heads together, there's nothing we can't lick.
It was considered a pre-existing condition.
Do you think they know we are in here?
(This is funny by itself and doesn't need a caption.)
It's been a month since my last confession.
If only we'd met a week ago...
What happened to "if you like your balls, you can keep em"?
RCA Victor/RCA Victoria
You talkin' to me?!
I can't take my eyes off you.
Are you sure we're invisible now?
Welcome to the cone of silence.
It seemed more romantic when Lady and the Tramp did it.
I think they don't want us to see what they removed.
No! When I say forward you move BACK!!
No, you let go of the stick first.
No... you walk backwards.
The first RCA Victor records logo wasn't a total success.
Well for the moment my bark certainly is.
Ya, well, I thought they said I was going to be "tutored"
You know that, sooner or later, one of us is going to have to let go of this bone, right?
Let go of the stick. No you let go. No you let go.
Apparently these cones are temporarary but those "cajones" are NOT coming back!
Use your inside bark.
Can we agree not to bark?
Were you followed?
I hear ya.
So that's what my breath smells like?
It smells like Shih Tzu in here.
Sorry about that, but when you gotta sneeze you gotta sneeze.
Facebook for dogs
Roll left on three.
I don't see yours either.
Who ever said, two heads are better than one wasn't wearing a lamp shade.
Go ahead and bark. It sounds really cool.
Forgive me Father for I have sinned.
This is almost conical.
'Cone'ference call!
No, YOU back up ...!
See? It's just like putting your head in the toilet.
No, I did not know they made the Chinese finger trap in this size.
You're right, the acoustics are fantastic!
Don't worry, we're legal in North Carolina.
One of us has to let go of the shoe.
I gave up licking for Lent.
!BARKRAB!
I'm the RCA dog. No, I'm the RCA dog.
Not so loud.
I know, I cant reach my junk either.
Face Time
I think we need a little time apart.
I'm not really feeling "fixed". You?
Don't worry. This is the only form of planned parenthood still funded by Trump Care.
Muzzle-Tuff!
Remember, what happens in the cones stays in the cones.
Mine's actually a lampshade.
I hate these team building activities.
Nope, still itches.
Now I know why I sniff your butt
Enough about politics. Let's talk about cats.
Man's best friend my ass.
It has been seven dog years since my last confession.
Is this your first time in Rehab?
I'm not a good boy either.
Secret Agents Fido and Rex used the "Cone of Silence" for sensitive information.
Tell me the truth - does this cone make my ass look big?"
Sorry bro' but I have to bark
Forgive me father. It's been two weeks since my last confession
Labrador receivers
All I see is you.
psst...listen you lick mine and I'll lick yours
I don't recognize you. Could you please turn around?
One of us could use a Tic-Tac.
You don't look like your profile picture at all.
I can hear the ocean!
No, YOU let the stick go!
I don't know if I can do this for four more years.
How long are you in for?
Forgive me Father for I have sinned.
No, you let go.
No, I'm, like, 99% sure this isn't how FaceTime works.
Mental note: never give a squirrel a stapler.
I know it seems like torture but it's only extreme vetting.
The beagle flies at midnight.
Just between you and me, I hear the head is the hardest part of a dog to draw.
Now that we have some privacy, I can tell you: He's not really my best friend.
You know we once roamed the wild in packs, right?
There's no way they'll find us in here.
I prefer doggy style.
Just think; if we both hadn't gotten fleas, we never would have met.
Have we met? I'm sorry. I don't recognize you from this end.
well the privacy's nice but I miss the other end.
Ain't this a bitch.
Just until Jan. 20, 2021.
Somehow it seemed funnier last night.
It could be worse. Under Trumpcare we'd have to share the same cone.
Where is everybody?
You're probably wondering why I called this meeting.
Remember, when we separate stop speaking words and just bark again.
Go ‘Woof.’ The echo’s insane.
Some party last night.
Humans call it "FaceTime ".
I have a message from the Russian Wolfhound.
Well, this just adds insult to injury.
When I woke up, they were gone!
I have a huge favor to ask you.
Personally, I would support a headwear ban.
And they named you "Lucky"?
It's been two weeks since my last confession.
Now that we have a secure connection, let's talk strategy.
For this plan to work, I think one of us needs to turn around.
I'm not the only one who could use a mint.
Let's see Wikileaks hack us now.
Are you hearing what I'm hearing?
Looks like this might be the last reunion of the RCA Victor Club.
Hello, Darkness, my old friend.
My left or your left?
My left or your left?
Seriously? You know they need a FIDO warrant to listen in.
Let's go look for our balls.
Finally, a little privacy
No surgery...I'm just an introvert.
I still don't recognize you. Turn around.
It's annoying but I get great reception.
Trust me, they can't see us.
I swear you're the only dog I am seeing...
Believe me, no one can see us.
To tell the truth I miss sniffing your butt too.
No, you can't stay like this until 2020.
Collar blindness.
Chinese dog trap
These things really put a crimp in butt sniffing.
Of all the cones in all the towns in all the world, you walk into mine.
Mint?
Next time, I say we just close the blinds.
Well, at least we can have a private conversation now.
I see what they mean by 'dog breath'.
Wow! Stereo woofers!
We're wearing these because they did !!"WHAT"?!!
When I look at you, the whole world just disappears.
Two Woofers Ignoring a Tweeter.
The microwave can't see us in here.
It's called suction. On the count of three, exhale.
You tell me, are you male or female?
I see you lied about your profile picture, too
Now guess: Is my tail up or down?
Darned if I know what we did.
Our spaghetti dinners just aren't as romantic as they used to be.
Stay still. They'll never find us.
Now you sneeze and I'll fart!
It has been three weeks since my last cone-fessional.
I didn't know castration would enhance my hearing!
I can't lick mine either!
I'm glad we ran into each other.
Finally, someone who gets me.
' Snip, snip,' she said. 'It's just a litttle cosmetic tweak, ' she said.
You should have had a tail lift while you were under.
Please stop barking.
The cat said we could get these off if we put our heads together.
Wag if you thought you were going for a ride to the dog park.
They're calling us the Coen Brothers.
Oh, god yes! A little to the left!
No, I never heard a cat laugh before either.
'You lookin' at me? Are you lookin' at me?'
I'll scratch your back if you'll scratch mine.
I think we should start seeing other people.
Let's make America great again." "Yes. And send all those dachshunds back to Germany.
Hey, I can hear the ocean.
Whatever you do, please don't bark.
Where'd everybody go?
Are you sure no one can see us?
Turn around. I don't recognize this end.
I can hear the ocean, but I still can't smell your butt.
Really? He told me we were going to the park.
Okay. You lick mine and I'll lick yours.
The acoustics in here are awesome!
It smells like Steve Bannon in here.
Don't worry, if we can't see them, they can't see us.
You lick mine and I'll lick yours, OK?
I still can't hear the ocean.
That's the sound of the ocean.
The code word is "bacon." Pass it on.
No, your breath is fine. I'm wagging my tail.
Cone Brothers
How's my breath?
Is this Facebook?
I gotta say, not as romantic as our spaghetti moment.
We can figure out how to get out of here if we just put our heads together.
I can't reach mine either.
[This cartoon does not need a caption. The image is perfect as is.]
It smells like a dog in here.
I hate Trumpcare.
We can lick this.
OK, we finally have some privacy. Tell me where you buried the bones.
Ok, ok ... my turn. Now I'll blow really hard in your nose and see if I can make your tail stand up!
I hear the ocean. Can you hear the ocean?
O.K: on three you lick my incision and I lick yours
Misery, meet Company.
Okay, on the count of three, we both let go of the cat.
You have dog breath too.
I don't think it worked for Maxwell Smart, either.
How long you in for?
Well then, you scratch mine and I'll scratch yours.
We need to stop meeting like this.
I can't believe we wore the same hat.
I think the NSA can still hear us.
A mailman. You?
Does this make us invisible?
Now I can hear you.
One of us is backwards.
That's right, inhale and hold it. Now, pass me the joint.
This way we will not lose the ball.
You must go to the same doctor as I do.
So that's the plan: you lick my stitches and I'll lick yours.
Worst game of chicken ever.
I feel like we are finally seeing eye to eye.
How about you scratch mine and I'll scratch yours?
When we put our heads together, we can lick anything.
ARF!"/ "FRA!
We can't be seen together.
We revolt at dawn. Bring kibble.
Trust me, we're invisible
Now, twist slightly counterclockwise and pull.
Yeah, I can't lick there either
Looks like you have pet insurance too.
I don't think anyone can see us
If neither of us move for another four years it’ll be like it never happened.
I bit the hand that feeds me. What did you do?
Sneeze again and I won't be saying Bless You.
Nipped or tucked?
The only bugs in here are fleas
Yes, it is a bit awkward, but just try to describe the smell of your behind.
Okay, you turn around first.
Hold on. Do you hear the ocean?
If only we had met two days ago.
No, really, you should brush your teeth more.
Were you followed?
Go ahead and speak. We're in the cone of silence.
This way they can't read our lips.
This was more romantic in Lady and the Tramp.
Twitter is so yesterday
Have you found that the shame is the worst part?
Oh, 'Hi', I was looking for the other end!
No, YOU need a mint.
Mine is a pre-existing condition.
Relax! I'm pretty sure no one can see us!
Can we try my plan now?
You look ridiculous.
The acoustics in here are amazing.
I think I'm going to sneeze.
I'd rather we make ends meet.
You're right. A Trump Tweet can't get in here.
This stays between us.
No kidding?! I had the same cartoonist!
Hey...hey...check this out...out. Bark...ark...ark...ark...
This isn't at all like they described it in the Kama Sutra.
I'll chase your tail if you chase mine!
I hate couples counseling.
Now we just wait for the film to develop.
Are you sure this connection is secure?
They're right! It really does sound like the toilet!
Had my balls whacked. You?
I always enjoy our little tête-à-têtes.
Can you keep a secret? I used to drink from the toilet.
Pre-existing condition?
You blinked.
I can´t tell if you´re wagging.
Who does your cone?
I bit the mailman, what are you in for?
We'll always have Schneiderman's Veterinary Clinic!
No, you turn around. I turned around last time.
So, now that we're alone, are your balls gone too?
It's so good to see your face again.
See? Doesn't it sound like the ocean?
One of us is facing the wrong way.
It's so nice to finally meet someone with the same world view as me
Why are we whispering?
Now I know what they mean when they say dog breath.
I hear the ocean!
I think I prefer the other end . . .
I can lick any dog in the house...except myself.
The funnel of love (I sent prior entry 60 seconds ago with typo - please accept this one instead)
You let go first.
Yes, I'll tell you. But you've got to take a bow wow of silence.
Yeah, it's just not the same. Turn around.
The doghouse has been wiretapped.
Let's ask the cat what to do.
What happens inside the cone, stays inside the cone.
No, YOU back up ...!
Conical visit.
I'll never trust another peanut butter covered 'treat' again.
Don't worry. No one can see us in here.
I think we should see other people.
I can't reach mine either. Now we'll see who our true friends are . . .
Didn't you think he meant ice cream?
I'm not into butts, either,
On second thought, turn around.
Nice to meet someone who shares my narrow view of the world!
Sure, we can't lick ourselves, but I'm really digging these acoustics.
OK, next time you be the Lady, and I'll be the Tramp
How about you lick mine and I'll lick yours?
I can't lick mine either!
One of us REALLY needs a tic tac.
Marco....
Wow, there's an impressive amount of drool collected in here
Two want-to-be Victrola dogs go toe-to-toe
'Yeah, my bark seems louder too."
Remember when we used to pee on the ground to communicate?
I don't think this is going to work. Let's just go back to doggie style.
I'm a big fan of old Get Smart episodes too
I knew if we put our heads together we could lick this thing.
Are you sure this is hack-proof ?
Frankly, Max, I rather prefer the old Cone of Silence.
Extreme vetting.
I don't think they can see us this way.
I thought this would be more romantic.
I know we've just met, but I feel like we have a real connection here
I think the end of the tunnel is the other way.
you smell different from this side.
Wow! These virtual reality cones are great!
I'll scratch your back, you scratch mine.
It's not your butt, but this will do.
Shhh! I think Schrödinger's cat is out there.
Nose job. You?
Canine speed dating.
You look like hell.
You smell different.
Now I understand why people make a such a fuss about dog breath.
I lick yours; you lick mine.
Of course your husband can't see us! No one can see us!
No you let go of the ball
I'm gonna need you to do me a BIG favor.
Got a mint?
Shh - you can hear the ocean.
Be honest. Does my breath smell?
Your breath is worse than your bark!
"You don't know how embarrassed I was when I saw some one else wearing the same cone".
You scratch my head, I'll scratch yours.
I'll scratch your stitches if you scratch mine
So this is what a canine blind date looks like.
Someone's got dog breath.
Maybe if we both exhale at the same time.
Pet-a-Pet
So it's settled. You lick mine and I'll lick yours
. . . and all over a lousy pound of caviar!
Two AM. White House lawn. Pass it on.
I've been wearing mine ever since they got that new microwave.
I don't think I can last like this for the full four years.
"Elucidate Camus and Sartre's stances on Existentialism with the picture above." - Essay Exam for 4th Graders in Singapore
You've got dog breath.
Oops sorry...wrong end.
You could use a mint.
Love in the Time of Collar On
Hey, you really can hear the ocean in here!
You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.
You know, this is going to be on America's Funniest Home Videos.
So near but so far.
"Now that you mention it, your bark IS worse than your bite.
WOOF!!FOOW
I've just been itching to meet you!
I can't tell either, but I notice my bark sounds higher.
If you chew my tail, I'll chew yours.
Chief? Yes Max.
You were right honey, we can eat spaghetti in these things.
I hate this extreme vetting!
How about you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours.
Hello, is it me your looking for?
You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.
My owner calls it a blind date.
Yeah, I can't lick mine either.
I'll betcha we'll go viral on You Tube!
OK, we can talk now.
How much longer do you think this eclipse will last?
Are YOU wagging your tail ?
I'll lick yours if you lick mine.
Good, now we're completely invisible.
Listen Max, it's only awkward if you make it awkward
Waggileaks.
Don't bark this to anyone -- I love cats.
Remember the rule of the cone of silence: "anything said in the cone stays in the cone".
Hey! I do get better reception!
Okay. Can you hear me now?
Now that we're alone I have an enormous favor to ask.
Is it just me or does it smell amazing in here?
Are you sure they can't see us?
But how do you KNOW the Russians aren't listening?
You need to get out of my face, bitch.
Use your inside voice
No, YOU were going to turn around!
This is not how I envisioned the Cone of Silence.
I grew tired of the butt-sniffing scene, and decided to give blind dating a try.
Okay, but no tongue!
In here, no one knows that you are a dog.
What are you in for?
You mean yours AND mine are gone?
So, you're here for the new Victrola auditions?
Why couldn't we have met when I was just a boy and you were just a girl?
We've got to stop meeting like this -- our vet is getting suspicious.
My mother said there'd be days like this!
This is top secret so we have to use the Cone of Silence.
A Cone brothers comedy.
This is way too much intimacy for me. Let's go back to sniffing each other's butts.
You have spinach in your teeth.
You look ridiculous.
I scratch your butt, you scratch mine.
Where did everyone go?
This is awkward.
...No, YOU move!
I'm okay with cold-nosing, but no French licking.
Now hit "synch".
What is said in the cone...stays in the cone.
You really think Obama's tapping us?
What do you mean 'I've' got dog breath?
That's right. You scratch me, I scratch you.
You can't teach old woofers new tweets.
These days it's better not to look.
I promise, I'm not seeing anyone else.
People are starting to suspect.
Is your tail wagging too?
Our owners were right--our breaths do stink.
Whatever you do, don't bark!
Okay, we can talk now. No one can see us ...
No, YOU let go of the spaghetti.
We must stop meeting this way.
I'll scratch your back if you'll scratch mine.
How long are you in for?
Can you smell me now?
Your mission, Jim, should you accept it...
I'd really like to sniff your butt.
I know, but still, assume NSA is listening.
No offense, but I'd rather be sniffing your butt right now.
No, it's righty tighty, lefty loosey
I just gotta say it …our Vet has a sadistic sense of humor.
She suspects nothing.
Trust me all we have to do is on the count of 3 we each move to our right,
Jumping up on strangers. What are you 'in' for?
Look, this is going to sound crazy, but I have an idea for how we can help each other.
Your nose is wet.
Perhaps this would work better if you turned around.
If you scratch mine, I'll scratch yours.
Did you floss?
I've never been comfortable with public displays of affection
Congress
I was hoping for a different end.
One of us has to turn around in order to finish this interview.
Finally, someone who sees the world the way I do!
So I'll lick yours, you lick mine, and let's just keep this between the two of us, okay?
Just between you, me, and the lampshade.
They're right. Our breath really does stink.
I'll scratch yours if you scratch mine.
No one can tell we're talking to the Russians.
This played differently in that movie with the spaghetti.
You talkin' to me?!
Activate the Cone of Silence.
I'm seeing a side of you I've never seen.
And this is what you call witness protection.
Pooping on the Matisse rug. And you?
Now no one can see us.
Are you sure we're alone?
My tail's wagging, is yours?
Now what?
Since we met, I only have eyes for you!
I thought you said, 'Bone of Silence.'
OK, on the count of three, we both start barking
I know, I had the same dream.
My vet calls this a tête-à-tête.
All of our sessions are private and cone-fidential.
So, I take it you don't have the balls to talk about what happened either.
So, how is putting our heads together supposed to get us out of this?
You're right, I can hear the seashore!
I've been vetted too
I didn't want our barks to be "tapped
No, I don't think these things make us look stupid at all.
Well, this is awkward.
All I'm saying is that if we keep meeting like this, a breath mint wouldn't be totally out of line.
How long you in for?
In the cone zone, nobody knows you're a dog.
Some things are just better said in private.
Are you male or female?
I think your butt smelled better than your breath
Yup, yours are gone too!
Less tongue, less tongue!"
Can you keep a secret?
I see they put your cone on the wrong end also.
Do you hear an echo?
If you scratch my butt, I'll scratch yours.
You had an interesting breakfast.
STOP SHOUTING!
I guess we're both in the doghouse.
Don't bark. The echoes would deafen us.
I'll turn around if you will.
I have doggie breath? YOU have doggie breath!
You've been watching too many Get Smart reruns
You don't have to shout.
It's a chatroom. No barking.
This should stop that Russian wolfhound from eavesdropping.
Can you go on mute? I'm getting an echo.
Is this secure?
I know, but it makes it a lot harder for the microwave to spy on us.
I can't lick myself, I'm hearing echoes, and I've got tunnel vision. That's Obamacare for you.
OK but you scratch mine first.
Now what?
How about a Quid Pro Quo?
When mine gets drunk, she puts one of these on her head backwards.
Psst, you scratch my itch and I'll scratch yours.
I’m all for safe sex, but this is ridiculous!
How can you be seeing someone else?
I know what you mean. I wish they would have asked first.
Please stop yelling.
Hey Rex, can you keep a secret?
Shhh... The microwave is listening.
You know, our breath really does stink.
They said there's no proof of wiretapping, but I just feel safer this way.
Peaches is not a labradoodle, she's really a labrabeagle. Pass it on.

What??
Scratch my back and I'll scratch yours.

You're sure the NSA can't listen to us now?
I knew you'd like the echo.
Up for a quick quid pro quo?
Speak cryptically. I'm pretty sure our cones are tapped.

Ever had an itch you can't scratch?
You were right! It does work better than a hearing aid!
It's OK. They can't see us.
Now we're alone at last!
No, YOU have dog's breath.
Wow -- you have a long tongue.
"Great, now you're telling me you gave me fleas.'
Is he still President? You look. No, YOU look.
I'll lick your wound, you lick mine, and this meeting never happened.
Thank you for meeting me here, Agent Cooper. Are you absolutely sure you weren't tailed?
I know I'm preaching to the choir here.
Funny, you don't look at all like your picture.
I'm a dog?
Ha ha, you look ridiculous!
It's to prevent the microwave surveillance.
This is what I call a sub-woof-woof-er.
Do you hear an echo?
Sorry, but it was the only way I could get your undivided attention.
Bow wow wow woB
Ok, I'll scratch your itch and if you'll scratch mine.
Have you seen my tail?
I smell old shoe with a hint of cardamom.
I'll bite yours, if you bite mine.
Chief. I think Agent 99 is cheating with a German shepherd.
Just when I thought things couldn't get any more embarrassing...
I think the cats are wiretapping us.
This is just between us, Ernie.
My human prefers this face-to-face style-- not really working for me, either.
In here, it's like none of it ever happened.
We can still have sex.
I said 'PetSmart' not 'Get Smart'.
Cone-joined dogs
This isn't totally what I had in mind when I asked to speak with you in private, but okay.
I'm wagging. How about you?
Don't you love these woofers?
NO...it's the cone of shame. NOT the cone of silence...
Your breath smells as bad as your ass.
I've got a bone to pick with you.
Are you thinking what I am thinking?
Don't ask." "Don't tell.
What's with all the secrecy?
OMG, we're invisible!
What is said in the cone, stays in the cone. Agreed?
Just keep pushing, and we'll have these things off in no time.
Try wiretapping this!
You're lucky you had coverage, I have not even met my deductible yet
Let's see Obama tapp this conversation.
Are you sure this is effective against microwave surveillance?
It's a boxer rebellion. Meet here at midnight.
I'll bite yours, if you bite mine.
If we take turns turning around, it might just work.
I know; I can't lick yours either.
That was a heck of a party.
I don't think they can see us now.
I don't think they can see us.
Honestly Rex, I don't think the Russian care what we're saying to each other.
What happens in the cone of silence stays in the cone of silence.
You first. Turn around.
So it's awkward. At least, we can't be hacked.
I don't think the NSA can hear us, but I'm beginning to worry about the Russians.
So, we're just doing this for the next four years?
We can safely talk politics, now.
You back up! No, you back up!
well, now that I've got you alone...
And what are you in for?
We have nothing to be ashamed of.
Nobody asked my permission, either!
Stop barking! There's an echo in here!!!
Great, now our braces are stuck together.
When canines Skype.
Are you sure this is how babies are made?
Ok, now we can talk.
Let's tell everyone we are from France.
Together we can lick this.

Does my breath smell?" "Yeah. Does mine?
The surround sound is pretty good.
It's called a Barka.
It's annoying, but the acoustics are great.
Why are we whispering?
This is ruff.
Keep this under your hat.
Losing our health insurance won't be all bad.
Are you sure these can't be wiretapped?
I feel your pain.
See, my cone IS as big as yours.
It's the default privacy setting.
Seems a lot to give up for a little privacy.
I'll lick your stitches if you lick mine.
Let's call it a woofer.
Care for a Tic Tac?
I think our vet is kinda new...
Betty told me that Donna saw Julie talking to Gary about what Ralph was doing.
You gave it to me. No, you gave it to me.
Someone has dog breath.
Shhhh... you lick mine and I'll lick yours.
If you bite mine, I'll bite yours.
Finally, some alone time.
Believe me, they're surveilling us.
They'll never find us!
Okay, here's the plan: You lick mine and I'll lick yours.
woofle cones
I too am failing to appreciate how wearing a lampshade ever became a comedic trope.
Let's see the CIA try to hack this.
My hypothesis? A bark amplifier.
Before you say no, I just had a bath yesterday.
Magnetic dog cones were eventually deemed a failure.
Boy, the humans weren't kidding about dog breath!
I'm not supposed to date in recovery.
If we put our heads together, I bet we can get out of this situation.
Wait, don't go. I haven't finished telling you about my operation..
I’ll lick yours if you’ll lick mine.
I tell you what, I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine.
You lick mine and I'll lick yours. Deal?
If I lick yours, will you lick mine?
I like the privacy too but I kinda miss sniffing your butt.
Fleas to meet you
We’re in a secure location now, we can speak candidly.
Kinda kinky, but, personally, I prefer sniffing.
At least we have our tails.
I love how this makes your breath that much worse.
Well, at least we can kiss.
I normally don't go out on blind dates.
This is the best way to cover up my meeting with the Russian wolfhounds.
Conservatives discussing climate change.
I was chasing a car. What were you doing?
Maybe it's just the cones, but you sound about an octave higher.
So here's the deal: You lick my wound and I'll lick yours.
Why do you keep saying everything twice?
Is that your breath or mine?
Did yours get cut off too?
I thought the saying, "Put your heads together", was a metaphor?
Finally some privacy
Trade licks?
The humiliation continues.
Even the Russians can't hear us now.
Better inside a liberal bubble than out chasing alternative cats.
You're right. It's better without protection.
A hundred thousand years of symbiosis and this is what we get?
Please don't raise your voice inside here.
Do you think anyone can see us?
Now remember --- this is purely confidential.
What happens in the cone of shame, stays in the cone of shame.
I'll scratch yours if you scratch mine.
I'm wagging my tail because my reception is perfect!
Only three years, 10 months to go.

I'll lick your butt if you'll lick mine.
They think that this will stop us
I'll chew on yours if you'll chew on mine.
K-9 FOCUS Group.
Pretty sure we're a shoo in for going viral.
Lets keep this between us.
I think we're doing this wrong.
It's called docking.
I hear we are both the life of the party.
No one can tap our cone of silence.
My main food source thinks I'm his best friend.
I learned this from a French poodle.
No Barking.

From one conehead to another, our barks are worse than our bites.
Could you turn around? I can't place you.
No, you let go.
"You too? Did they really think they could teach you a new trick?
No, you be the chief. I want to be '86.
Here's the deal. I can't lick myself.
How many times do I have to tell you? NO TEXTING AND RUNNING!
Boo!
...breath mint?
Their masters' voices.
I don't know how they work either, but I too feel strangely unhorny.
So Maxwell, what happened?....Missed it by that much, Chief!
There's no way they'll find us in here.
Put your tail down so we don't look suspicious.
It's OK, we're in the cone of silence.
So this is Coney Island.
We can't let that damned cat get away with this.
Trump meets Putin at Trump Towers
We've been hacked.
Are you sure this is how puppies are made?
Put your tongue back in your mouth.
How did Lady and the Tramp do it?
Have your guy call my guy.
Thanks for meeting me like this, but I have a secret. I know who the good boy is…
They'll never find us in here!
This is what we get for crying woof.
"Your own good?" Yeah, mine said the same thing.
I'll scratch you if you scratch me
Face it - we're licked.
Your breath is heavenly... Whose garbage did you get into this morning?
You wanna breath mint?
One of us needs mouthwash.
Back up. Let's see what we're eating here.
Tell you what, I'll gnaw on your itchy stitches if you gnaw on mine.
Boris, are you sure we are not being wire tapped?
We just have to face that we look like fucking idiots here, Rex.
See Spot scheme.
Definitely, revenge is appropriate.
I hear an echo
Hello, hello, echo, echo...
Tell you what... You scratch my ears and I'll scratch yours.
Can you hear me now? ... Can you hear me now??
Quit your bitching.
It's cool. No one can see us.
You pull my stitches and I will do yours
Someone needs a mint.
We just need some time to find ourselves.
They refer to it as Facebark.
This stays under the cone of silence.
At last! No one else can see us.
Sorry, I was looking for your butt.
Nice set of canines.
I can still smell your butt.
Psst.... If you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.
Is that your breath or mine?
Are you sure we're invisible?
You hang up first. No, you hang up first.
We gotta stop meeting this way.
Can you smell me now?
Focus.
Raising your voice in this situation only makes matters worse.
No one can see us.
The microwave won't be able to read our lips.
The hounds of silence.
What's said in the cone - stays in the cone.
I'm bisexual !!
If you scratch my itch, I'll scratch yours.
Hey, you're right. I can hear the ocean.
Jeez Frank, you could really use a greenie.
This is much better…on the internet nobody knows you’re a dog!
Don't tell the cat about this.
I'll scratch your butt if you scratch mine.
Ruff day?
TrumpCare
Have you been eating onions?
Do they know the Vets only put these on us to jack the fees.
Do you think they see us?
I think the microwave can't hear us now.
So, what are in for?
Ewwww, less tongue!
Now can you hear the ocean?
So, where's your butt, anyway?
Conical visit.
I hear you but I can't see you.
If a flea bites, and one cannot see it, does it still itch?
Hey - we could hotbox the shit outta this.
Oops! Sorry, I thought that was your butt...
Activate the Cone of Silence.
Just now you change your mind about having puppies?
The squirrels will still be there - can we just talk for a minute?
Damn this magnetic trim.
Who did yours?
I'm going to bite whoever gave the cat crazy glue!
Okay, it's agreed then... I'll lick yours, then you lick mine.
That surgery was ruff.
mr. Watson, Come here - I want to see you.
re@L_d0gs_sn!ff_buttz. Now I verify your password.
No ! You move back !
The vet did what to you?
Okay, on the count of three pull back.
No, YOU get out of MY face.
No, you hang up!
So, what are you in here for?
Now I know what the vet means when she says halitosis.
What happens in the cone stays in the cone.
It was love at first sight, though I will admit we had tunnel vision...
Are they covered by the Affordable Cone Act?
On the bright side, we don't have to fuss around with contraceptives anymore.
Tunnel of Love
No YOU hang up first!
I was told this would be a blind date
It's already been seven dog minutes.
I'm just saying, Boris, there are things they do NOT want us to know.
So it's a deal? You lick mine, and I'll lick yours.
Chief, this is Max
"Cable news and tweeting to his base? Why doesn't he just sniff butts?
One of us has terrible breath.
We're invisible!
Heads or tails, it's just not working.
Are you sure they can't hear us from the microwave?
They’re tapping our cones.
It's the Code of Silence NOT CONE. .
I'd like to see that Russian Blue Cat from the embassy next door hack this conversation.
My therapist said it's time to "think outside the cone".
We can't see them, so they can't see us.
I think we're alone now.
Relax. Nobody can see us in here.
Ha, ha, ha, our masters will never see us now!
Our best hiding place yet.
No YOU hang up first!
It's a dog-meet-dog world in here.
It's agreed then. You sniff my butt and I'll sniff yours.
You don't get this virtual reality thing either?
The CIA has nothing on us !
Tee-hee! They'll never find us in here!
It's a deal. Now sniff my butt and my people will be in touch.
Your owner must have been at the Fashion Week shows too.
Heh, heh... They'll never find us in here!
I do still care but I just can't smell what you're thinking anymore.
Let's see them wire-tap this
If we just had bulbs, we could be lamps.
Next time let's just text.
First, they remove my ability to have puppies. Then, "This".
Thanks for agreeing to meet me in private.
Yeah, I was blindsided too.
Agent 99 is that you?
You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours. Deal?
Beats me? Some kind of reverse engineering.
Oops--wrong end.
I'm glad we can speak privately now, but you really have dog breath.
Two cones don't make a right.
Hell no. You turn around.
Let them wonder.
You smell mine, then I'll smell yours.
A private chat room at bitch.com.
The swift bird flies at midnight...
This is the cone of shame. No one can hear us in here." "What?
At last we can have some privacy!
Wow, it really stinks in here.
Let's make a deal on scratching.
Your breath smells amazing in here. Is that liver snaps?
Face time is always more awkward than I expect it to be.
Act natural.
If we don't see ball, does ball exist?
So whatever is said in the Cone of Silence stays in the Cone of Silence.
Think they can see us?
I never realized how MUCH you slobber, until now.
They told me if I like my vet I can keep my vet.
Shall we call it even?
Okay. You lick mine and I'll lick yours.
Hold still. The cat reads lips!
How about if I scratch your butt, you scratch mine?
Here's licking at you, kid.
Amazon hired me to deliver lampshades. You?
I have the unlimited barking plan, but the roaming charges really add up.
Whisper so the microwave won't hear us.
Whatever happened to two orange juice cans and a string?
You voted for this coverage.
Whoa, are we having an eclipse?
I'll lick yours if you lick mine.
It's as we both suspected.Thanks for looking.
Lick mine first.
The cat's been wiretapping me.
Obama has wire-tapped all my chew toys.
How disappointing. I always envisioned the "cone of silence" as being more high tech.
These hearing aids aren't very powerful.
This is the best way to avoid media leaks.
What was your co-pay?
I still can't hear you
The acoustics in here are incredible.
You're taking this Cone of Silence thing a bit too far.
Your breath is worse than your bark and your bite.
Can you scratch my butt?
For OUR own good? I don't see any on them!
What say, I'll scratch your back, if you scratch mine?
Who CARES which of us is a good dog?
I sense a bouquet of Alpo with a tinge of Milkbone
We have GOT to get ahold of PETA.
I think I like sniffing butts better.
Wrong end. Wrong end.
Do that thing with your tongue one more time and I'm out of here!
SMART CONES
I hear evil, see evil, and smell evil.
The first rule of Flea Club is: You do not talk about Flea Club.
Nothing you say to me will leave this room.
Finally, a place we can talk.
Are we seeing eye to eye yet?
Could you hum, "Who let the dogs out"?
Hear no Tump, see no Trump.
No, you turn around.
I bit the mailman, what did you do?
Let me explain, it's kinda like 'you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours'...
It's not you. It's me.
This is the first time I've sniffed the front of a dog.
Conespiricy!
So, you lick mine, I lick yours?
Careful. They may be surveiling with microwaves again.
You are taking this wiretapping paranoia a bit too far.
To be fair, they made that spaghetti kiss look so easy in the movie.
That was quite a party last night, eh?
No barking in the "Cone of Silence".
We need to bark. Plain and simple.
Your favorite Saturday Night Live skit was "the coneheads??!!" Me, too!
Let's sue for loss of consortium.
Whatever you do, don't bark!
First Rule of Cone Club: Never mention Cone Club
Are you here for the breath mint study?
Max ... are you sure the 'Cone of Silence' is really necessary?
So...what did you eat this time?
Damn, every time we meet they turn the lights out.
Let's get a second opinion.
If I lick yours, will you lick mine?
You're right, it does enhance your dog food breath.
Listen. I'll lick your stitches if you'll lick mine.
Yes, we can still do our 'hello and smell-o'!
Cone of silence activated.
These cones aren't the only thing that's emasculating.
Yes. It's the same species that developed the Mars 2020 Rover. This is the best they can come up with for us.
...and then, that bitch had the nerve to say...
This is my idea to keep deaf dogs from reading my lips.
Think they know we're in here?
Shh! I think we're being wiretapped.
No, YOU'RE shouting!
Right, so we agree to keep this whole episode in the cone?
Lucky? Is that you?
I called this closed door press briefing to address the false reports that I lack impulse control.
Sweetie, I'm sure. Our vet is a sociopath.
If we can't see them, they can't see us
My first blind date. Yours, too?
I wish my cone was this nice inside.
On the count of 3, you whine and I'll bark.
A rare look at the mating ritual of Elizabethan Collies.
Let's talk revenge
Ok then. We have a butt lickin" deal. Right?
Bow wow wow woB
you roll to the right, I will roll to the left
This sure beats lowering the Cone of Silence.
Can you turn around please?
I just wear mine for the privacy.
Alpha Dog, do you copy?
You don't have to yell.
I am not ashamed to be seen with you, I just think they're cool hats.
Where'd MY body go? Where'd YOU'RE body go?!
This bites.
The acoustics are fabulous in here!
I'll show you yours if you'll show me mine
Houston.....we have a problem!
No...I'm not seeing anyone else.
They never told us about this when we were domesticated.
Yes, but isn’t this better than getting stuck the other way?
No way Obama can wiretap us.
Not what I expected when I heard the White House wanted to test a new method to stop leaks
Usually when he says, 'roll over' it ends on a much better note.
Do you think anyone will find us?
Tunnel Vision
Granted, it may be slightly cumbersome, but it's the most secure, hack-free link I came up with.
Well, you're sniffing the wrong end, too.
Really Max. The cone of silence again.
I'll bite whatever is bothering you if you'll bite what's bothering me.
Man, these acoustics are great.
I feel ya bruh, mine itches too.
Thanks for agreeing to take the meeting given your condition.
"I guess this is what they mean by 'dog breath'".
I can't see, but tell me if I still have my Balls.
This isn't exactly what I had in mind when I said "doggy style".
Okay. Your super glue idea did work. Now what, Winnie ?
I think I stepped in something.
Yes, you do have poop breath!
Ain't this a bitch.
Psst. I'll lick yours if you lick mine.
Are these French cones?
Listen Frank. It's the same principle as the human's Chinese finger trap now just push in!
Conic Relief!
Eww, double dog breath.
Shhh... If you scratch mine, I'll scratch yours.
Great costume Max. You too 99.
What did you bite?" "A lamp
You were right honey, we can eat spaghetti in these things.
Some party last night.
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. It has been 49 days since my last confession.
Around here, everyone leaks.
OK, now lick under my left ear. Oooh. Perfect.
If they say 'roll over,' what are we going to do?
From this vantage point, you don't look as shameful.
Listen, Beldar, if anybody asks just tell them that we're from France.
Speak freely, we're in the cones of silence now.
Thank you for meeting me in my office.
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.
We're good. Even microwaves can't get through.
You chew my leg, and I'll chew yours.
This will never work—we're both too big-headed
This blows encryption away.
See, now the Patriots can't read our lips and steal our signals.
Since they cut funding to PBS, this is the only way I can avoid the Three Tenors
Trust me, this is better than end to end encryption.
Are we dogging or docking?
Tete a tete?
So this is the Cohen of silence?
What are the chances?
Aw geez, they're both woofers.
So this is the "Cone of Silence" we heard about.
I thought we could get out if we put our heads together.
Unless the CIA can hack into our smart-collars, I think we've finally got some privacy.
I think we need the other end for making puppies."
Isolationist paw-licy
I think I prefer the butt sniff.
I can hear the ocean!
We really can't keep meeting like this.
I think my food dish is monitoring me.
This support group reached capacity quickly.
Do you smell something?
Now . . . here's my plan.
Let's run away together and never look back.
A Meeting of the Blinds
You can leave the echo chamber if you want, but I'm telling you, the alternative is worse.
Yes, I know it's not perfect, but, if you scratch my itch, I'll scratch yours.
What hole in the wall!
He said the virtual reality would be completely immersive but I still itch.
How can I scratch your itch, if I can't even see it?
Remember, what I told you is confidential.
Head to head in a dog eat dog world.
You look familiar, but I can't be sure until we get these damn things off and sniff butts.
I'm backing off when the slobber gets to my nose.
Are you looking at ME?
They're saying 3 more weeks before I'm allowed near a butt again. You?
... and then Bannon said to Spicer...
Sorry. Wrong end.
Get your shame face on!
Hold still so they can't see us.
The only way to keep from hearing about politics.
Wow! I really can hear the ocean!
Just when I thought it couldn't get any more humiliating.
DIDN'T I JUST SEE YOU AT THE VET?
Air holes would've been nice.
I am all ears.
Schrodinger's dog?
You’re right - the spaghetti thing was better
What is that smell?
There - now what did you say they cut off?
Where do you want me to scratch?
You could say we're neck and neck,
When the ad said Rorschach test, I didn't realize we'd be posing for it.
The vet calls it a Chinese dog trap.
Next time let's order the lasagna.
As you can see, the operation was a success.
Ohhh yeah...that's the spot.
Okay it's settled, then: You scratch my itch, and I'll scratch yours!
Do you think your parents suspect anything?
So this is what Trump's world looks like!
How the heck are we supposed to catch balls in here?
I'm sure we can figure a way out of this if we put our heads together.
OK It's just you and me
Program is still operational but they had to phase out the microwave cameras
Alone at last.
Finally, we're alone.
Tell you what -- You scratch my ears, I'll scratch yours.
If you are that worried about wiretapping, let's just go back to barking.
Shhh...I think the microwave is watching.
Who's calling a spayed a spayed?
Good, now do my other ear; then it's your turn.
Told you mine's bigger.
Just shut up. You had me at 'bow-wow'.
Every kiss begins with Kay-nine.
Don't move I don't want the mailman to see us
I love you for your mind, Josephine, not your body.
Do you hear what I hear?
You won't believe the dumb thing my owner did today!
When they asked if I wanted a cone, I thought they meant ice cream.
Wow. Talk about dog breath!
It's my first blind date.
No, YOU turn around first.
Once we're out of recovery, we'll start again from scratch.
You scratch me and I'll scratch you.
What can I say? I like lampshades.
If you lick my butt I'll lick yours.
On our first date, we shared a cone
you scratch mine and I'll scratch yours
Between us, if this was the fashion in Shakespeare's time, count me out.
I'll scratch your back, you scratch mine.
So, Max..." - "Yes Chief?
You can be Jane Curtin and I'll be Dan Akroyd
We have to stop seeing each other this way.
Relax, Ginger did it in heels.
So glad we had this tête-à-tête.
Oh look, it's the new iCone. They're using FaceTime.
If they had bothered to do a little user interface research, they could have fixed this design flaw a long time ago.
Welcome to my sphere of influence.
I always say, to gnaw yourself is to know yourself.
We have to stop meeting like this.
What happens in the cones stays in the cones. Got it?
Scooby would know what to doo.
Remind me never to play fetch with you again
They're offering free postage and handling if we buy two items.
Wait! I think we are picking up Trump Tower.
Damn! They got yours too!
Trust me - your bark is now worse than your bite.
Now this is a secure connection!
Max, I've asked for the Cone of Silence to tell you that Chaos found a way to turn us into dogs!
Okay, what's so important that we need the Cone of Silence?
I'm the one with dog breath?
We can't be seen together.
Really?! I hear the ocean too!
You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours, Donald.
Oops--wrong end.
Is 2020 here yet?
Stop copying me.
The acoustics are amazing in here!
Finally, we're alone.
This 'Lady and the Tramp' sequel needs a bit of work.
So how long have you been on Facebark?
There is no barking in the cone of silence.
How government secret classified information is really shared.
is this as humiliating for you, as it is for me?
This would be way better if your cone was on your butt.
So near, and yet so far.
Could you lick something for me?
I'll gnaw on your stitches if you gnaw on mine.
Frankly, I'd rather be licking my nuts.
The Russian Wolfhounds can't hack us now!
pity party at the dog park
I can't see a thing!....Who said that??
Where you headed?
You too?
Maybe if we stay like this, Trump will go away.
Okay, Tuesday, at the dog park.
From Dog's mouth to your ears...
My right!
They'll never know we're licking each other's nose.
I asked you not to tell me that, Agent 99

I'm in for felony wound licking. What are you in for?
Agent Smart reporting, chief.
Keep it down. The microwave is listening.
Fifi taught me a new position...
Woof." "I know, it's, like, whatever.
Next time we do this, go easy on the onions at lunchtime, ok?
How's my breath?
Should we say Between You and I or Between You and Me?
So, how long are ya in for?
Are you thinking what I am thinking?

Shirley, I have eyes for no one but you.
I think that Fluffy is on to us.
Have you been licking your butt again?
Well you told me you weren't a fan of PDA.
Well it beats solitary conefinement.
Here's my plan.
Fancy meeting you here.
Can you keep a secret?
I'll be wearing mine until the next election.
"We've got to stop meeting like....Wait a minute! You're not Coco!

The cats have taken over KAOS, Agent 99.
We are one with the "cone of shame"...
There's an echo on my side, are you hearing one too?
We need a string for it to work over distance.
Has anyone ever mentioned that you have dog breath?
I'll bark less and wag more if you will.
"It's just that, sometimes I feel like you don't see me".
What are you in for?" "What's an Elizabethan?
You need to brush your teeth...
I didn't even know anything was broken.......
Two cones, one bone.
I said, "Shuffle, Shuffle, Step. Not, Shuffle, Step, Shuffle!" Submitted by my daughter: Jessica Paul
It wasn't so dark when we were a three-dog night.
I know it's Fashion Week, but don't you think an Elizabethan collar is really a bit too retro?
My name's Vladimir, what's yours?
Small world, isn't it?
I don't think this will stop the leak.
I'm not ashamed! Are you?
Scratch my back." "No, you scratch my back.
Finally, we can eat spaghetti together without it ending up on YouTube...
I feel like I'm talking into an echo chamber these days
I know we've never met, but I feel oddly connected to you.
So THIS is why they call it the cone of shame!
Forgive me, Fido, for I have sinned.
Ready to scare some cats?
You lick mine, then I'll lick yours. Deal?
My ears? You should see your ears!
Fox! Fox! Fox! - - Breitbark! Bark! Bark!
No Max! Not the cone of silence!
I told you your doghouse was being tapped.
But, do we need a Cone of Silence?
Private conversation
My collar was hacked.
Vets discovered the cones used after surgery ,were a great help with "hard of hearing" dogs.
Houston, we have contact
Watch what you say. I think mine is wiretapped.
This isn't exactly what I had in mind.
Ok guy this is how it works. I scratch yours...
Yep, they neutered me too. What say we start a consultancy practice together?
Rin Tin Tinder hookup
I thought he said, "We're moving back to the 'hood'.
Yeah, and I'll scratch yours. Just like the lawyer in the house says.
t last! We finally meet face to face.
Ther're used to prevent concussions.
Your place was wiretapped also?
This beats smelling our behinds.
Never thought we'd have to employ the cones of silence again
Have we met before? Please turn around so I can identify you.
Cone of shame? They told me it was the cone of silence!
What was that, Chief?
I only have eyes for you.
Some kind of dog virtual reality thing
So much for swiping right based on the wrong photo.
As the trend to repeal civil right continued, "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" made a staggering comeback.
Alright, here's the plan to steal Butch's food.
OK, who barks first?
Don't bark so loud.
We may be in an ideological echo chamber, but at least we see eye to eye.
The Chinese Dog Trap
My tongue's not long enough.
Bitch.
What do we do next, Bannon?
It's ok to speak freely..they can't hear us..we're under the cone of silence .
This isn't exactly what that RCA dog was doing, but it probably would have been if they'd had stereo then.
Woof? Woof.
These collars work great for giving us privacy to lick each other's faces, but will they also fit around our waists?
I really like the privacy of these things.
Better than the other end
I wish they had these things for butts.
Are you sure those Russian Wolfhounds can't hear us?
A kissing dog never bites.
Okay, now that we have some privacy, here's the plan....
Coneheads! Somebody call SNL!
Do you hear the ocean? I don't hear the ocean. They assured me I'd hear the ocean.
Just behind the left ear there, ahh, yes.
This way we cannot be hacked
Phew! Got tired of smelling the other end
Remember, what happens in the cones stays in the cones.
The commercial said our snouts should start looking smaller in days
I only have eyes for you.
Ok, when I said if we put our heads together, we could probably figure a way out of these...um this isn't exactly what I meant.
It's not so bad now that we're allowed conjugal visits.
Time to call Ben Carson?
If you see something, say something.
This was NOT my idea of a blind date.
Can we stay like this until the next election?
It looks like we're now stuck with the American Vet Care Act.
Want to make out?
How do you like our new secure communication system?
There's no way the cat will find us now.
I can't be sure, but I think our licking days are over!
I laid down with the neighbors dog and got up with fleas.
OK, what's the plan?
Do you feel a draft?
Are you sure no one suspects we've been seeing each other?
You might try Listerine.
For your ears only ...
I'll turn around first.
I don't think the humans can see us now.
DON'T BITE MY HEAD OFF!
So, what are we missing here?
Haven't we met somewhere before
Let's see them tap this conversation.
You chew my stitches and I'll chew yours.
I guess Trump was serious about the new security measure.
Look at me when I'm barking at you!
What echo-echo-echo?
I will if you will.
It's annoying but I got a killer tan.
Another one of your master's brilliant ideas?
Did you hear? Bob's leaving.
Do I have the wrong end?
The last time I mentioned where the kibble is, it ended up on WikiLeaks. I’m just sayin’.
tent-a-tent
No one will find us now
Hi, Beldar, I'm Premack.
Humans are monsters.
I'll lick you if you lick me.
At least Yuri can't intercept us now
Stuck in the middle with you
Okay, you gnaw my leg and I'll gnaw yours.
How will we be able to tell when one of us blinks?
Believe me... I so understand. You are preaching to the choir.
It's important we spend time at this end too!
It's a dog meet dog world.
Everything that happens in the cone of silence stays in the cone of silence.
Your nose is warm. Should I worry?
A million hits minimum and we get diddly-squat.
What are you looking at?
Come just a little closer.
And I say it's prostate, not prostrate!
It's not like it's a Rubik's cube—just let go of the rope!
Theirs was a forbidden love...
I heard it from the horse's mouth.
You too?
did you say quid pro quo?
I'm not allowed to butt sniff either.
I told you if we did this they'd draw a cartoon about us!
Quick, I think we're alone.
#@doggerheads
Do you really think Princess can lipread?
Do you know what halitosis means?
They call this "insider trading."
I say we call a spay a spay.
The acoustics are great!
Okay, 99, this is the new Cone of Silence.
Bite me.
First-time dog whisperers.
Would you mind repeating that?
How about if you lick mine and I lick yours
Rex, I think your plan for Canine Facebook needs a bit of tweaking.
Given the current political climate, I'm glad we can see eye-to-eye for a change.
You let go first.
I hope the operation worked. I'm tired of being conjoined.
I hate Daisy's new haircut, but keep that in the cone of silence, okay?
Tunnel of Love
No shame in experimenting with the latest in canine attachment-based therapy.
What do you think about adopting?
They told me we were going to the park! The cat has been talking about revolution, I'm in.
You'll have to sniff my nose instead........
We've got to stop meeting like this. My wife is calling the Vet.
We'll just tell 'em we travel in our own circles...
Are we well-connected, or what?
Are you looking at ME?
I detect an echo.
Honestly, Biggie, part of me doesn’t want to know why.
I'm afraid to look.
It smells like your butt in here
Here's the deal. You chew out the stitches on my leg and I'll chew out the ones on yours.
Very funny...yes...I can hear you now
Okay, I turn around and you get to sniff, then we both turn around and I get to sniff.
Doesn't this seem counter-intuitive to YOU?
Cone with me.
Hey, do you think you can scratch behind my ear?
This is my first ever blind date.
Your tail or mine?
Just below the ear…down a bit…
Do you think the microwave can still hear us?
Dogs memorizing for Bark Mitzvah.
I got the idea from watching Get Smart.
I miss pee-mail.
Finally, we can eat our pasta in peace.
Can we talk?
The fix is in.
Are we wiretap proof yet?
Yes, we are docking, but it is not exactly what I had in mind.
I'll chew yours if you chew mine!
I'm sure we can figure this out if we put our cones together.
Can you hear me now?
If you see something, say something.
I just can't believe they would do that to me.
Okay..I'll lick yours if you lick mine. Now how do we deal with the toilet bowl problem.
I heard this is the only way to avoid a wiretap.
Who needs E-Harmony and Tinder when folks like us can still meet the old fashioned way?
It's nice to share bones, in our private cones!
Peek-a-boo
Didn't you love that anesthesia?
Supposedly it's shameful to share spaghetti.
If you try to itch mine I'll try to itch yours.
There's no way Trump will be President." "So true.
Your lips taste like penicillin.
Ready for our doo-et?
You're blocking my signal.
Okay, so here's how we'll get the butter from the counter without the microwave seeing...
Dog Encryption
Is this the best we could do in our security upgrade?
Is this how we mate?
Is this up close and personal enough for you?
I've never smelled a butt like this before...
Is this what they mean by tunnel vision?
Are we really in the cone of silence?
Hello, Darkness, my old friend.
This way they can't read our lips.
You do mine. I'll do yours.
Can you hear the ocean?
It's a deal. You lick my sore and I'll lick yours.
Agent 86, do we have to use the cones of silence?
I feel your shame.
You were right, your nose is still cold!
Are your sure this is how we make America great again?
I got a tick, but you need a Tic-Tac.
Okay, Max, what's so important that we need the cones of silence?
This probably wasn't the best time for a 'Lady and the Tramp' reënactment.
Your breath smells familiar.
I'll lick your ear, you lick mine.
I can't take my eyes off you.
What must the children think!
It's just 28 years, Buddy...
You're all I see.
Are you sure nobody can tap us?
The shades are drawn-now what?
Canine Conference Call
Give me the spaghetti.
They can't stop us from licking in here.
Flynn, that you?" "Yes, I think we've established a secure com line now. So as we were saying about sanctions...
I will scratch your nose if you scratch mine.
Okay, here's the plan...
What is it, Agent 86?
'First Conetact'
They said 'get a room' but this works I guess...
We're just not seeing nose to tail on this issue.
This conversation stays inside the bubble
Don't worry, Donald! Even the Brits can't tap into our Cones of Silence!
Ummm, whose nose do we follow?
When I pee I pass "Wikileaks."
Hush up, they're listening through our microchips.
Cone here often?
How 'bout a French kiss?
Lamp shade disease spreads rampantly in canine population.
No, YOU look silly in that thing!
Tell you what... You scratch my ears and I'll scratch yours.
Are you sure this is how Nipper got started?
Max, is that you? I can't see a thing.
Boy, Our breath really is bad!
I'll lick your wound if you'll lick mine.
Boy, I could REALLY go for a sno-cone.
Read my lips.
Rookie surveillance dogs
This is fun, but nothing beats licking my butt.
Somehow, the spaghetti thing doesn't seem as cute now.
French kiss in a double cone.
Ha! Joke's on them - they'll never find us in here!
You may now kiss the bride.
When you said you didn't like public displays of affection, I didn't know this is what you had in mind.
Dog collar, wiretap—same thing!
Silly me. My owners promised me a cone and I thought they meant ice cream cone. Fool me once....
I wish I could spin my head like Linda Blair.
I know, right? Don't tell the dachshund.
Did Verizon cut you off too?
Your breath stinks.
At least no one can read our lips.
Two words: Breath mint.
Finally putting these awkward items to good use!
Now that we've done the bark part of this stupid study, why don't we fake the bite part.
You have to let me know next time you intend to wear this.
Let's keep this quiet. . .
Can you keep this under your hat?
Are you listening?
Ok, now what??
No worries - It's all in the cone of silence.
That's a deal then, yea? You scratch my leg and I'll scratch yours.
Smells like Friskies in here.
You lick my wound, I'll lick yours
I only have eyes for you, too.
Facetime for dogs.
Finally we can eat our spaghetti in private.
Stuck in the lampshade again. You?
Our owners don't deserve us.
They should have done this at Trump Tower.
Now that we're alone...
so, who is your vet?
So here's the deal...when there gone, you kick some of the leftovers into this thing, and I'll do the same for you.
If they're trying to listen, they're barking up the wrong tree.
Victoria meets Albert
WHEN I SAID I WOULD MEET YOU IN PRIVATE I DID NOT MEAN THIS!!!!
Now that we've tricked them into giving us the "cone of silence," we can make our plans.
If you scratch my nose, I'll scratch yours.
DOGONIT!!
Have I told you lately that I love you?
The security system looks primitive
It could even be the microwave....
I told you: no more spaghetti until the stitches come out!
At least you sired a litter first
Well, I say we blame it on the mailman.
Do you hear an echo in here?
Did your French bulldog friend teach you this?

What is that thing you are wearing? Mine is a lampshade.
Chief? Max?
One of us has really bad breath.
Let's get some ice cream.

I don't think they'll find us in here.
Dear God, there's a terrible echo in here.

You chew my stitches, I'll chew yours.
I can't either.
Are you sick? Your nose is warm.
I'm just saying, "You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours."
Do you think anyone knows we're having an affair?
Do me a favor and bite the flea on my left butt. A little spritz would be nice too.
I thought they said 'dog scone'. What about you?
Do you think that they can hear us in here?
I'll lick your wounds, then you lick mine!
With these 'cones of silence' they'll never know we can talk!
I know this looks silly but at least the microwave can't hear us.

I think I hear an echo.
OK Here's the plan... You lick where mine used to be and I'll do the same for you...
No. You tell me what you're wearing.
This way we can't be tapped by the microwave.
so I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine...
Would you mind if I'm seeing someone else?

On woof, you gnaw my stitches and I'll gnaw yours.
You dog, you!
In case they are wiretapping our leashes.

You don't look like a dog to me.
"Don't tell" - pass it on.
So this is what they mean by privacy.
Psst, don't let the humans hear!
Avoiding Wiretaps!
Let's put an end to dog eat dog and have a meeting of minds.
Why do they always grab the hose when someone yells, "The dogs are stuck together again!"?
No, no - listen, here's the deal - you lick mine and I'll lick yours...
These damn things preclude our usual greeting, so hi there.
Houston, we have no problem. We have successfully interbred U.S. and Soviet canine ear mites.
Okay, I'll lick yours and you lick mine. But don't tell.
Remember, what happens in the kennel, stays in the kennel.
Could you please turn around?

Me neither, no more political stuff, too ruff.
Bo can't hear us.
It could be worse. What if we were ostriches?
Yes, they gave me one too when we moved to Washington.
It seems like uncertainty is the new norm, so you just learn to live with it.
Nobody can laugh at us in here.
Your breath tells me that bidet might be a good investment.
Do you want to try tongue kissing?
Sorry! Wrong channel. Loking for April the giraffe to see if the baby has arrived yet.
Hopefully Beldar & Prymaat will let us 'consume mass quantities' once we're discovered.
Isn't this is a more civilized way to get to know each other?
Now we can finally kiss with out the puppies looking.
Great invention, Cody___mutes all their annoying commands.
So much for chasing our tails.
