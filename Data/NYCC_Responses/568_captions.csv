Our timeshare presentation will begin in about 5 minutes.
If you get a choice the East River is nice.
Grammatically, indeed it IS sleep with the fish, not 'fishes'.
So Vito tells me you're leaving the organization.
How was your flight in on United?
Bob tells me you're reconsidering our offer.
So when are you two taking the plunge?
Well, we did tell you it was your going away party!
I'm taking the bridge home--I'd be happy to drop you off on my way.
when you said you were tied up, I assumed you wouldn't be coming.
Your first time in New Jersey?
On behalf of the airline, I offer our sincerest apologies for the inconvenience, and invite you to enjoy our hospitality suite while you await your re-accommodation.
I know this isn't the kind of farewell party you were expecting.
It's so nice to see couples that still do things together.
I didn't want to come, either.
Ah, you're reporters from the N. Y. Times. Welcome to the White House. Feel free to wander around and ask the administration staff anything you'd like.
I've arranged for you to be dropped off on your way home.
The president would like to offer each member of the press a complimentary glass of wine.
Yes, we're drunk and will probably regret this in the morning.
So, how do you two know the Corleones?
The condo board was unanimous
I was on that diet once, too.
Unfortunately, ' Let me go' does not qualify as a final request.
Here, this should help loosen you up a bit.
Typical. His bucket is 78% larger than yours.
But enough about me, what have you two been up to?
That's nothing; let me tell you about my day.
You'll want the white wine. It goes better with fish.
At first glance, the condo board rules may seem harsh.
So I said to President Trump, lets invite a few TV reporters.
You must be the Snitches!
Try not to think about it.
You must be the hostages.
I'm so glad you'll be staying for my timeshare presentation.
It could be worse- it could be me.
No, I wouldn't want to be in your shoes.
I'm getting notes of despair; a hint of foreboding.
We have ways of making you small-talk.
Well, this sounds like a very specific dating site.
I'd love to help you, but, ironically, my hands are tied.
Looks like you've reached the last thing on your bucket list.
How nice of you to stay for my poetry reading.
Looks like you two are ready to make the plunge.
So what's your safe word?
But enough about me.
My husband and I never do anything together any more.
Mine are Gucci. I take it yours are Gambino?
Salvatore tells me you sing.
I gave specific instructions to pot the plants - not plant the Potts.
But enough about me! How did you two meet?
White House correspondent! How fascinating!
Let me call you a car service—will you be going to the Hudson or East?
I agree. Everybody thinks they're a victim these days.
How embarrassing, I told Tony I wanted you to speak with the Fishers.
Peter tells me it took a little coercion on his part to get you here.
Here's to low tide.
Can I interest you in a Burgundy while Rocco clears out the trunk?
You must be the Victims....I've heard so much about you.
I get it - it's gallows humor, only more concrete.
And then, on my sixth birthday...
So how do you know Vito?
It isn't often I have a captive audience.
I'm glad to see that you both decided to stay.
You wouldn't believe the day I've had.
...and then I adopted my fourth cat, and his story is even better than the first three.
I know, believe me, I've had my own run-ins with the homeowners' association!
Sounds like a rough day, but I'm sensing the worst part isn't over.
Once more after me, You're doing the best job ever, Mr. President.
Bon Voyage doesn't sound quite right, but you know what I mean.
I see you two are finally taking the plunge.
And then I had a yeast infection for 2 whole years....
Well, I've held you captive long enough...
I see you flew in on United.
Well, it's performance, but is it art?
So you're the parents who donated the Make America Great Again hats to the school auction.
I see you have read and agreed to our new Terms of Service.
We're putting you in the high-risk pool.
"Which one of you ordered the cabernet to die for"?
We had such high hopes for you as new club members, but then you asked for Merlot.
The Catalano Family Vineyards would like you reconsider portions of your Chianti review.
Are you part of the exhibit, or should I call the police?
You know what happens to parents who let their twelve year old daughter submit a caption.
This is what happens when you bring merlot.
I know I'm not supposed to talk to the art, but do you have the WiFi password?
Would you feel more comfortable out on the terrace?
When I said 'come as you are,' I didn't realize you were in the middle of something.
You two are making quite the splash tonight.
How long can you stay?
Are you two together?
This Chardonnay pairs very well with fish.
It's simply an overbooking situation. I trust you both understand.
You say you're in cement? My uncle was in cement. Made a fortune.
Well, I'd say you're going easy on yourselves considering you voted for him.
What does your Fitbit say now?
If it's any consolation-- these new shoes are killing me too
I see you've met my husband.
There are few artists as sensitive to criticism as Mr. Gaspari.
So, how long have you two Democrats been in Washington?
This is just so much more effective than asking for a "Suggested Donation."
Maybe this will help you loosen up a little.
Would you mind taking a few minutes to complete an exit survey?
Of course, many customers with free accounts eventually decide to upgrade
I hate these going-away parties, don't you?
We probably won't see each other again, but it was lovely to meet you.
Can I get you anything.?
Well, I think the bucket challenge thing has gotten out of control.
Would it have killed you to delete your Yelp review?
I hope that you didn't feel obligated to come.
Sorry, I'm afraid you have pre-existing conditions.
Let me show you the pool.
I'll let you two mingle.
Look, I don't mean to keep you.
So what sort of "family business" are you in exactly?
Care for a drink while the concrete sets?
Don’t you just hate these events? Everyone acts so restrained.
You two are fantastic listeners.
Last call!
They're all out of straws.
One more round before we drop you off?
You know, when you tell a host that you'll be tied up, you're not supposed to show up.
You two together?
Finally! A captive audience!
Mainly acquisitions and hostile takeovers. And you two?
Actually, no two AA chapters are exactly alike.
Look at it this way, in a few months you're going to lose you health insurance anyway.
I admire your restraint.
Sorry. I should have warned you not to discuss politics tonight.
These faculty parties are much more enjoyable once you make tenure.
Do you by any chance have a rent-controlled apartment?
A final toast to cement our relationship.
Let me tell you about my grandkids.
No - he really like you both. Usually it's straight to the river."
Have you reconsidered giving a donation?
Welcome to the Houdini Club initiation.
Would you care for a canapé while the cement dries?
I take it, you're the Magicians?
Thanks for agreeing to see my baby’s photos.
I hear that you two are finally taking the plunge.
Can I get your apartment?
Let this be a lesson to you and others like you that listen to NPR but never donate.
'So you're the designated drivers.'
I hear you're moving to the East River.
and then when I was 23, ....am I boring you?
Wikileaks has been so helpful identifying regular listeners who never pledge during the fundraising drive.
You really shouldn't have said you voted for Trump. People get upset.
Let me guess. This is the last item on your bucket lists.
You're such good listeners.
Remind me, what time do you need to be at the dock.
Why so pail?
I'm afraid I have some more bad news: Someone just walked in with a guitar.
You're so lucky it was low tide!
Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.
Well it must be working. You both look very thin.
You're such good listeners.
Now be honest, how surprised were you guys?
Thanks for coming. Can I offer a drink to loosen you up?
He used to just say "You're Fired!" but now he's getting serious
Just tell us why you voted for Trump.
A toast to cement your relationship
I understand you'll be joining us for the midnight cruise.
You have to get here by 6:00 to avoid the mob.
eHarmony huh?
Is this performance art or did you touch a painting?
Well, I told you not to say who you voted for.
This should loosen you up.
I haven't even begun my bucket list yet!
... oh, let me know if you've heard this one before ...
Since you are my husband's fourth and final mistress, I'd like to propose a toast.
This reminds me of the last time I saw Jimmy Hoffa
So how do you know Vito?
Suddenly, Bob Mankoff looks like a genius!
So YOU'RE tonight's sacrifice? How awkward.
But enough about me... where do you see yourselves in five years?
You couldn't just leave your cell phones at home?
I hear you two are about to make quite a splash!
On the bright side, it's a great way to see the East River.
Lucky you -- the river is always lovely in the spring!
That's terrible, but can I tell about MY problems?
Fabulous going away party!
Would that a fish were the worst thing I ever slept with.
Wow! So you're actual tortured artists?
But enough about me.
Enough about me. What have you two been up to?
First time to Mar-a-Lago?
I see you've met my 3-year-old.
Did you send your kid to our school with a peanut butter sandwich?
So, can I count on your support?
Let me guess...media?
This is how we deal with gate crashers at Mar-a Lago.
This is the 'Wine Appreciation' class. 'Bondage for Beginners' is next door.
I had to be dragged here too.
Can I get you a straw?
But don't let me keep you.
I bet you two won't make that mistake again.
So you two finally decided to tie the knot.
Yours, I am afraid, is a pre-existing condition.
I'm enjoying being single. I don't want to be tied down at this point.
So you're not going to the after-party?
I know they say red wine doesn't go with fish, but would you like a sip?
What a relief! I've always wanted a captive audience.
Sorry. The magician we hired had to leave suddenly.
So where do you two see yourselves in the next five minutes?
No, I can't say I have ever slept with a fish.
Of course you'll stay for dinner?
I've noticed you two haven't been mingling.
I see I have a captive audience
At this point, does it really matter, red or white?
Darlings, I absolutely didn't expect you. The Gambinos said you wouldn't be coming.
Our host thought you might be interested in hearing why I voted for Donald Trump.
So what part of "surprise party" don't you understand?
The important thing is that you showed up.
That's amazing. I only lost 6 pounds on it, but my husband wasn't as supportive as yours.
So how exactly did you get here?
You think that's cutting edge? You should see what Lady Gaga's wearing.
Would you like your glass half-empty or half-full?
What offer did you refuse?
What type of art are you?
So now you DO want to hear my screenplay idea?
I told my husband you were bound to be here.
The president assures you that it's standard procedure for all our guests who are members of the press.
What's the opposite of "cheers"?
So, Jan tells me that you had a little trouble with your United flight?
I couldn't help noticing your shoes.
Its a screwdriver. I thought when you said 'Get me a jackhammer' any tool-themed drink would do.
Any more thoughts about trying to leave early?
Sorry, it's just until I finish telling you about my conversion to Veganism.
Then I met my second husband...
Must you always play the victims?
Maybe we can split an Uber later? Looks like you're headed toward the East River, too.
Great going away party!
The wine will go well with the fishes.
Well that's one way to cement a relationship.
Next time don't bring crackers that contain gluten.
I love a captive audience.
I see you've embraced the new healthcare plan
.....and this is why you should never discuss politics.
I realize it's unorthodox, but we have to do something with the people who don't make tenure.
We thought it would be nice to give you a little send off.
So how's the witness protection thing working out?
Not drinking tonight?
I didn't know the Vice President was into performance art.
You know that's exactly why my husband and I decided we wouldn't sign a prenuptial agreement
Of course I am still pro life
But is it art?
So, how do you two know David?
Oh yes, we are VERY serious about RSVPs.
You must be the couple that offended "you know who" by talking during his toast at tonight's State Dinner.
So, when did you tie the knot?
Ah, you must be the holdovers from the last Administration.
I'm so glad you decided to stay.
Have to admit I wasn't expecting to get such good advice from members of the outgoing administration!
You're merely an outward expression of what we all feel.
Would you care for some Chardonnay while the concrete sets up?
When did you decide to leave the Witness Protection Program?
You'll be fine. They're just putting you in the 'High Risk Pool.'
Do you prefer full sunlight or shade?
Going so soon?
So, you must be the performance artists.
How can you BOTH forget your safe word?
Oh you'll just love the view of the Brooklyn Bridge from the East River
Sorry! AllI said was "Chill the whites".
And WHAT dating site did you meet on?
Instead of a blindfold taste tasting, we decided to make it more challenging
Those shoes are just to die for!
Tell me if you've heard this one already...
Looks like you two are going to be in over your heads here tonight.
I feel like a hostage at these events, too.
I thought you two would hit it off.
I'll let the Fishes know you've arrived.
Can I get you some water?
To be honest, I don't want to be here either.
Would you like this to go?
Don't know what you two said to the boss, but, it looks like you're going places.
The designated drivers, I presume?
I'm going to ask one last time, where is my garden gnome?
I was told if this won't loosen you up, nothing will.
Do you have any shellfish allergies?
Well, make yourselves comfortable.
This has notes of desperation.
Oh, come on. Drink up- you only live once.
So, how do you know Tony?
Straw?
Just don't stand there - mingle!
Don't move. I'll be right back!
Keep stomping. We need about twenty more glasses.
Let me guess: You both spoke truth to power.
Of course, all donations are voluntary.
Sorry, your children will not pay the ransom.
Now we'll see how you like double-dipping.
Planter fascism?
A Chenin Blanc will give you more buoyancy.
Enough about me, what's new with you two?
Don't you hate it when someone shows up wearing the same outfit?
I can't tell if this is modern art or a hostage situation.
How's your expose' on the mafia going?
Sorry, the President did not accept your apology.
I'm sorry, but your hands are tied, and our decision is set in stone.
I recommend the white Zin, it goes much better with fish.
How about a drink to loosen up?
So, what's next on the old bucket list?
So what else is on your bucket list?
Small world – my husband was a snitch.
I'm not boring you, am I?
Would the designated drivers like a teensy sip?
Wouldn't joining AA be easier?
No more wine for you. You're already potted
So I hear you two are going to take the plunge!
So how do you know Fat Tony?
Don't just stand there. Mingle!
The Friendly Skies would like to comp you with a complimentary beverage
Don't worry. Soon you'll be back on the president's good side.
Well, I never expected to see you two here.
Harold, let's get these for the pool!
Stay here. I'll be right back.
I hear the East River is beautiful this time of year
So, how long will you be art?
Could I at least get you some fresh gags?
You'll love the seafood
We frown on boxed wine.
I would offer you a drink, but I see your hands are tied.
You two are on my Bucket list.
I told you this party was going to be a mob scene!
Can I pour some wine down your throat?
Yes, I would like to hear what's next on your bucket list.
Just be thankful you didn't come to the blind tasting.
Looks like you had the same bucket list.
You must be the two artists about to join the Hudson River School.
Well, my life plan is not as concrete as yours.
And how do you two know the Sopranos?
....so, while Macy's had the right color, the heel was the wrong height, so then I went to DSW....
Well, you knew it was a farewell party.
Now don't feel like you have to stay.
I would have chosen Canada, but I do respect your choice.
Finally! A captive audience!
I almost wore that same dress tonight.
The S&M party was last night.
Leave it to Saint Laurent to use rope and bucket so ironically.
Since you have nothing to lose, would you mind tasting my drink to see if it's poisoned?
Emma, Colin, I'm sure you didn't mean to skip over my far-superior caption!
So, as House Republican members, did you feel any pressure to vote for the American Health Care Act?
Love your costumes! Which Russian politicians are you supposed to be?
So, how'd you guys get roped into this party?
So, what's on your bucket list?
I guess they are really serious about weeding out the office romances.
There you are!! I figured you two were either tied up or planted yourselves in a corner.
I can see you're in a bit of a bind.
Let me get you two a drink. Wait right here.
I'm glad you came. I thought that you two would have a lot in common.
Thanks for staying. It means a lot.
So you thought "the Fishes" were a couple.
I'll deny I said this, but your reviews were spot-on.
Now this is what I call a captive audience!
I always feel awkward talking to people in your situation.
How is that witness protection program working out?
You should know that not all of us think you're rats.
How was your flight?
Are you performance art or did you really do something naughty?
I would really love to help, but I'm afraid my hands are tied.
So who asked whom to tie the knot?
We realize our interview process is a little more challenging than most companies.
No, no, that's not the way the ice bucket challenge works.
For what it's worth, I thought having a goodbye party was a bit excessive.
You know, if you had mentioned you were "literally" tied up, I wouldn't have insisted.
Oh, enough about me, I can't wait to hear what you folks have been up to.
Of course, "free cruise" lends itself to broad interpretation.
Something to drink while the cement sets?
Jeez, I never thought of doing that for birth control.
It's always awkward to run into my clients like this.
Stomp on those grapes faster! Merlot won't make itself!
That's precisely why I don't buy shoes online.
While we wait for the cement to dry, can I get you a straw?
So...how are you liking the Houdini Emersion program?
So you must be the parents of the artist.
I think every cocktail party should have designated listeners.
I'm sure it'll blow over. Lord knows, I have my own family problems.
I remember my own hazing like it as just yesterday!
Would you prefer white, it goes better with fish.
Maybe next dinner party, you'll bring the dish you were assigned to bring
Adam, I knew you had met a girl, but you didn't tell me that you had tied the knots.
You two must be journalists.
Well, my bucket-list is less austere
Let me guess--you voted for Trump, or you hated Hamilton?
I knew you two were bound to show up.
Sal tells me you're both informants.
So how do you know the captors?
...and THEN you can apply for a Green Card?
So, who's going to be the first volunteer to taste Trumps new brand "Sour Grapes " ?
Adding designated listeners to these cocktail parties is such a good idea.
So how do you know Fat Tony?
I have read about the Mafia diet, but wanted to wait until after the holidays.
I honestly didn't know there was a thirteenth step.
Do your best to mingle.
Let me tell you why Hillary should have won...
Terribly sorry, but we had run out of sacrifices
I see you lost the caption contest.
Do you have a designated diver?
...and the water there is so clear, you can see all the way to the bottom. You'll absolutely love it!
I've never had such a captive audience.
So you guys must be the designated drivers...
No, this is the 'Drinking like Fishes' seminar. 'Sleeping with the Fishes' is down the hall.
Well yes, the invitation did say, 'Come as you are.' I am intrigued, however.
So, how do you know Mr. and Mrs. Corleone?
Welcome to the witness protection program.
Would a straw help?
I guess the Family thinks you two shouldn't get married.
I'm guessing you're designated?
Still won't talk, eh? Let's see if you can withstand the tedious banter of my party guests.
On behalf of that Mar-a-Lago Initiation Committee - Congratulations for making it this far.
Consider what would happen if we ALL neglected our condo fees!
I've been noticing that other people seem to be avoiding you.
When Vinny invited me, he never mentioned it was a going away party.
You guys really should walk around and mingle instead of planting yourselves right there.
Listen, no one is forcing you to be here.
"I agree! These cocktail parties are pure torture!
Where in Sheepshead Bay--as if I really have to ask.
So, you both worked on the Hillary campaign?
You appear to have a pre-existing condition.
It may seem harsh, but we can't have people putting ice cubes in red wine.
Will you be around next week?
I love a captive audience.
How nice,you're both recovering alcoholics.
You really need to loosen up a bit.
I like when I have a captive audience.
Now, isn't this better than sitting on a Grand Jury?
Well it's very brave of you to show up tonight....
I am so sorry about this low tide mix up. Why don't you both stay, mingle, and we'll try throwing you off the pier again in six hours.
You two look like a fun couple!
Can I drop you off somewhere after the party?
"Enjoying the 'going-away-party'?
Well what did you expect showing up with a Merlot?
I'm not very good at farewell toasts.
Welcome to Brooklyn. Some things haven't changed.
A drink to loosen you up?
This is how we torture wine snobs. Now watch me drink this red wine out of a white wine glass.
I heard it was a real mob scene here last night.
I see you are from the press corps!"
Since you'll be having the fish tonight, may I suggest this excellent Sicilian pinot?
I just love how you two do everything together.
The drinks are just to lighten the termination process.
I knew you were bound to show up.
Oh my. Did I misuse "literally" again?
I'm impressed. The chairman doesn't usually go in for such elaborate send offs.
I think you two are somewhat confused about the ice water challenge.
The East River IS lovely this time of year.
So what's your safe word?
I really didn't want to come to this party either.
Ahhh...I see I have a captive audience
Lately this place is a mob scene.
May I drop you off?
It's so refreshing to actually see someone follow through on their Election Night promises!
I hope I'm not boring you?
Now THIS is my kind of parent-teacher conference.
Have a drink before you head toward the pier.
Sorry, the cruise is overbooked.
Well, they specifically said "no social media" during the ceremony.
Chapter One "I am born"
Bottoms up
No offense, but I never understood performance art
I believe the term "invitation only" speaks for itself.
Once this little meet and greet is over, the co-op Board will give your application its final review.
So you two met on Snitch.com.
No, of course not. We just need you to hold up the volley ball net.
You must be the Liberals I've heard so much about.
Well, despite that, we still consider ourselves open minded when it comes to Trump supporters.
I hear that you'll be leaving us soon.
Art isn't easy.
I'm just not ready to be tied down.
I hadn't realized you two had tied the knot.
Really, there is no pressure to contribute at these things.
I hear the bottom of the Hudson is beautiful this time of year.
It's called Amway. Have you heard of it?
Aren't you going to introduce me to your minus one?
Don't you think you're going a little overboard?
Last drink request?
You'll be interested in hearing about my grandson's essay.
Let me guess...you're journalists!
This piece is truly compelling - are you allowed to talk?
Did I tell you about my beautiful, creative, wonderful daughter who is climbing Everest to save the environment and ...
As a "look", I'm not impressed. As an excuse for being late, it just might work.
Great goodbye party!
And you must be the S & Ms.
Can I have a moment of your time?
Hey guys, great going away party.
I understand you can't stay long...
My dears, the theme for tonight's soirée was whodunit, not Houdini.
"You will remain there until each of you can say and spell "hors' d'oeuvres" correctly".
I've always felt one of my gifts is my ability to captivate my audience.
I respect abstinence, but can't you just say "No thank you"?
Thank you for agreeing to listen to a presentation about a fantastic time-share opportunity.
So tell me again, Senators, how are you going to vote on Trump's new health care plan?
Let's drown your sorrows first.
I'm just glad I was finally able to bring you two together.
We consider the concrete a pre-existing condition.
I feel like I was forced to attend this party too.
Maybe just try living together first?
Well I see you've met Doug...
This would have been easier had you RSVPed 'yes'.
So you're ready to take the plunge!
You must be from Jersey?
We call this "Two Bucket Chuck".
I was told to untie you only if you will stop talking about your dog.
I know you may think we are going a little overboard here.
Sorry, the Hoffa tribute was last night.
One for the Road
Drink like a... sleep with the... I can't remember how it goes, but whatever. Fishes.
Just sit tight, the tide's coming in.
Why? Because we can't have you urinating all over the floor - That's why."
I see your excuse of being all tied up tonight didn't get you off the hook.
Would I be too forward if I said I'm into this sort of thing, too?
I see that you ordered Cabernet with the fish.
"The Godfather's party is down the hall".
Is this your first wine hazing party?
You wanted him. You can have him.
We have ways of making you small-talk.
So, you're in concrete.
The invitation said, dress casually, not casualty.
How ever do you take selfies?
I hear you're about to take the plunge!
I'm so awkward at times like this. I know 'bon voyage' doesn't suit, but....
So, I see you two voted against the health care bill.
So how did you two meet?
Don't go away, I'll be right back.
This party is mobbed, eh?
I admire your restraint.
Before you start your free cruise, a quick question, can we can count on you guys to join our timeshare community today?
I admire a couple that does things together.
How long since you two tied the knot?
Thank you both for making this fundraiser a success!
I'll never understand conceptual art.
I see you've made Mr. Toscani's bucket list.
Keep it in the bedroom guys
Then you must meet the Flemingtons, they're also in witness protection.
Are those boots by Ivanka?
You two ready to take the plunge?
I'd give you a drink but it might make you tipsy.
I told Bugsy not to bring his work home.
So were you tied up in traffic?
Do you want one more for the river.
Could you smash those grapes a little faster? Big crowd tonight.
Look at it this way.You won't be going through a messy divorce.
Name your poison.
So, let's cement our relationship.
Sorry, it's the new corporate policy -- no witnesses.
It's hard to believe that book reviews are still taken seriously.
The safe word is 'Trump.'
Thanks for coming, you'd mentioned that you might be all tied up!
So when will the police be done gathering evidence?
This is a party you're bound to enjoy!
Unfortunately, there are some things you just can't unsee
Now say you're sorry you cheated on me.
I'd invite you to the after party, but I see you're tied up right now.
I've decided to unfriend you.
You still have a say. Hudson or East River?
I was an intern once.
New at EPA?
I'm sorry, but the CEO insisted that we needed to can two from our department
Mom, dad ... thanks for coming.
Are you ready for the most realistic murder mystery dinner ever?
We couldn't let you leave without a toast to your future together!
Betty in H. R. mentioned that you'd be leaving us.
Of course, I'd be happy to drop you off.
The invitation said 'black tie and tails,' not back-tied in pails.
Can I assume this is an involuntary transfer?
YOUR going away party, I assume?
I just love a captive audience!
As the new Faculty Senate Chair, need I remind you that elections have consequences?
Well technically this gallery IS under water.
Perhaps you shouldn't have called the Pollack 'a bunch of drizzle'.
You never know what'll you'll see at the Met Gala. I've never heard of your designer. Beelzebub, you said?
Are you guys on a bind date?
Soon you will fully understand the difference between "a drink" and "the drink".
In about 10 minutes we are all heading out to the pool
How do you guys know Big Joey?
At least you're honest about not wanting to be here...
Which airline did you say .................
We promise there'll be more in next year's budget for Witness Protection.
You're over-trussed.
Joey's never dealt well with criticism of his Mojitos
I told you, those co-op boards are simply murder
Do you get bathroom breaks, or is that what the bucket is for?
We'll miss the life you bring to a party.
I see you're both wearing Carlo Gambino.
So how do you know Mr. Capone?
How often do you need to be watered?
...and so I said repurpose THIS, you little bastard.. well, anyway, then...
You look like you could use the drink.
I knew you two would have a lot in common.
So what else is on your bucket list?
Coming or going?
Now, where were we before you tried to leave?
I'm so glad I convinced you to come.
You're late-- I was beginning to worry.
So where do you two live--you'll pardon the expression.
The 13th step
I just heard; the company's taking us on a river cruise tonight
Designated drivers I presume?
I see the two of you have bonded!
I hate it when my boss forces me to go to these mixers. What about you two?
I'm guessing you guys brought the moscato with a screw cap.
Quit whining. Everyone makes sacrifices.
This isn't one of 'those' kind of parties...
Thank you for the generous increase in your pledge.
But enough about me—tell me about yourselves.
The last stage of introvert immersion therapy is always the hardest.
This certainly is one way to quit drinking.
You're not dancing?
Well I get it...but nobody else will!
Please, feel free to mingle.
That's the best reason for not drinking I've ever heard.
Make me an offer I can't refuse.
How else did you think the grapes got crushed?
On a lighter note, the Italians are also responsible for this wonderful Barolo.
I gather birth control pills aren't on your insurance plan.
"Sally, did you do something new with your hair?!
I'm always uncomfortable at these parties, too.
Oh you'll love Sag Harbor!
Remember, you’re representing the existential plight of our upper-middle class. Without being too obvious about it!
Well, at least you're not really missing much. Can you believe they're serving a Chilean merlot?
Welcome to United Airlines.
It's my party and I'll tie if I want to.
Make America Great again", that's all you said?
Now, about that pledge contribution . . .
This is our pre-flight training required for all airline passengers now.
I just love a captive audience!
Again, Thank you for investing with us, did you have any other questions?
I know it seems harsh but your grape stomping has produced a below average Pinot
Last chance. What's the vintage?
I feel like you guys don't want to be here.
You know, divorce no longer has the stigma it once did....
I would like to see you two mingle a little more...
Are you life imitating art?
I assume you got roped into this.
I'm having a terrific time at your Going Away party!
In five minutes, only the wine will be breathing.
And there's one more surprise coming!
Did you guys just get bumped from your flight!
Have a drink, it'll loosen you up.
Speaking of micro-apartments, how do you find living in a pot?
So, do you think Witness Protection would have been a better choice?
I heard the abyss is lovely this time of year.
Okay -do you promise in future not to hold the glass by the stem, swirl the wine and comment on the bouquet?
So where do you two live--if you'll pardon the expression?
So, it's a metaphor for your emotional unavailability?
So avant-garde.
You've really nailed this year's Met Gala theme.
And don't go whining to H.R.
So , you're scientists?
Tieing one on seems oddly appropriate.
I don't care for the concept but the execution is breathtaking.
You're right. Sometimes you just need to get out of your comfort zone.
The one that correctly identified the raspberry notes on the finish will survive
Then it is true when they say "There's someone for everyone."
Well look what the tide dragged in.
What a wonderful party! Thank you for hostaging.
So glad you could fit us in before your other commitment.
And....you will be forced to drink this very inferior Merlot.
I see you met the other side of the family.
So, Tony tells me you two plan to swim with the fishes! I just love to snorkel myself...
Let's drown your sorrows first and then take it from there.
Thanks, but I'm not into threesomes.
You swallowed during the tasting, didn't you.
...and that's where I got the idea for my new lecture series 'How to Maintain a Captive Audience'.
I thought you two kids should meet while you still had time.
You must be the ones with pre-existing conditions.
I hope we haven't inconvenienced you.
Welcome to the party! Looks like somebody has already taken care of you.
Even so, it was brave of you to leak Trump's tax returns.
We have reached a consensus. It's white wine when you eat fish and red wine when fish eat you.
So, how do you two know Vinnie?
You two really take Charades seriously.
Concrete or cement?
Are you Art?
You're the parents, I assume?
May I offer you a cyanide?
The exhibits at the MoMA really are life-like.
How about one for the drink?
Fortunately, you only have to sleep with the Fishers.
Your soaking in it.
Hey, that's great. We're having fish for dinner tonight too.
Yeah, I've heard the witness protection program isn't all it's cracked up to be.
I did the Ice Bucket Challenge but this is going too far
Tell me, which of the 12 steps is this one?
I'm having so much fun I could just stand here and talk with you guys forever....
Stop me if you'very heard this before, but...
You could have just called and told me you had another engagement.
"Your lives sound fascinating! The worst thing I've ever done is to not tip my waiter".
It's a classic Merlot, but the aroma has notes of chocolate, strawberry and East River.
Sorry, we're a bit tied up at the moment.
Oh! We have a partial view of the river and it's just lovely.
One straw or two?
Charles and Suzanne! I knew you were bound to come.
So, where do you go from here?
The bonds of marriage are not on my bucket list
This art piece looks too realistic, or am I drunk?
The poison or marriage, your choice.
I learned a long time ago not to take a captive audience for granted.
Just be careful around the pool.
So, what do performance artists do exactly?
You gave yourselves away when he said "bigly."
Which do you want to hear about, my wine tasting class, CrossFit, or my newfound vegan lifestyle?
They don't call my hubby Tommy "Two Buckets" Balboni for nothing.
Our initiation rites predate the Revolutionary War.
I think small talk requires a captive audience; don't you?
You display such restraint. Impressive in this market.
Typical male! Has to have a bigger bigger bucket!
I still think it's rude to arrive so late.
... except you have to do it backwards, in high heels, in a bucket, and with two lengths of rope tying your legs together.
The upside of dealing with Italians is there wine.
...and that is how I think he will make America great again.
It's always a pleasure to meet my husband's business associates.
How was that move to New Jersey?
Welcome to the 2018 White House Correspondents Dinner. You must be with CBS?
A few good sips might loosen you up, but I can tell you're already potted.
Well, technically this is a concrete solution for the school board.
I see you've met my Uncle Vito.
You just can't laugh during a Jeff Sessions misrepresentation.
Never mind that; you're here now. What can I get you?
Luigi says you'll be sleeping with the fishes. I swam with the dolphins once.
I like being tied up, too, but what's with the buckets?
Do you know the Jenkins'? They're in the East River.
I ordered perennials. Not Millennials.
These parties are impossible to leave.
Sure I can't drop you off somewhere?
I knew you were bound to show up.
From now on every time I pass a potted plant I will imagine hearing sobs of loneliness and unfulfilled potential.
Finally, somebody who's willing to talk!
Would you like two straws?
There's a special hell for vinophobics like you.
Are you two together?
I think The Sopranos was totally unrealistic, don't you?
So, what part of 'Spoilers get stitches and end up in ditches' did you not understand?
Darlings, the committee loved your first installation. We see almost no problem with continuing your funding.
I thought you weren't coming because you were tied up.
"Oh my dears! Where did you get that fabulous rope?!
Can I get your keys? You're blocking me in.
Isn't it exciting? You have been selected to participate in the President's new cost saving health care plan!
On the bright side-- you are not Sean Spicer.
When she said attendance was mandatory I assumed she was joking.
I hope you're not too drunk to dive.
Are you represented?
It's too bad the lethal drugs expired.
You could've just told me you were too tied up to come.
As I was saying, before you rudely interrupted me...
Here's a fun game. Do you think this glass is half full or half empty"
So glad you could come. By the way, you'll be our entertainment later.
I notice you're not really mingling.
Leaving so soon?
I heard the after party will be a splash.
Oh, good, it looks like you were able to clear room in your busy schedules after all.
Anyway, I won't keep you much longer
Are you just for display or could I buy you?
Finally taking the plunge?
You're lucky. Some people wait years for a transplant.
These ice-breakers are just torture aren't they?
Aren't you irked that he's less tied than you?
I was so looking forward to seeing you at my soiree next Friday... are you sure you won't be able to attend?
I don't understand why you people don't just do something to help yourself.
No, you don't need to call the Police. We are a sculpture by Rhue Von Ballinger and part of today's gallery exhibit.
I have some ideas on how your heirs can avoid probate.
This Zinfandel goes well with the fishes
So glad you came! Did you have any trouble getting here?
Actually, to be honest, when you said you were going to be late because you were tied up I thought you were just making excuses.
To remove concrete, soak the shoes in cold water with salt and vinegar. Why do you ask?
Any further comments about our cabernet's lack of "legs?"
Did you have any trouble finding the place?
We think of junior board members like potted plants
I have to say that was an unusual wedding ceremony.
Have this drink. You look a little pale.
You must be the Houdinis.
I'd untie you, but we promised to leave the space exactly as we found it.
It's the standard punishment for people who use the words 'bucket list'.
Bon Voyage
Would you like two straws?
Well, this conversation has been simply captivating.
Can I get you anything while Joey's bringing the car around?
How restrictive is the new diet?
Yes, of course I know Fat Tony, but what did he mean by 'a fate worse than death'?
First, let me tell you all about my day.
I'm sure you share my concern about rising ocean levels.
Not to worry, most couples feel like this the night before the wedding.
Well, if you hadn't whined about the wine...
So I heard you guys are going to be in Lake Tahoe.
'So, you must be the two they roped in to do the grape crush this year.'
And me? Oh, I'm just moving to Canada.
I'll drink this myself, since you're already potted.
Good news. We've arranged for express drop-off.
I do SO love a captive audience.
My wife roped me into this.
I admire that you're both bound and determined to stand your ground.
Cheers!
All finished, have fun at prom!
I thought you meant you were tied up in traffic.
Performance art or low tip for the valet?
You really should try to mingle.
Speaking of vacations, you two going to the lake this summer?
I promise. Next time we'll RSVP.
It looks like things are getting serious between you two.
I have to ask because it's bothering me.... Were you here last week?
Critics of my art often fail the buoyancy challenge.
It's a wine tasting, I'm supposed to spit into the bucket...
I believe in staying positive.
What a lovely going-away party!
You don't know what "bucket-list" means, do you?
At least you won't need health insurance.
And how'd you two meet?
I'll be your somolinetrex this evening.
I would offer you this drink, but I see your hands are tied.
You're carrying your AA pledges a bit far.
Next time you should bring a better bottle of wine.
I love talking to a captive audience!
I simply had to have you two on my bucket list.
Rumor has it that you're both ready to take the plunge.
Yes, you can upgrade to an Orrefors bucket filled with hand-selected Amazon river stone.
Unfortunately, we don't have any straws.
My husband said to give you two shots and a splash.
At least the higher-ups kept you two on as office plants.
Think of it as exploring the tension between the abstract and the concrete.
I've heard that Lake Michigan is lovely this time of year.
I warned you it was an aggressive little wine.
Would you like a straw?
The host found out you were Republicans?
Till depth do you part .
Before you go, would you like a sip of a fair but firm pinot noir?
I hope you know its wine and dine. Not wine and twine.
I call this piece "Nasty critics at my gallery opening.". Now, I'll call you an Uber."
I see you're already potted.
Harvey and I are still working on our bucket list.
Yeah, work's been dragging me down lately, too.
If you don't want to donate to the foundation, just say so.
I don't think so. I would have remembered.
It looks like you are having a rough evening. May I get you a drink?
Two shots and a splash?
It's inspiring to see you suffer for your art.
So what're you guys doing later?
Can I get you a Beer Helmet?
Yeah, my IRA has some pretty stiff penalties for early withdrawals, too.
One last chance: It's merlot or the East River.
Don't Brad and Kate just throw the best immersion therapy parties?
I suppose we'll be holding your exit interviews right here.
And next I have for you an au verre you can't refuse.
You won't have a problem with this job. The pool is only 3 feet deep.
I once hit rock bottom too.
I respect your courage in supporting a third party candidate
I'd offer you a glass of wine but it appears we're ready to load you onto the truck.
Last time you criticize the president, Mr. Will.
This is one heckuva going away party.
I'm so glad we could take the weight off your shoulders.
I'm also trying to quit drinking. I just have no self control.
Only if you stop telling us why you voted for Hillary.
I can't tell you that. You obviously can't keep a secret.
Having a captive audience has vastly improved my cocktail party experience.
We're clearing out the swamp to make room for the cesspool.
But enough about me. How do you know the Sopranos?
Best going away party ever.
Cheers, Emma and Colin. Mr. Mankoff said it'll take some getting used to, but you'll figure it out soon enough. Probably.
Now that I have your undivided attention.
Congratulations! You two have won the draw for a surprise visit to the East River.
Now that I have your attention, the reasons that I voted for Donald Trump are . . .
Those shoes are to die for.
So who do you know in the mob?
You don't have to worry until the guy with a bag of cement shows up. Until then, enjoy.
I warned you this cocktail party would be torture!
I know just what you mean: I often feel trapped at parties, too.
I’ve held you both hostage long enough. You should mingle.
It's a slight variation of the blind taste test.
We've run out of straws.
And you will stay here until you can taste the difference between a Zinfandel and a Pinot.
You're being very good sports.
So, how did you meet?
I don't want to be here either.
I prefer a captive audience
You must be the Irish-Italian dance instructors.
Ah, President Trump's cabinet has arrived.
Here's to cementing our friendship.
Consider yourselves lucky: you should see the line for the toilet.
What part of mandatory don't you understand?
You're an interesting couple.
Which would you prefer for drowning -- tap or bottled?
This party's a hit.
Art? Or fish bait?
Well, you two certainly embraced that "for better or for worse" thing.
Can I get you something to unwind?
Congratulations, but I have a different idea of a bucket list.
You know toenail fungus doesn't have the stigma it once had.
Already potted, huh?
Ordinarily, one wouldn't wear cement at this time of year.
Structured settlement?
You must be the two that ordered the red wine with fish...
I'm glad you made it to the party even though you guys said you were all tied up.
You know, those shoes really do make the outfit.
Yes, you are the only Trump supporters here.
We bring out the best for our farewell parties...
You are taking this bucket list a little too far.
Welcome to The Harry Houdini Temperance League ... we follow a one-step program here.
For Here or to Go?
I'm feeling ... early American witchcraft ... cum colonial/corporate greed ... cum post modern existential malaise.
I'd offer you two a drink but it looks like you're already potted.
I understand Vito's grades will be improving this term.
And the only difference is that the woman's pail is shorter?
You must be the couple that didn't RSVP.
I'm sure it was an innocent bookkeeping error.
Wow this really is social torture!
I don't care what you say. Your pre-existing condition is not my problem.
I feel so badly for you. Say... Do you guys still have that rent control apt. in Manhattan?
I admire your self-restraints.
So Canada said no to your immigration application?
Only fools praise French wine at a Mafia wine tasting.
I call it "First 100 Days."
Enough about me. Have I told you about my cat?
I had this dream last night. I was wearing brown slacks - or were they tan? - no, brown - hold on, maybe they were bluuuue...
What was it exactly that you said to the Don?
Your health plan has significant restrictions, but does include a free glass of wine.
R&D always suspected you were plants.
Did you forget each other's safe word?
While they felt flattered to be the honored guests at the mob's second annual "Swimming with the Fishes Gala," the Fazios still found it hard to really relax and enjoy it.
It's such a pity that your applications to the witness protection program were delayed.
Let me tell you about MY day.
You must be the designated divers.
Which part of the 12 step program is this?
Is this performance art or couple therapy?
Stomp a little longer, I'm not quite getting the tang I was hoping for.
So how do you like being teachers?
We find that cocktails make the exit interviews much more pleasant
Welcome to our Badaboom's yacht party. The main course is seafood... if you get ny drift.
Who knew this party would be a hit?
Don't worry, you'll grow out of it.
Next time bring better wine.
I just don't get contemporary art.
I would offer you a drink, but I see you are tied up at the moment.
It was the only way we could guarantee your party remained a surprise.
I'm sorry you won't be able to join us for dinner later.
My therapist says I'm stuck, too.
But enough about me-- go mingle!
Now that I've got you, let me tell you all about my cat's intestinal problems.
Are you the deplorables?
Have you ever heard of single premium life? Because I think that really could be the ticket for you.
Compliments of the couple on the wall.
Oh, my! Vera, come see this contemporary repartee on American Gothic…
Sorry to see you go...
Actually, the Club’s initiation process is just a notch above hazing.
Oh, that silly Tony. He's gone and mixed up the Guest List and the Death List again!
Your last chance! Will you like me on Facebook?
In Chicago, some things never change.
You ditched me at the last party, didn't you?
Have you ever just considered moving to Canada?
Well, you had to be Democrats.
You must be the last 2 of the Obama administration
Hazing is an important part of our corporate culture.
Let's toast to your new life together. I'm a divorce attorney if you need me.
You must be Democrats.
You look like you're dying for something wet.
You shouldn't have told us you voted for him.
We didn't really want to come to this party, but our hands were tied.
We do try to add a cordial sophistication to our executions.
It's probably a good idea to keep your political views to yourselves, these days.
Here, this will help you get through it.
I don't know anyone else at this party. I hope you don't mind.
Three-Finger Tommy throws the best parties, doesn't he?
Would you like a drink, or are you already potted?
Were you able to infiltrate the Trump rally?
Yes, that's quick-set cement. Why do you ask?
Well, it sure looks like an effective alternative to AA.
You had your chance to accept a voucher on a future cruise. Now we need your cabin for our employees.
I'm reading a book called "The Secret," about positive thinking and the law of attraction.
All couples dress alike.
Rich, fruity, with just a hint of punishment.
My husband I separated last week, but enough about me, how did you two meet?
"Please mingle...I don't want to tie you up all evening".
Have you seen the pool? It'll take your breath away.
That's not quite how we do the ice bucket challenge.
Hi I'm Mable , I'm a dystopian.
This is the best going away party I've ever been to.
What a coincidence! My husband and I are in concrete, as well.
I think you can be the kind of couple that stays deeply committed.
Now do I have your full attention?
Don't ya just hate going away parties?
And it's rich in antioxidants for long life.
I so enjoy having a captive audience.
Now that I have your attention...
So how did you two get roped into coming to this party?
So what happened after you told your boss you hate networking events?
So, when are you two going to take the plunge and finally tie the knot?
We take double dipping very seriously.
No invitation?
It's nothing personal - we're just draining the swamp of Democrats.
It's a softer red. It goes well with fish.
What flight were you on?
Talk, or the Pinot goes in the bucket....
Oh well you know, these company mixers are always a little awkward.
I'll never understand modern art.
Wait, you just flew back on WHICH airline?
Did I hear you're going away?
So, you intend to join a restricted club?
The East River is marvelous this time of year
I wish I could lay off the drinks and hors d'oeuvres like you guys.
Well if it keeps you from overeating, good for you.
So... what brings you to Mar-A-Lago?
Try the Chardonnay--it goes better with fish.
Did you really think you could have gotten away with bringing that boxed stuff AND Velveeta?!
The Pinot Gris goes well with fish.
Oh come on, give me a hug.
Goodness, and I thought I needed a cocktail this evening.
It looks mildly intriguing, but I'm over my 50 Shades of Grey phase.
I understand you two are on loan from the mob.
Thanks for coming. I'll have Guido drop you off on his way home.
So, what brings you here?
We refused to drink the Kool-Aid.
I hear you've cemented your relationship
Finally, someone who will listen to my vacation highlights!
Can I drop you off somewhere?
Have you reconsidered our time share offer?
If you're tied up, I can get the next round.
We felt a going away party was appropriate.
I would ask if the boss drug you here kicking and screaming, but it looks more like you just dropped in...
You knew there would be consequences for serving red wine with fish.
I'm going to have to stop you here. I'm not comfortable where this conversation is going.
But enough about me, what's new in your lives?
No pressure Emma and Colin.... still a few days till deadline.
You'll be fine -- just don't swallow!
So, I hear you've joined that new East River fitness club.
Which wine do you like with fish?
Welcome to the mafia mixer for new snitches
You two have made my bucket list.
Love the shoes!
Happy to help; white or red?
Well, everyone else knew to bring a hostess gift.
And I thought I was potted.
No, you won't go in the river. I'll just bore you to death.
This one should pair nicely with the fishes.
Who knew the ice-bucket challenge would go this far?
Is this the last item on your bucket list?
Was this on your bucket list?
I recall I was held hostage once...
This wine is to die for.
I can't let you drink without a designated diver.
If the first twelve steps fail, we guarantee the thirteenth will work.
We don't add the concrete until you're done squashing the grapes.
I'm guessing this wasn't on your bucket list.
So why were you two running late?
So I'm guessing you didn't got the memo on disagreeing with the new administration's policies?
That's the only way I would be able to stop drinking.
Well that explains the dead fish! I thought it was just a bad caterer.
Let's just say you're toast!
It's an off-vintage for Bordeaux. Trust me, you'd hate it.
Does this mean you two are back together again?
Our administration's hazing is a friendlier form of waterboarding.
Well hello, I'd heard you two weren't free tonight.
Charles tells me you swim with fishes.
This campus welcomes conservative speakers.
I know, dears. But what would you do with un-tenured faculty?
My husband will drop you off.
This is best, because you won't have to appear at any congressional hearing.
Your first Live Art exhibit?
This wine pairs well with fish...
At last, someone who will listen!
I see that you are only on step 3.
Those shoes are to die for.
I hear you two are ready to take the plunge.
Welcome to the Soprano's cast party. Vinny will give you a ride home.
I see you have another party to go to.
So how do you two know Guido?
You'll have to excuse Peter, he just finished a Sopranos marathon.
You two should make quite a splash at the after-party.
So, that's my summer travel plans. How about you?
It is supposed to breathe for a few minutes...
May I tell you more about this time-share opportunity?
Congratulations on tying the knot.
So you're both having a drink with Big Vinny afterward the party?
Being tied up at an art opening has always been on our bucket list.
I'm glad to see you're exercising some restraint at our party.
With your pre-existing conditions, you will enjoy this affordable treatment with Trumpcare.
Let me show you our new private dock.
Personally, I'd legalize pot.
I just know you'll love the dip "I can't wait for you to try the dip.
You guys met on Mafia.Com, right?
Week 1 at the center for cellphone rehab
So, how long have you known Luca?
Look, you two, you promised me you'd try to mingle more this time.
I hear you've gone dormant until the next administration.
Anti-potted plants is it? Well I'm supporting grape workers- you want to bet who helps their cause more tonight.
As soon as the cement hardens you will embark on your complementary cruise. Meanwhile, enjoy the festive atmosphere.
This is wrong. You shouldn't be horribly punished like this just for voting for Trump. Hm. On second thought, yes you should. Bon Voyage!
So whose bucket list are you on?
Sorry but we have spoken to you before about bringing oaky chardonnay.
Marvelous use of negative space.
So, any concrete plans for the weekend?
Really? You used the same excuse for being late to you niece's bat mitzvah.
I find these wine and cheese events torturous as well.
Even though you got roped into this, it will cement your relationship.
I agree. People forget you so much faster when there's no tombstone.
Tough audit?
Maybe next time you'll return the RSVP card.
Ever since Trump, the East River has become so unfashionable. You'll love the Hudson.
Been there. Done that.
Feel free to leave.
Sorry. This is a no smoking cruise.
What a wonderful opportunity for me to tell you about my recent surgery.
Can I call you an Uber?
That may keep you from drinking, but what about the Twelve Steps?
I suppose you think I drink like the fishes.
So what part of the Hamptons are they dumping you at?
Is the elevator working again? Or did you hop up?
I see you two were bound to attend this opening.
Are you staying for the boat ride?
I understand you're the folks who won the double dare contest.
It was so kind of you to stop my on your way to getting whacked!
So how much did he pay you for that forged Picasso?
Really, couples shock therapy?
Fortunately we got out of journalism before the change in administrations.
I guess you two'll be sticking around for awhile?
And United lost your luggage, too?
So tell me, which of my pieces did you like best?
Rocco said something about showing you guys our riverfront area.
Realism has gotten so... real.
Who gets the hemlock mojito?
I wouldn't have come to this party if I'd known it was going to be such a mob scene.
I just want to thank you for volunteering tonight to be the designated drivers .
We chill the people, not the wine.
"For what it's worth, I love your shoes"!
And the one who most accurately identifies the varietal will not go into the river.
My condolences on the loss of all your hopes and dreams.
I see that your friendship has been cemented!
You guys must be the death of the party.
That sounds fascinating - is it anything like swimming with dolphins?
So how do you know the Fishes?
As you've gathered, the club's initiation process is quite strict.
And that's why we are so late.
How you are getting out of here?
First one to cross the finish line gets the job.
Aren't those shoes killing you?
Vinnie tells me you are about to take a long trip out to sea...
The pool is out back.
Just think of this as a concrete token of our esteem.
How are you finding this year's parent-teacher conference?
My bucket list, my rules.
I know this is no fun, but great art is never easy...
Isn't Lent over?
If you really wanted to make a statement, you should be wearing blindfolds. Just sayin'.
Oh, dear. Have I been talking too much?
Could I have your drink tickets?
I hope I didn't strongarm you too much.
I don't think that is how the ice bucket challenge works!
...and two years ago I had this outbreak of hives...
But on a first date?
Welcome to Day Two of aversion therapy.
It was wonderful talking to you. Have a great day.
Boy, you two look like you need to loosen up and unwind.
... and our youngest, Mary, was just named student of the month, and ...
And that's why I struggle with contemporary art.
I'd throw this wine in your face for effect but it's a 1945 Chateau Mouton-Rothschild
Did you get a chance to try the shrimp?
You must be the new donors
So, you worked for the previous administration?
Must be your first time at Club Masochist?
Don't worry. The mob only does that to people in cartoons.
Well I see you have decided to tie the knot!
I'm sorry you voted for Trump, but now its payback time.
You crushed these grapes yourself?!
Say, "Please".
The diet is working, both of you look great!
Try the chardonnay...it goes well with fish.
It's called the mafia diet and it really works!
So then I told my shrink that most people won't let me speak to them for long.
I guess "toast" has taken on a different meaning.
It's called the icebreaker challenge.
Bucket list?
Friends don't let friends drive drunk.
Next time wash your feet before you crush the grapes!
Let me tell you about my first colonoscopy prep.......
I'm going to suggest we skip the next networking exercise on "working the room".
Until you can identify the Malbec, you'll remain here.
I'll untie you if you admit ice and red wine are non-sympatico.
You performance artists are so captivating.
Wait a second, yes I do! Last year's office party at Comet Ping Pong!
I'm glad I'm not in your shoes
I see you're in the one-step program.
So, you mean AA has a 13th step?
Oh my goodness, this installation is the most lifelike one in the show.
I give up. Does it sound like Nantucket?
This is not the way to cement your relationship.
I didn't know it was so hard to be the designated driver.
I see you tied the knot before you kicked the bucket .
Ah. You must be Tony's new accounting team. How's it going?
The pleasure was mine.
Listen to me! I haven't talked this much in years. Must be the wine!
Some wine before we board the boat?
Perhaps you didn't get my messages: I said I'd like to add you to my professional network on LinkedIn.
Considering this is your first affair, you're showing great restraint!
No, this is the Rosen bar mitzvah.
I'm in acquisitions. So, what did you do?
Now that I have your undivided attention.
I see you're wearing Tony Soprano
What did you put on your bucket list?
Would you like a drink before we throw you overboard?
The stakes at these fundraisers just keep getting higher, don’t they?
Christ, what an asshole.
So, how was your trip?
No, this is terminal one. Delta Airlines is terminal two.
I know that dock area isn’t safe—but don’t you love the rent?
And you're captives of the bride or the groom?
It's a young red, but who has the time nowadays to let it age.
Could you two crush the grapes a bit faster? My glass is running dangerously low.
You'll learn to love our strong HOA.
For better for worse
I must confess. It was not totally your fault.
Stay as long as you like!
On second thought, I don't think you will be needing this.
Me too, I feel like I am drowning every day!
Toast?
Here's mud in your eyes.
So, your health insurance doesn't consider this to be a pre-existing condition?
This is a classy wine so keep your feet in the bucket till you get home.
Let me guess: Step #13?
So, tell me about your new diet.
Our kids called it the new ice bucket challenge.
So do you kids have any plans for the weekend?
Wouldn't Antabuse be simpler?
I'll ask you again: do you believe in anthropomorphic global warming
Just because you two just got promoted doesn't change the Fact that I still pick the winning caption. CLEAR?
No, I insist, don't lift a finger.
I think you'll find the Sauvignon Blanc is refreshingly crisp.
Oh, I'm so sorry the club rejected your membership, but you know it only takes one negative vote and we dump you.
I understand you each have a pre- existing condition?
This must be the last number on your bucket list.
I'm feeling a little potted myself.
. . . So that's what's wrong with my life.
You must be the folks with the art bidding addiction.
The ice bucket challenge never appealed to me.
What are you doing after the party?
any regrets with your voting choices??
A cure for restless leg syndrome, smoking and drinking? How's it working for you?
Just a small gathering to welcome you to the co-op, the board seemed very impressed.
Can I get you anything.?
Please, you'll have to forgive the restraints. But there's a rumor circulating that you're both Middle Class homeowners with student loan debt?
Pairs well, but a rough finish.
The first party as a vegan is the hardest!
Well yes, but at least our plan has no death squads...
Who wants to get wineboarded first?
Me? I just set mine to airplane mode and try not to think about it.
So, AA didn't work for you?
Oh, don't be so selfish. A lot of people would die to be thrown into the Hudson right now.
So your boss made you come to this party?
Congratulations on your sobriety.
You're right. This wine is to die for.
Pardon me, but are you really art?
So I see you have voiced your opinion at liberal party?
I know the feeling -- when Schwarzenegger won in 2003, I had to dye my hair green.
It's a treatment modality for what?
You're not leaving are you?
Is this interactive art?!
On behalf of Make-A-Wish, I welcome you.
So you are the pair who hacked Wine Spectator!
How's your immersion therapy going?
Welcome to Snitch Hell. Glass of box wine?
It's called The Titanic Ultimate Escape Room... Fantastic experience!
That still sounds like more fun than the Circle Line.
I feel the same way at these things.
Welcome to your first Parent Volunteer Committee meeting.
Honestly, I didn't think you would accept my invitation.
These conferences are just torture, don't you think?
No! I said you if you get tied up, I'll pick up the ICE bucket stand
Is this your first visit to the East River?
I think you two just need to get away.
Keep stomping, Bob needs a refill.
And then she said...I'm not boring you am I?
Are you sure the party doesn't want you running again Hillary and Tim?
You will find our wine tasting is a bit different than most ...
You will taste this wine and you will give it 92 points.
I thought this happened only in the movies.
You are NOT stick in the muds!
Anyways, how are the kids?
I'll bet this wasn't on your bucket list.
We've decided to live metaphorically.
The sommalier's decisions are final.
So we're on your bucket list?
Say Hi to Vito for me.
What exactly do bed bugs in the lobby couches have to do with me, Brad?
Still, it's good of him to throw a Bon Voyage party.
It's not that you wouldn't be a marvelous addition to my collection, it's just I have no idea where I'd put you.
Now that I have you here, I'd like to talk to you about a major donation to the museum.
A nice sicilian red to mark the occasion?
It's better than being tongue-tied.
Who ordered the float?
Your on someone's bucket list
This will set you free.
First rule of living in the Big Apple: don't snitch on the mafia. Second rule… ditto.
What happened to your hair?
At "Going Out in Style", we use only the finest artisinal concrete curing techniques and antique buckets that best match your accessories.
Rumor has it you weren't very cooperative.
What are you doing after the party?
Did you know that climate change can cause a rise in sea level?
So you'll be joining us on the evening cruise?
Is 'Don't just stand there. We've been mugged!' part of the artist's conceptualism?
I hear you two will be swimming with the fishes. How exotic!
Sorry, but the others did not appreciate your bringing 2Buck Chuck to the vintage of the century tasting.
In hindsight, the VIP package was a good value for money.
When I invited you, you said you were all tied up tonight and lo and behold, here you are!
I guess you'll be going into the high-risk pool?
I can't speak to the artistic merit, but you're much more interesting to talk to than the other installations.
And when we're done with drinks we'll pour the cement and drop you in the pool.
So which one of you will be handling the Best Picture envelope this year?
In my day it was a scarlet letter.
You must be doing the new ICE bucket protest.
Tell me again what it was that you said to the winemaker about his wine?
Let me be the last to say bon voyage!
A major network is interested.
Congratulations, I hear you're now part of the Permanent Collection.
Just a few more of these and you won't feel a thing...
You must be the Untitleds...
So this party was on your bucket list?
"Sleeping with the fishes" actually sounds very relaxing.
I've also memorized Part One of Atlas Shrugged--I'm sure you'd like to hear that too.
I can offer you a glass of wine to make up for any inconvenience we may have caused.
I find this Beaujolais pairs well with sea water
Welcome to United Airlines pre-boarding compliance and cavity search happy-hour, I see you may be flying standby with us today!
I guess it was a rough flight.
I confess I've felt out of place from time to time. How about you?
Heard you've been tied up and in some hot water, but I'm still glad you could be here.
We took a vote and it was this or Cards Against Humanity.
Stay right there. I've got someone you just have to meet.
They gave you an offer; You refused!
I've been authorized to quadruple our offer to buy your life insurance policies.
Now, about that raise
So, what did Mr. Coppola think of your review of his wine?
Socially awkward.
We haven't met. You must be the Houdinis.
Where are my manners? Would like to smell the Shiraz?
...and that's when I realized it would make a great app.
Never crash a Mafia party!
So that's my bucket list. How about you?
Ready to reconsider your criticism of Trump?
Oh and have you seen our new swimming pool?
we said no red wine in the beige room.
Would you like a drink?
What did you think Roger meant when he put you on our bucket list?
I find this conversation so captivating
Any last words before you complete your bucket list?
Let me guess - you're both escapologists.
Thank you for listening to all the stories about my pets. Can you believe my family actually thinks they're boring?
It's my party and I'll tie if I want to.
And how was the #TheCementGala this year?
Be patient. The Lone Ranger is on his way.
You really need to circulate more.
So what is it that got you to tie the knot?
So, how are you two enjoying the Dada pool party?
Good job in crushing the grapes.
It's wonderful to see that you have bonded so nicely.
You must be the parents of the bride.
"Well, look at it this way you still have freedom of speech. Wine?''
Are you both dirty rats?
How long have you two lived in Brooklyn?
Where were we? Oh yes, let me tell you about my daughter's gap year...
I understand you folks are going swimming later.
Peter and Laurie had no idea what lay in store for them at the "How To Be A Better Listener: The Immersive Theatre Cocktail Party Experience."
Do you need a straw?
My apologies for roping you into this conversation.
Next time, maybe you'll think before you serve a Malbec with halibut.
So how do you like the neighborhood?
you poor things, don't know what you did but can I get you a merlot, chardonnay or sparking water?
Tonight you sleep with the fish-inspired bouillabaisse with Pernod infusion.
I see you're bound and determined...
This is the last time you Californians will bring Pinot Noir to a New York cocktail party.
Let me show you the ropes
The wine steward insists you give it another try.
To you and the fishes in the deep blue sea
Peter couldn't make it. He's tied up at work.
Of course we welcome diverse opinions.
Your health insurance policy's approach to couple therapy is innovative, to say the least.
Who or what you sleep with is your own business.
And then I said, "Cathy, you can't make people listen to your problems!"
Welcome to texters anonymous.
If there is ever anything that I can do, just call.
Can I Uber you to the pier?
Would you care for some water boarding?
That's quite a bucket list.
And what brought you two together?
You're gonna love your timeshare.
Granted, it’s an awkward initiation. But we find most new guests simply muddle through.
Crash a Mensa party you hit the bucket list
And then afterwards they mount your footprints at Grauman's Chinese.
So, is this your last time here?
I understand you've just returned from North Korea. How was it?
Well, if it isn't Harriet Houdini and her long-suffering sidekick.
Only distantly related to Harry Houdini, you say ... how fascinating.
Welcome to the Get Roughed Up and Dropped in a River Experience. Enjoy the cocktail reception while the rest of the guests arrive. Spoiler alert, though, it's just gonna be more fuckin' white people, because of COURSE it is
Tell me, was this going-away party really a surprise?
How was Sicily?
Chardonnay? Oh wait, I see you are designated divers....
I know you both feel your hands are tied, but let's put an offer on this house before you get cold feet.
French or Italian?
The 18th century is so in right now.
Um, yeah. Definitely not on my bucket list.
Finally, both sip a portion of this love potion.
Before I down a couple I always down a couple.
Congratulations! I see you're ready to take the plunge.
Here's a toast to a long and stable marriage.
I see they ran out of trellises.
You've been sent to network with the fishes, I see.
Bon Voyage
This is the fun part, the cement dries and we all say, "bada bing bada boom" and throw you into the harbor.
I like your hair; nice tousled effect.
Live long and prosper.
I'm so glad you both decided to come hear about how schools of choice are going to save our public education system.
I'm in real estate and I see you're in cement.
C'mon, don't you think it's funny that this wine also needs more time to breathe?
It's a silly game called Sleep with the Fishes, but our little guy takes it very seriously.
Don't tell anyone, but I don't really love this wine either.
I'm afraid my husband takes double-dipping really seriously
I told you my brother was a deadweight
Don't you just hate being roped into these things.
Will you be staying for dinner?
How romantic--you two met while 'swimming with the fishes'?
I’ve heard of ‘open’ relationships… How does an ‘inhibited’ relationship work?
My doctor said I needed to stop drinking wine. Naturally I switched doctors.
Cheers! Pigeage and bondage are both on your bucket list?
You'll understand if I don't offer you hors d'oeuvres.
Roped into hosting book club again, I see.
Ok, so what IS the wine pairing for concrete?
It's "The Donald". I warned you to never call him "The Don".
You must be the ones who voted for Trump
Okay, so they pulled you out of the river...then what happened?
I will free you but I can't protect you if you keep irritating the Hillary crowd.
Oh, c'mon...one sip won't kill you.
Just pretend like you want to be here
Before we drop you: a toast from the whistle blower ethics hotline group
A toast to cement your new relationship!
I warned you not to talk politics.
I see that you are at the thirteenth step.
I see someone else has experience with contractors not finishing the job.
Really? A come as you are party? I feel so silly, now!
I'm so tired of vapid chatter with self-absorbed, over-inflated egos at these parties.
I warned you it would be torture.
Oh, I hope I'm not boring you..
So...what do you do?
Just had to "Like" the Andrew Wyeth, didn't you.
So Jeffery starts boarding school in the fall then?
I always knew accounting was lucrative, but being able to retire so young!
Luckily I think the gangsters dropped you at the wrong location.
So how long have you known Tony and Carmella?
This piece really speaks to me.
I've heard the first week of sobriety is the hardest.
A guests will be released once having crushed at lease ten litres of grapes.
"So how do you like our new severance package?'
So, how did the refinancing meeting go?
So, I understand that you're here to learn more about the Republican Party
Yes, yes - but what else have you done since graduation?
Feel free to loosen up and roam around
Here. Drink this. It'll loosen you up.
So how are the kids doing?
I don't care what Google Maps says, I can assure you this is NOT the East River!!
Do you get away much?
Can I freshen up your concrete?
Captivating party...isn't it?
So, how long have you two known Vinny?
OK, don't stare, but Susan's blouse is just hideous.
Nothing a little red wine will cure, is it?
Well , at least your not joined at the hip
Date night?
You seem to be a very grounded couple.
We call it, water Bordeauxing.
So, who roped you into attending this ballet school fundraiser?
Welcome to Chicago.
I know how it is. The shoes fit in the store and when you get home, they feel like concrete blocks.
You two seem quiet today.
At least it's a step up from last week's potato sack race.
...So I always say why be knitwit when you can crochet all day. But my grammy always said...
I told you to not order the white zin, but no you wouldn't listen.
Well, look what the catfish dragged in.
So, why don't you want to drink the cool-aid?
Let me guess: Couples counseling? Role playing gone overboard? Been there.
Since you can't leave, let's talk about me.
Would You Like a Nightcap?
The buzz is that you guys may be out of favor with the boss.
You were warned not to sue the co-op board
OK, last question. On a scale of one to ten, where one is 'just doing their jobs" and ten is "true heroes" how would you rate the flight attendants?
I get so tired of everybody and his brother referring to themselves as 'survivors,' don't you?
Do you two need a ride home tonight?
So, you want them shaken, not stirred.
Perhaps so... but no one goes unpunished for texting at a Myra Rosenbaum party.
'Tied up at home' is not an excuse for being late.
That's funny--I had a really rough week, too.
So tell me....How did you get roped into this?
Let me guess- you didn't want to come, but your hands were tied.
Relax, planted supporters will be cut loose after everyone leaves.
Thank you for volunteering to be my captive audience.
I assumed "tied up" meant you would not be attending.
Step 13?
Well, I bet you won't mistake Syrah for Merlot again.
So you guys for or against?
So, will this be your first cruise?
If you get a chance, try the red.
I didn't see any straws
Glad you could come. You're always so tied up.
So, I'm told you're both in concrete.
What a great party, you both are the best HOSTages!
You dared to bring red wine when you knew we were having fish?
I know, marriage is never easy.
Some artists have patrons. I have an enforcer.
Cheers!
I have only enough liquid to water one of you.
What did you think "The Abramovic Experience" meant?
I hear you brought Australian wine.
I should have mentioned that he doesn't take criticism of his work very well.
Lucky you, invited to the after party!
Your foot punch is delicious.
I'm sorry to inform you that we are drownsizing your department, effective immediately.
I'm so sorry you are leaving early
You should have taken the upgrades.
So glad you're staying for the investment strategy presentation.
Tony said to tell you bon voyage.
Okay now. Tell me again why you don’t like President Trump?
Well, enough about me.
Your paintings aren't selling, but I have an offer from a couple who want to install you in their foyer.
You'll find the '08 Lafite goes great with the Hudson.
As you can see, we have a concrete plan.
We thought the invitation said "Blackened and Tied"
So you're following the "no-willpower needed" diet.
Oh, the pool party's tomorrow: didn't Tony tell you?
You might like to try this one. Nice and dry with a light, buoyant aspect that seems to just float above the palate...
I think they're watering down the drinks too.
Looks like you could really use a pick-me-up
Of course you're under no obligation.
Soon it won't be awkward to unfriend you guys.
And I used to have Republican friends.
Did you have any trouble getting here?
I'm not a fan of cement shoes before Memorial Day, but my husband, "The Don", is no fashionista.
You're still not listening. I'm telling you it's a wine you can't refuse.
Yes, you're making a statement. That part I've got.
I like being single; so many of my friends are stuck in bad marriages.
Remind me what thing you’re raising awareness of.
It's a real shame you won't be joining us for dinner.
Wow, you must have done something really naughty to have been dumped off here.
Looks like you'll be dropping in for the fish dinner.
You must be the new introverts in 4C.
We really need to get together when the two of you aren't so tied up.
Are you part of the exhibit finale at the East River?
So, tomorrow's the big day! Nervous?
Well! Here's to the fishes!
Why, yes, of course we'll do all we can to keep you on the wagon.
Those buckets are so last year. I wouldn't be caught dead in those ropes.
I pronounce you husband and wife for better or worse
Well, Ivanka and Jared, I'll bet you're sorry you decided to crash Elizabeth Warren's summer party.
Then I suppose there will be no dancing tonight?"
That is So Gangster!
So, tying the knot was on your bucket list. Cheers!
I've learned a lot by watching you two.
Stop me if you've heard this.
Like we discussed in our session, escaping only reinforces your social anxiety. Now, mingle and relax.
I love the idea of installation art incorporating mob retribution.
That investigation into our company's financial records was eye opening. Management finally noticed you. Congratulations on getting the attention you deserve. By the way, if you don't mind me asking, what kind of bonus are you getting?
Stomp faster. We are running low on red
Congratulations on the marriage. So when did you tie the knot?
It's our new required attendance policy.
Thank you so much for coming.
It's sacramental wine. And don't forget the blessing!
'I didn't know AA added a 13th step."
Ayn Rand toasts two Scientology whistleblowers.
When did you two decide to tie the knot?
We're almost out - here's what it's supposed to taste like when you're done.
and if you survive the swimming test, we'll know you did not lie on your immigration application.
I always read the Terms and Conditions before accepting.
Our office parties have never been popular.
I'll be happy to see my ex take the plunge.
I'm sorry you won't be donating this year but I understand your hands are tied.
That's interesting. So how long have you both worked for the mob?
Is this an installation or outsider art?
Well if your not in a rush to leave can I tell you all about my operation?
I'd like to ask the curator if you come as a set or individual pieces.
I understand you're tonight's entertainment.
I'm so glad that you decided to stay!
Now that I have your attention...
I didn't expect to see you guys. Rocky said you were tied up. Something about deep sea fishing with some friends of his.
So YOU were the ones who opened the Beaujolais nouveau a day early!
Me? Same old, same old. And you guys, anything new?
Are you the artists or the art?
Tony wants to know if you remembered to stop the mail.
Jane, it's because you didn't pay back the mob. Bill, it's that tie.
What took you so long to get here?
I am so impressed. It’s not every couple that can pull off that bondage, buckets and bad hair look.
So you are quitting smoking, drinking, and buffets? Wow. Kudos.
We're going to have to do things that are unthinkable.
I take it you knew Larry in his 'Bad Boy' phase.
So you're saying you wouldn't give up your berth?
You should meet my ex. In every argument he said I would play the victim.
Enough about me. What's your story?
... then she asked me if I was near-sighted, so I told her they're just for show, then she said...
...we just find some of your views questionable.
Payback is always on my bucket list.
Literalists, are we?
And "Goodfellas"? I just can't get enough of Scorsese.
We both forgot our safe word.
Did I hear one of you say, "I thirst."?
Thank you for taking such an interest in my newfound veganism!
I've been meaning to ask you both, what about our new management keeps you up at night?
And now how will you be voting on the repeal of Obamacare?
You must be the new Russian spies who have planted here.
Feel free to peruse my artwork.
So, I guess you two aren't thinking of having children"
I sometimes feel that way at these things too.
Maybe it was a bad idea to solicit gallery funding from the mob.
Please enjoy the wine; it's complimentary.
You're not seeing the big picture.
It's not like we are forcing you to stay.
Ahh I love the river. Full of charm and mystery. You must tell me all about it.
The first rule of Wine Night is you do NOT talk about Wine Night.
I drink to your willpower.
The rope really brings the outfit together.
Welcome to Amnesty Local.
Maybe next time you'll think twice about bringing a wine rated under 92.
Which swamp were you drained from?
I'm the mainstream media. Here's your evening news.
when we said no employee fraternization we meant it.
You shouldn't have said you enjoy Moscato.
Donald will be right back with the duct tape.
No, wait, don't tell me. Let me guess. They were fresh out of lethal cocktails.
Did you have to be so literal?
Separate beds, OK; But even Lucy and Desi would do this communally.
You came. I thought you'd be too tied up!
When Don Corleone offered you some wine, you shouldn't have refused.
Loosen up!
You did not RSVP
We're waiting. All the East River bridges are full of Hillary supporters until tomorrow. All mob activity is being delayed.
Your political views are just not acceptable to our party.
Small chance of rain.
So what else is new?
Great, we can take up the conversation where we left it at the last party....
Hemlock instead?
Can you stay for the timeshare resort presentation?
Ready to take the plunge?
This wine has more of a toes than a nose, please wash your feet next time.
Congratulations! You were on my bucket list.
We apologize for any inconvenience.
We'd love to donate to your charity but you see, our hands are tied.
You smell like shit!
Would you care for a little wine too loosen up and enjoy the party?
I hope meeting the new President hasn't been too tortuous for you.
Have you ever heard of AA?
Not to worry. The water in the East river is not very cold this time of year.
We call it sink'n'drink.
Shall I tie one on?
L' Chaim
Bobbing for apples OR the three-legged race, not both at once
Congratulations, you are both tied for Employee of the Month

Looks like the total immersion program was pretty challenging.
I love what you have done with your hair.
The torture exhibit isn't until tomorrow
Tom and I decided not to have kids.
At least you don't have to suffer this dreadful Merlot.
I'm telling you Joan, this couples therapist can work miracles.
Brad, I forgave you for your indiscretions and for the divorce, but when you married Sunshine, you both went on my bucket list.
A nice Chianti...an unfortunate misunderstanding. Dr Hannibal said "I'd like to marinade the Livingstones before we have them for dinner," not "I'd like to serenade the Livingtones before we have them for dinner."
Matching outfits? A little tacky don't you think?
So I hear you're going for a little swim after the party.
We met on tinder.
...and would you like to see some pictures of my colon surgery....?
We reserve the right to remove anyone whose behavior compromises the enjoyment of other passengers.
Sorry all we have is a zesty red; too bold for fish.
So the winery tour guide was serious when he said those caught picking the grapes will be severely punished.
Potted, or tying one on?
I heard this wine pairs great with sleeping with the fishes.
Well, you were warned not to eat all the cheese.
With the Fishes? I never knew they swung.
Thanks, but we'll have to pass. We're tied up right now.
The new director is a literalist. I'd also avoid "over my dead body" and "sticks and stones".
You two were made for each other.
I'm going to give you some time to think it over, but to me the deal is a no brainer.
Honestly, it's like torture getting information out of you two.
Have you noticed they always serve cheap domestic wine at these Whistleblower parties?
It has a taste of remorse
Keep drinking until you fill the bucket.
I, too, heard this would be the party to end all parties, but I didn't take it literally!
And now how will you be voting on the repeal of Obamacare?
Decaying performance art. Interesting.
This doesn't taste like your feet yet. Keep stomping!
Care for a drink before going into it?
I'm guessing he forgot to tell you there is a MRS. Eliot Spritzer.
Relax. Once you've tried the hot tub, you'll love it.
I can't remember dates either, that's why I use autopay.
It's an interesting live art interpretation
I told you I had a good attorney.
While we are waiting for the cement to harden may I offer you each a sip of wine?
It's so good you introverts could stay a little longer.
You do know if this were Dad you'd be in the river already?
I'd be happy to recommend some large bodies of water.
I hear you're taking a cruise.
I never got into that his 'n' hers stuff.
For what it's worth, I think you two nailed the presentation.

The gallery has gotten cold feet and decided not to include your performance art at the public opening. Sorry, my hands are tied... Oh!
Good news: the cement will be soon be set and we'll be done with this boring reception.
Does this mean you won't be attending the block party?
