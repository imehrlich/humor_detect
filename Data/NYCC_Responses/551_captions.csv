Row v. Wave
We shall overcomb.
Row v. Wave
I don't know what's worse, the undertow or the combover
Don't worry, the polls show it will miss us.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you look to your right, you’ll see a gift of friendship from the people of France; straight ahead, a gift of friendship from the people of Russia
You've got it all wrong. We're emigrating.
Mayday! We've been hit by a raging tycoon!
To think this started as a Twitter storm.
We shall overcomb.
Did you just say there will be hell toupee?
I'm the perfect storm..the best storm, everybody tells me that.
Don't worry --if you're not a 10 it won't touch you.
Huge wave, really terrific. But such tiny hands.
Unpresidented weather we're having.
Attention Everyone! Small hands on deck!
All together now! 'Rue, rue, rue your vote . . .'
'In retrospect, maybe the Cruz ship was a safer bet.'
It's a great wave. The best wave. No wave has ever been better.
The scariest part is how shallow it is!
Everybody, lean left!
Relax ... it's just Alec Baldwin.
Don't sweat it -- he switches direction every two seconds.
I was expecting a wall.
Small hands on deck!
Hell AND high water?!
Woe, woe, woe your vote...
Ha ha ha, good one. Now do Putin riding on a seahorse!
There will be hell toupee!
Small hands on deck!
Something tells me this wave is going to touch us inappropriately.
Everyone take a deep breath and hold it for four years!
It's a foam over.
Thar he bloviates!
We're about to experience extreme wetting!
Quick! Tweet something to distract him.
Have we huddled masses arrived at a bad time?
Don't worry. It's only Alec Baldwin.
That's a surprise. All the forecasts said we'd be seeing Hillary.
I thought "tweeting up a storm" was just a saying.
It's OK—we're Russian.
Hold on, everyone. Hell AND high water are coming.
Oh for heaven's sake, Ruthie, you're seeing him everywhere now.
The storm suddenly appeared out of thin hair.
Ok stay calm! Take a deep breath and hold it for four years!
Whatever you do, don't mention the little hands.
Quick - compliment him on something!
Quick everyone. Shout out compliments.
On second thought, let's yearn to be free somewhere else.
Hold on, everyone. We've got hell AND high water coming.
It looks just like Alec Baldwin!
I knew there'd be hell toupee.
Be careful, These waves usually come in gropes.
How did we not see this coming?
Tycoon season is early this year!
Hold on, everyone. We've got hell AND high water coming.
But we're trying to leave the country, not enter it.
Everybody lean to the right.
They're called twitter storms.
Wait! We're deplorables.
I think I'm about to experience extreme wetting.
Looks like you've got a small dinghy, too.
And to your right, you'll catch our last glimpse of Lady Liberty for quite some time.
Freak wave, ahead! Hope you all have strong Constitutions.
On a positive note, it's not a permanent wave.
Take a deep breath and hold it for four years.
Look, it's Alec Baldwin!
Just try to stay calm and look deplorable.
Irrefutable evidence the climate has changed.
Don't worry, this is almost statistically impossible.
They lied. It can get worse.
No, I said the weather looked "Alt-right" today.
Moby Dickhead!
Comboverboard!
Yes, we're tired, poor, and huddled. But, actually, we're headed to Canada.
Don't panic. Just hold your breath for four years.
Unfortunately, garbage from New York sometimes finds its way into the Hudson.
Relax. We're not immigrants. We're from the French embassy. We're taking back the statue.
I've never seen an anti-immigrant wave like this!
I would have preferred a wall.
Comboverboard!
Hold tight, these tweet-storms are unpredictable....
Hold on, everything is going to be Alt-Right!
This wasn't in the forecast until January.
It's gonna grab us by the dinghy!
Oh for God sake Shirley ... you can't blame EVERYTHING on him!
Giant metaphor off the starboard bow!
I think we’re screwed. It’s a Category 4 Tweetstorm.
So this is what he meant by extreme wetting.
Get ready for extreme wetting.
It's a tidal weave
Technically this is more of a hell AND high water situation!
Steer for the mouth! There's nothing behind it but a yuge void!
It's gonna be swell. Believe me.
Don't worry, it'll comb over.
Stop laughing at his tiny whitecaps. It makes him angry.
This is what happens when really hot air condenses.
Let's hope it's not a permanent wave
WRONG. I tweeted Extreme Wetting
Like a comb-over troubled water, he will let you down...
Nobody saw it coming?
Pray it's not a permanant wave.
Quick. Show him your tits.
Relax! We're trying to get to Canada.
Tidal weave!
Give it your phone! It needs to tweet!
Ladies! Cross your legs!
We're gonna need a bigger comb.
If you think this storm is making dangerous waves now, wait until it hits the Potomac.
Quick! Throw him your iPhones. Once he starts Tweeting, we break for shore.
I thought you said the storm would blow over, not comb-over...
Hold your breath... For four years.
Our choices are clear: row versus wade.
#StatueofLiberty message outdated, so sad.
We said we'd get there come hell or high water, not both.
I vote we take our tired, huddled asses and head for Canada.
He’s just not happy unless he’s making waves.
I say we paddle to Canada until this whole thing combs over.
On second thought, let's row back to Cuba.
ACTUALLY, WE'RE LEAVING!!!
Oh no! We're being swept under the rug.
No doubt this is due to political climate change.
Well, the forecasters were wrong.
And when you’re a tsunami, they let you do it. You can do anything.
Not tired. Not sick. Not poor. I swear!
Look, I'm a tremendous wave. Tremendous. And a lot of people are talking about me. A lot of people.
I have the best surf. My surf is tremendous.
So, literally caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
Watch out for the little hands, they can grab your whatever.
What's the worst that could happen?
Brace yourselves--looks like a populist wave.
Don't worry. There's no way he can win.
Somehow, winning the popular boat isn't making me feel any safer.
Don't worry, it's unpresidented.
We're with her.
We expected amber waves of grain, not orange waves of pain.
Es El Gropo!
It's The Donald...Duck!
It's going to grab us by the dingy!
Of course, it's him. Look at the size of his hands.
Huh. There actually is an anti-immigrant wave.
So that's what a wave of populism looks like.
I liked it better when he just tweeted.
Unless you're Mexican, Moslem, African-American, democratic, liberal or female there's nothing to be afraid of.
Quick, look less huddled!
Actually, we were just leaving.
Relax, people. It's only a metaphor.
ACTUALLY, WE'RE LEAVING!!!
Don’t be alarmed, folks. It’s just a Trump l’oeil”
Here comes the extreme wetting!
Mayday! Mayday! Small hands on deck.
And he’s going to make El Niño pay for it.
They're tired. They're poor. They're huddled masses yearning to breathe free. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.
Thar he blows!
Everyone, quick, stop huddling and look white!
Ladies! Watch the hands, not the wave!
Relax. The polls show we'll be just fine.
Oh God - it's the wave of the future!
Pretend we're a basket of deplorables.
The American Dream may be dead, but the American Nightmare is alive and well.
It's got small hands but a lot of wind!
Just wait. He's going to make tsunamis great again.
Hold on to your pussies.
Don't worry, they say he's more foam than substance.
Tired? Poor? Yearning to breathe free? Not sending their best. Sad.
It’s either a sea change or a wave of regret.
We should have taken our chances with the wall.
Here we go, get ready to hold your breathe for four years.
He wasn't kidding about "extreme wetting" of immigrants.
I told you this river was polluted.
But, we're trying to emigrate, not immigrate!
Don't worry! Everything is going to be Alt-Right.
It's not a wave. It's just a comb-over.
All together now, We shall overcomb-o-o-omb.
Comb-overboard! Comb-overboard!
Start spreading the news, we're leaving today.
I am afraid that this is the wave of the future.
The Alt-White Caps!
We remind our female passengers to keep their privates inside the vessel at all times
It's called a 'So Sue Me Nami.
Nothing to worry about, folks. Just a media storm.
Egads, it's all foam and no substance.
Just compliment him and he'll go away.
But we’re trying to leave!
But we already gave him our tired and poor....they elected him!
Oh great... a perfect Twitter storm!
Little hands, big mouth … yep we're here.
Well, who saw this coming?
Now that's climate change.
What would Sully do?
Which way to Canada?
Don't worry; it's only a foam-over.
Relax! We're not coming in, we're running away!
That couldn't possibly be a permanent wave.
Well it's no more unbelievable than him winning the election!
That's pretty good! Do Bill Clinton again.
Oh no, it’s YUGE.
We're fucked.
I don't think he gets we're trying to LEAVE America.
I told you the climate has changed!
He's going to make drowning great again.
Honest Mr. Trump, we're not coming in, we're trying to leave!
OK, who said small hands on deck?
Hold on! We're leaving, not arriving.
Don't worry it's Trump l'oeil.
We just need to make it over the toupée.
Trumpnami! Steer alt right and try to look white and male.
You had to go and name the boat "Democracy."
I'm just glad Trump is finally reaching out to undecided boaters
Amnesty? We're from Jersey!
Thar he blowshard!
It ought to blow over in four years.
Did the forecast call for blowhard conditions?
I didn't realize we'd all wind up in the same boat.
Maybe it won't be that bad.
I told you we should have steered left.
Uh oh. The forecasters didn't see this one coming.
Don't worry, that's just a tycoon, not a typhoon.
I think we're in the hair of the storm!
Let's wait to see what actually happens.
Be calm people, it's only a metaphor.
Take a deep breath and hold it for four years.
Après Obama, le déluge.
Have no fear, we shall overcomb.
And this concludes our tour of the signs of the Apocalypse.
If that's the wave of the future, I'm going overboard.
Excuse me, do you know the way to America? I think we've gone too far right.
This thing'll be catastrophic by the time it reaches Washington.
We're gonna need a whiter boat"
Fuck.
Careful, your next wife is on board!
Oh! It's a metaphor!
Let's just hope it's not a permanent wave.
Give me your greedy, your rich, Your ambitious masses yearning to cash in.
I told it that we're just a group of models from Slovenia! We should be fine.
I still don't trust Hillary.
Anyone else feeling boater's remorse?
I thought we had until Inauguration Day!
Look out! It's a wave of anti-immigrant resentment!
It looks like a tweet storm is brewing.
Is this what they mean by extreme wetting?
Apparently riding a wave of anti-immigrant sentiment is not just a metaphor.
As it turned out, rising sea levels was not the greatest oceanic threat
He's saying we should comb over to the dark side.
I'm afraid this is a permanent wave!
Oh, I thought he said he was a *tycoon*.
Don't worry. It's only a trump l'oeil.
You know that sinking feeling I've been talking about?
So this is how we'll get a big, beautiful, forty-foot sea wall. And New Jersey is going to pay for it.
All hands on groins ladies!
So much for draining the swamp.
Remember-- just hold your breath for 4 years and we should be ok
I'm pretty sure it is not a permanent wave.
Idiot! We are trying to leave, not enter!
Show of hands, who wants to go back to Aleppo?
It's ok. Just tell him we're beauty pageant contestants.
"We're trying to EMIGRATE!! EMIGRATE!!.... WITH AN E!
Hold on! We're about to shoot the comb over!
Even the New Yorker Cartoon Caption Contest can't make this funny.
Excuse me, could you point us in the direction of Canada?
I hear once we get past the groping, tiny, tidal hands, there is just a lot of hot air.
We're having a Hate Wave...a Trumpical Hate Wave!
Give me your tired, your poor — I'll deport them.
Whatever you do, don't make fun of his fingers.
'Not my Tsunami'
I hope he realizes we're the Goldman Sachs rowing team and not the tired, poor, huddled masses.
We're gonna need a whiter boat"
We'll be fine we're a boatload of deplorables.
I think that statue is giving him the finger
Uh oh. I thought 'impending wave of disaster' was just a metaphor.
Brace yourself, it's another twitter storm
We used to call these waves, but now we call them gropes.
Somehow it's not looking like a wave of optimism.
Farmer's Almanac predicts four years of storm metaphors.
If we all pull hard to the left, we will get through this. Ready?!
Not to worry: In a moment, he'll change his mind.
Attention! Attention! Small hands on deck!
I knew about the wall, but no one told me about the permanent wave.
We call this one the groper
It's a good thing Trump doesn't have the reading level necessary for The New Yorker.
Look, the land of the tweet and home of the depraved.
Calm down. We're leaving.
Maybe it won't be that bad.
New management, folks. Accepting only your rested and rich.
But she invited us.
No, No, No! We're from Staten Island.
It's not a tsunami, it's a wave of discontent.
He's making our oceans great again.
We're tired, we're poor, and you're creepy!
Clear the comb-over and we're home free.
The media said there was no chance this storm would actually hit the U.S.
This isn't how I pictured the amber waves.
Don't worry, It's just another Twitter storm!
And this here folks is the Populist Wave of 2016.
Just our luck to arrive on a bad hair day
Hold on to your pussies.
This rising tide lifts only yachts.
Watch out ladies, here comes another grabber wave.
Which one of you made fun of his wave?
Thar he blows!
Is it me or does the crest look fake?
This is not the wave of the future I was expecting.
We're tired, poor, and yearning for impeachment.
No one saw this coming.
And the cast of 'Hamilton' set out for a three-hour tour.
I would have been happier with a wall
Maybe we should come back in four years.
H-u-u-g-e !
Let's just give it a chance...what's the worst that could happen?
Hang on everyone, it's a rogue weave!!
More than half of us wanted the other wave.
Don't worry - you can't take him literally.
Don't panic; it's the Statue of Liberty he's after.
Is that a permanent wave?
This doesn't look like a passing storm to me.
Don't worry. It's only a tweet storm.
Look, a wave of nausea.
Hey--it's Alec Baldwin!
Just keep rowing, it's just a tiny-handed blowhard.
Looks like someone's Twitter feed is down.
Hold On! This is when it usually reverses direction.
Somehow trying to see the humor in it is only makes it worse.
It's a populist wave.
Tell it we're emigrating, not immigrating.
Everything reminds me of him.
Careful - these's waves can grab you by the dingy.
We're tired, we're poor, we're yearning to breathe free. What could go wrong?
He's saying, "Give me your rested, your well-fed, your rich, yearning to breathe really terrific things."
It's the imperfect storm.
Don't worry. It's just Alec Baldwin having some fun.
I told you it was a permanent wave.
You may be able to stop people coming in, but you can't keep us from leaving.
Careful ladies! This tidal wave likes to grab.
They should have never taken away his Twitter account.
Just scream 'Debt Collectors" and watch it back off
He's delivering on his promise to make waves
This is where they drained the swamp.
You're right, it's nothing but sound and fury, signifying nothing.
It's just the overflow from draining the swamp.
Of course that’s him. Look at the tiny hands.
I know waves, I have the best waves.
You Don't Understand! We Want to Leave!
I've got models aboard.
We're gonna need a bigger boat...and really big comb.
People told us we might run into waves of anti-immigrant sentiment.
The waves are often biggest where it's shallow. Hang on!
Don't worry, we'll be fine. Look at the size of those hands!
Looks like they built a squall.
That's the wave of anti-immigration sentiment.
Don't worry it's Trump l'oeil.
From a distance it looked like a welcome mat.
I really though "tweet-storm" was just a figure of speech.
The election was not won by a landslide... just a tidal bore.
Relax, we're Canadians.
The polls say we have nothing to worry about.
Give me your wealthy, your entitled.
Rogue wave from the right!
Tweet me Ishmail.
Small hands, but big mouth.
But the forecast on Fox News promised smooth sailing!
The good news is that we're all in the same boat....
It's just a bad foam-over...
Hey--it's Alec Baldwin!
Watch out below deck, ladies.
We probably should've seen this coming.
Quick, tell it we're with Goldman Sachs!
Everyone, compliment the wave.
Now hear this....small hands on deck !
So do we take this seriously or literally?
Such a nasty wave.
It's him! I'd recognize those tiny hands anywhere.
Gosh, we thought we had until January 20th to escape!
Not a wave, just a comb-over, folks
Wow ... he really DOES have tiny hands!
Careful, it's moving further right.
Just imagine when it hits Washington
I thought he said "extreme vetting !"
,,,your huddled masses yearning to breathe free? Sad.
Huddle, masses!
There's only one way it'll spare us... hoist the Russian flag!
Boy, the tides sure are turning.
Okay, I guess the tired and the poor get off here, now.
Maybe they should change it to 'Come hell AND high water'!
don't worry - the storm will soon comb over!
Wow... What tiny little hands...
Many hands - All tiny. Sad!
...the land of the free and the comb-over wave
Oh no! It's an entidaled wave!
Prepare for swamping!
Looks like Trump has tweeted up another storm!!
Hold onto your pussies; it's a big one!
Don't worry -- it's just a hoax invented by the Chinese!
On second thought, we're not THAT yearning.
Keep paddling and whatever you do, don't mention the tiny hands!
Let' make rowing great again!
Alright. Who tweeted?!
That's quite a feat, considering he doesn't know the meaning of the word anthropomorphic.
Wasn't the apocalypse scheduled for January 20th?
Like we need reminding why we're all leaving
Small hands, big mouth, comb over: we can ride this one out.
I thought he was going to build a wall.
It's a tweetstorm!
Does anyone speak Russian?
Hold on everyone, this is gonna be HUGE!
Don't worry. It's just over-compensating for its tiny hands.
It's HUUUUUUUUGE!
Wait, wait, we're all related to your next wife!
So much for draining the swamp.
Stay calm, it's only a Twitter rant.
Hold on! Things are about to get hairy.
But everyone said this couldn't happen
Keep rowing and it'll be over in four years.
No worries folks. It's mostly hot air.
You know, a wall sounds pretty good right now.
He's gotten real creative with 'The Wall' concept.
We're gonna need a bigger comb.
Who's for trying Canada?
I don't think you understand, we are trying to get out!
None of us are immigrants, right?
Quick, everyone form a huddled mass!
Hairicane Donald lashes East Coast with gale-force rhetoric.
It's even uglier up close.
I keep having this nightmare that Trump won the election
It's YUGE, it's TERRIFYING, and we're ALL in the same boat!
That lady said to let us in.
I think I prefer the wall.
Wow! The crest of that wave never moves!
I thought the slogan was "huddled masses..." not "befuddled asses."
And our tour ends with climate change.
Look, he does have small hands.
Should've known something was up when the water turned orange.
What do sailors say about orange sky?
Stop tweeting and it'll go away.
No worries. Forecasters say there's a 90% chance it won't amount to anything.
Can't blame this on global warming.
I'm the biggest wave. I'm HUGE. Tremendous.
And this, folks, is the Wave of the Future. I promise you, it's gonna be yuge!
See those tiny hands reaching out to rescue us from that nasty woman with the big torch?
Which way to the Statue of Limitations?
The hair looks especially angry today.
Hurry ! Tweet something nice !
Looks like we are about to get groped!
Toss out Alec Baldwin now!
It looks bad but it's mostly hot air.
All women on board immediately cross your legs. This is not a drill.
Just pretend we're all rich, white, Christian males, and he'll let us pass.
Illegals? Actually we are the inaurgaration band
Keep rowing. It's only a trompe l'oeil.
'You're gonna need a bigger vote.'
It's the tiny hands that really creaps me out.
Don't worry, those little hands were only made for tweeting
Look out, it's a gropenami!
Look! a Trumpe-l'œil.
I was warned we might be blocked by that real estate typhoon.
From this close you can tell it's not real.
Which of you assholes said, "give us liberty or give us death?"
That wave looks a lot like Alec Baldwin.
Can you blow us toward Canada?
Well, this trumps Moby Dick.
I hope this storm combs over.
I'm a New Yorker, and I know a con when I see one.
Hey I see a very small sea cucumber!
Relax, it's just a trumped up wave.
He's making waves great again!
This will be HUGE!
Brace yourself, it's opening its mouth again.
Whatever you do, don't make fun of his hair.
Not only didn't the swamp get drained, it looks like it overflowed into the Hudson.
Don't blame me - I voted for Hillary!
Better turn back. I hear it's a four-year blow.
All things considered, I'd prefer a white whale.
If anyone's a constitutional lawyer, now's the time to speak up.
It's not a real tsunami--it's just a comb-over.
Look out, this one's a grabber!
And to think I laughed at the thought of Trump 'tweeting up a storm'.
Hang on. We're about to get trickled down on.
Let's come back in 4 years.
This is our wave of the future!
Is she waving goodbye?
We should have taken the Holland Tunnel
Say he's brilliant and he'll wave you in.
Look out! It's a tycoonphoon!
It is a wave or a weave?
Let's turn around. They've ammended their constitution down to 140 characters.
It's true! Even the ocean thinks he's a joke.
Must be backwash from the swamp draining.
This wasn't in the forecast.
And when a butterfly flaps its wings in Moscow...
Did Mexico pay for this?
I say we shoot the curl!
We're gonna need a bit bigger vote.
Maybe we can just ride this one out.
The New Yorker used to be funny, now a failing magazine that never picks the funny captions for their contest. Sad!
All in favor of diverting to Canada say aye!
The tide has obviously turned on illegal immigration.
Now that's a sea change!
Look out for the foam-over.
Hold on, everybody! We're about to be extremely wetted.
Relax. This, too, shall comb over.
It's every man for himself. Women, lotsa luck!
Here's where we conclude our tour.
No more huddled masses! Oh, you're trying to leave.
Don't worry. The mouth is big, but the hands are tiny.
See, I told you we'd be welcomed with open arms.
Oh, Trump said "extreme wetting".
Are you sure he said we're not getting in without 'extreme wetting?'
Keep rowing, people. This boat's been seaworthy for two hundred years.
Rogue weave dead ahead!
He's going to make Staten Island great again!
Geez-- The Circle Line Tours were a lot safer during the Obama administration!
Just keep rowing and bailing for four more years and we should be okay.
Whoa, we're not coming to America, we're leaving!
Don't be afraid! Check out his hands, he's overcompensating for a tiny under tow.
Wow, that's quite the pour-over!
Angry white squall!
I said we're emigrating, not immigrating.
I think the new immigration policy is about to take effect.
Looks like it's blowing over.
Work visas? Hell no! We're with Melania.
'Not my Tsunami'
Let's give it a chance.
tell him we are a basket of deplorable
Don't worry, all the forecasts say it won't affect us.
I told you we should have just climbed the wall.
Folks, let's all try to give the Apocalypse a fair chance.
Okay, can we all agree this is the last Trump cartoon until the next election?
give me your fat, your rich, your overfed.
Don't you worry your pretty little hands, Putin sent us.
Once we cross the Sea of Tiny Hands it should be smooth sailing.
Wow!! I never saw a tidal wave with such small hands!
Quick everyone paddle left
But we're not immigrants! We're just out on a boat ride!
Recalculating, ...
Heads up! It's the Orange Crush!
See, it's a wave, not a comb-over.
Holy Crap! It's the wave of the future!
The doomed boat of deplorables
When is this fucking acid going to wear off?
We're about to go comb-overboard.
OMG! It's the GRIM GROPER!
Off the bow you'll see a hoax perpetrated by the Russians.
Ladies, batten down your hatches.
How do we stop him from grabbing Lady Liberty?
The weather started getting rough - the tiny ship was tossed. If not for the courage of the fearless crew democracy would be lost.
Hang on. We are in for a rough four years.
Don't worry, folks. Climate change is just a hoax.
It can't be Trump, he doesn't believe in global warming.
Making boating great again!
We're tired, we're poor...What the hell do we have to lose?!
I guess the huddled masses aren't as welcome as they used to be.
Maybe we should have climbed the wall!
I say we wait and see what happens.
Quick, break out the hair net!
Don't fret, ladies! The hands may be all over the place, but they are rather small.
Just think - the "Make America Wetter" theme all started because of a typo!
Small hands, small dinghy.
It's not funny anymore.
We've reached the first security checkpoint.
No more "Give me your tired..." Now it's "You're Fired!"
Yes, it is as bad as it looks.
Oh no, a wave of the future.
The Great Trump L'Oeil off Manhattan
Remember the drill, ladies—arms and legs crossed.
Another alt-whitecap!

Take back your tired, your poor, your huddled masses
Brace yourselves; I don't think we can ride the populist wave
You just had to mention his comb-over.
It may be just hyperbole, folks.
Keep calm. It'll blow over in four years.
Give me your tiared, your rich, Your hubric massahs yearning to be tax free, The wealthy refuse you from our teeming shore. Spurn these, the homeless, tempest-tossed we see. I lift my lamp to block the golden door.
Who would've thought that THIS was the face of global warming?
We got past the damn wall and now this?
you call that a boat...sad.
It's yuge!
Not to worry, it's just a passing tweetstorm.
The worst red tide we've seen in years.
Wait! We are emigrating not immigratiing.
We're safe.....it's just the swamp draining.
I told you not to bring up the Electoral College.
Um--I think this will swamp the drain.
Keep rowing, everyone - things are about to get real hairy.
We're supposed to take it seriously but not literally.
But we're from Staten Island!
Tweet for help!
Such small hands...
Tiny hands for such a big wave.
It's a good likeness; note the tiny hands and huge mouth!
Twitter was bad enough. Now it's surfing the internet.
Who tweeted?
Looks like the new immigration screening is in effect.
Twitter must be down he's now resorting to theatrics.
I knew he wanted to be God, but Moses too?
We're the mariachi band Little Marco hired for the Inauguration.
I'll only let you in if you call me the 'perfect' storm.
I will build a great wave–and nobody builds waves better than me, believe me, and I will make Mexico pay for that wave.
Give me your money, you tired and huddled masses, then go back you came from.
The other ride won the popular vote.
Nobody in this boat said your hair looked funny
All small hands on deck!
Making low tide great again
' Super Storm Asshole '
Trumpocalypse
Get out your Green Cards!
It doesn't look like we're gonna make it to Canada.
Now he's making ocean travel great again.
It's called a Trump Wave. It will drown and kill us, but our deaths will be fantastic. They will be marvelous deaths. Great deaths. Believe me.
There's really nothing funny about this.
It's yuge!
If we're lucky, it'll just be another one of those blow-overs.
Comb-over? I thought they said come over!
Populist wave, dead ahead!
Batten down your panties, ladies!
My, what small whitecaps you have!
The last one this bad was in 2000.
Quick - get out the hair spray>
Oh, here comes 2017.
Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses, and I'll send them back to wherever they came from.
Have you ever seen such little hands on a tidal wave?
I think we're heading in the wrong direction.
Ladies, hold on to your p---sies.
The wave is bad but I assure the the undertow will be worse.
Uh oh! Looks like the new immigration policy's already been put in place!
On second thought, maybe it wasn't so bad back home.
You think the election was surreal? How about being stuck with him in a Japanese woodblock print?
They're cutting back on huddled masses.
We shouldn't have said we'd leave if he was elected!!!
OK. I'll take your tired and huddled masses, but no poor.
Sure has small hands for such a big wave.
Man--his hands ARE tiny.
I guess this is what he meant by 'extreme vetting.'
Well, doesn't this just sum up 2016 perfectly.
Watch out for the little hands!
First a wall. Now this!
That wave does not look natural.
And amber waves of insane…
A wave? I thought he was building a wall.
Don't worry, it's mostly bluster.
Don't worry, it's going to pivot to the mainstream any second now.
The Art of the Wave.
Big mouth--yet such tiny hands.
Entitled wave!
Brace yourselves, ladies. This one's looking grabby!
That wave is Yuge! There has never been one that is Yuger! Ask Anyone.
All things considered, it's amazing how small it's hands are.
I'm sure you said tycoon, not typhoon!
The wave of the future?
Don't worry - I always wake up from this dream right about now.
I think it wants us to throw Rosie O'Donnell overboard
Take it literally or seriously - either way, we're sunk.
He thinks everything south of 57th street is on the border with Mexico.
Gives you a slight feeling of impending doom, doesn't it?
It's OK. We've been accepted for kitchen work at Mar-a-Lago.
Don't worry. A wave like this can't possibly win.
The tides have turned.
Who would have thought that global warming had a sense of humor?
That fucking Comey!
#notourwave
I even made the Wave Great again. Look, I am the Great Wave...OK?
They weren't kidding about these new immigration policies making waves.
Time for another 'Miracle on the Hudson'!
You know what they say, "Small hands, yuge wave."
The last view of liberty.
At least we're not without a paddle.
Guard your pussies
Look! We made the ocean great again!
None of the mainstream forecasts predicted this.
Give me your glitzy, your rich, your huddled asses yearning to be rich
I still say it's a toupee.
Yeah, but her emails...
We're sightseers. Not immigrants.
Stay away from the hands!
'I had the craziest nightmare! Donald Trump became President and people were trying to escape New York'
'Tired' is fine, but 'poor' is a deal breaker.
Ladies, guard your pussies!
Behold--the perfect tweetstorm!
Just admit that it's a foam-over.
Who's brilliant idea was it to comb over here?
Hang on tight! It's the wave of the future.
Relax, it's a Weave.
Despite what he says, the climate is changing.
O Large-Handed One, we are Russian billionaires!
What a blowhard.
Hold on, we're about to be hit by the orange tide.
Brace yourselves! We're about to be swamped by a tiny-handed metaphor with a bad foam-over!
I don't just blow hard—I'm a perfect storm.
What do you know, the hands ARE small!
Gee, his hands really ARE small.
We're going to need a huger boat.
Not to worry, the undertow is really small.
That wave looks like Alec Baldwin
The land of the free, and the home of the wave.
And straight ahead we have the terrible tide of bigotry.
We all remembered to bring our birth certificates, right?
Swamp the drain.
do you think he'll send the statue back also ?
'Just give me your Eastern European Supermodels"
Hair we go!!!
This must be the rogue wave that swept across America in November.
Welcome to America, our first stop will be your deportation interview.
Let's take this seriously, but not literally.
Well, I heard it'll lift all boats.
Anyone know how to part the waters?
But we are deplorables!!!
We were told there would be AMBER waves of GRAIN!
Sorry, no way to make this funny.
Are you the ghost of America Yet to Come?
10 percent chance the Times said.
Shutting down Fifth Avenue wasn't enough, eh?
Not as scary as his Twitter account.
I was hoping it was all a fake news story.
He'd better keep all his hands off my deck!
Is anyone else experiencing a Great Wave of anxiety?
I can't say the kind of storm this is, but you're all thinking it.
It's not those little hands I'm worried about.
It's the new administration's welcome to Ellis Island.
[No Caption Required!]
No, it's natural.
It's going to be Yuge!
You're right, Mavis, they *are* small.
We're hoping it's not a permanent wave.
I'm tired of politics, let's talk about the weather.
Sure it's scary but look at those tiny hands!
He's fit to be tide.
I told you to bring enough supplies for 4 years.
Look! He's distracted by that shapely statue in the harbor. We're saved!
It's a big wave. The biggest, believe me. It'll crash down so fast your head will spin. Sad.
If you just roll with it, you'll be alt right.
"This tsunami started on an escalator in a tacky hotel".
I've never seen an orange wave before...
Don't worry, we're from Slovenia.
That big wave behind it looks like Putin!
Now I get why the masses huddled.
Okay, ladies--batten down your hatches!
Don't worry, it is a hoax!
It's not too late! Reverse bigly!
Oh swell no.
--Then he made the ocean pay for it!
"If we can make it here, we'll make it anywhere"!
It's not due to climate change, it's extreme vetting.
I told you he was wet behind the ears.
The wave of the future?
Is this what they mean by extreme wetting?
Is it just me, or does that wave have a comb over?
Oh my! It's the dreaded maelstrump!
Relax, we're from New Jersey!
I didn't realize my two greatest fears were the same thing
But we are trying to go back to where we came from... New Jersey.
I told you we couldn't escape the election results.
But we're only going to Staten Island!
I don't know, let's see what he does
The rain of Donald Trump.
Trump wavers on his immigration policy.
Oh, it's only The Donald making waves again.
Give me your fired, your poorly tanned, your befuddled masses..
We're going to need a bigger selfie stick.
Hold on to your wallets
Aim for the mouth.
Wow, it's a Populist Wave, hampered by small hands.
Small hands, no worries, trust me.
No need to panic. We get one of these storms every four years.
He thinks we're immigrants.
It's OK; we're going, not coming.
I'm not going to dignify this cartoon with a caption.
I still don't believe its real.
Talk about thin skinned. All I said was the statue wasn't a 10!
Looks like a wave of nationalism.
Anyone here tired, hungry or poor?
Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses... gimme, gimme, gimme...
You guys think we should've just flown to Canada?
See that chick over there? Totally splashed her.
Oh golly, Trump l'oeil!
I thought El Niño would have bigger hands.
If this isn't proof of climate change I don't know what is.
Women, prepare to be groped by the tiny, watery hands of the wave of the future.
How'd he get Mexico to pay for that?
So much for being tired, poor, and huddled.
Hang on. By tomorrow it will be just a swamp.
Straight ahead is an example of overwhelming hyperbole overstating irony.
We're NOT in the same boat, it seems.
The good news is that it'll all be over in a New York minute.
Ah! The Great Weave!
Sure has small hands for such a big wave.
Stop tweeting and keep rowing!
This must be the new Trump immigration policy.
Look alive, ladies! Those aren't waves--they're locker-room hands!
Wow, he really does have small hands!
Row faster, it's only 2,000 miles until we reach Cuba!
All women 19 to 50, below deck immediately!
Is THIS the crime wave they told us about?
Watch the water, but fear the hands.
They won't have waves like this in Canada.
Hold on tight, everyone. It's gonna move on us like a bitch.
These new barriers to immigration are YUGE!
It appears that our new President-elect has decided to take immigration matters into his own hands.
It's okay. We're New Yorkers. We're trying to get out of the country.
The New Yorker is subverting its own caption contest by providing a cartoon that is, itself, a standalone allegory.
The deluge is going to be huge, believe me!
We call it a killer comb over.
This wave trumps them all.
It looks like red tide to me
Okay! Okay! We'll change it to, "the land of the free and the home of the wave."
Do any of you have experience building a wall?
Mexico isn't paying for this, either.
I think it's called a Trumpnami.....
I bet the epicenter was in Russia.
The hair. The small hands. Tell me you don't see it, too.
Whoa! Guess we shouldn't have ignored the hairricane warnings.
It's the dreaded American comb-over wave!
Coming into view next is the Mouth of the Hudson.
Ladies, prepare your flotation chastity devices!
It's okay, we're white.
Making the sea great again?
Nothing says New York like jazz hands!
Cover your "wherevers".
Yes! It is the BIGGEST wave. It's Y-U-G-E!
It's the wave of populism!
The one with the big tits can stay, the rest of you paddle back -you're disgusting!
"...And we end our tour with The Big Eastern Border Wave. Careful, ladies... it's a bit 'gropey' today.
What did he call us? A ship of what?
Brace yourselves, it's an American en(tidal)ment wave!
Don't worry, the Times says there's only a 10% chance of it breaking
If you're feeling a bit queasy, try focusing on the horizon.
I thought he only claimed to walk on water.
It did say wail watching - I just thought it was a typo
Keep paddling. The Trump wave of anti-immigrant hysteria is just metaphorical.
Throw out a pussy, that'll distract it!
This too shall pass. Just like the Black Plague.
Send back your immigrants, your tired, your hungry and your poor.
Maybe it won't be so bad.
Row faster, Hillary.
Oh no. PoseiDon.
GIVE ME LIBERTY or GIVE ME DEPTH
Remember: I voted to take the ferry.
Hold on, our only hope is to ride this one out!
Don't worry. It's just populist posturing.
No worries, it's only El Ninconpoopo
We were warned about a wave of fascism engulfing our country.
Don't worry. Nate Silver said the weather would be fine today.
He sure makes a big splash for having such tiny hands!
Who has a H-1B temporary fashion model visa handy?
Let's wait four years, then try again."
This wasn't in the forecast.
and to think it just started as a ripple....
It's the Trump effect.
This—this wasn't in the forecast.
It certainly does take the threat of freak storm to a whole new level.
Even up close his hands are tiny.
Don't worry. No one takes him literally.
Talk about a rogue wave.
We shouldn't have turned right after that nice black guy.
It's going to grab us by the poop deck.
You can't scare us. We are legal immigrants.
Global climate change never looked so ugly.
Look at those small hands!
He does have little hands!
Go home you tired, you poor, you huddled masses yearning to breathe free.
Nothing to worry about. It's just a wave over
The election results continue to wash over New York City.
Huddled masses! What were we thinking? Give us your models and billionaires.
"mirar las pequeñas manos!" ("Look at the tiny hands!")
Sosueme!
'And, to our right, Lady Liberty."
Now I'm not sure if the nausea is from the sea sickness.
A sea change in America
And ahead, folks there's the new monster in the swamp.
Maybe it wasn't so bad back home.
Get ready for some extreme wetting.
Intelligence reports tell us--and we can only hope--that this squall is just a lot of hot air.
They say it's a populist tidal wave, but you can't trust the media.
He never mentioned anything about building a wave!
Relax. He's selling water vests.
The forecast said threats of Trump l'oeil.
Up close it does look a little worse than the last one
That wave sure looks Bigly
Yo! It's time we begin to think outside the boat.
For Gods sake , where's the EZ PASS ?
And so it begins.
It's a tso-sue-me!
The Old Man-Elect and the Sea
Look out...it's the Great Weave!
This is the result when you combine the new climate change policy with the new immigration plan.
Okay masses, start huddling!
I thought he was only building a wall!
Hold on tight - we might get swamped by a huge metaphor!
If we can make it through there, we'll make it anywhere
Oh no! We're stuck in a hackneyed political cartoon about Donald Trump!
Does anyone else smell tic tacs?
Who knew coming to America could be so hairy!
Don’t worry, the pundits said don’t take him seriously.
All in favor of waiting this out back on the island?
It's not the size of the wave that frightens me...it's all of those little hands.
It looks really bad, but we are hoping it will just blow over.
The crest appears to be receding.
Hurricane Donald about to make landfall
There's got to be a "little dingy" joke here somewhere...anyone?
Fuck.
Does anyone know the difference between a typhoon and a tycoon?
Wow, that wave is bigly!
Forget the Lady. I'm in charge now.
Did we come at a bad time?
Mexico gets a wall. Manhattan gets a Trum-phoon.
Thank goodness it's a populist wave!
How did we wind up in the New Yorker Capsize Contest?”
We've been Trumped!
We Should Have Voted
Don't worry - it might grab but it won't get you wet.
Don't worry folks--unless you're poor, a member of the huddled masses, or yearning to be free--he won't hurt you.
Quick, huddle into a mass!
My my, what small hands you have.
The tides have changed and they have small hands.
Let's make the ocean great again !
Well, look who's come to drain the swamp!
¡Muchas manos - todas pequeñas!
"Do you still think the Circle Line Tour was too expensive?".
"Don't worry kids, he moves to D.C. next month".
Still, it's heartening to know he lost the popular vote.
I will build a seawall, and Atlantis will pay for it.
On second thought, the orange water should have been warning enough.
I thought you said we'd be greeted by trumpets!
Maybe we should have taken a train to Canada!
I know I've said Trump is overexposed, but I'm starting to see him everywhere now.
My god! A hair wave.
Even as a tidal wave he has short fingers.
Avec moi le déluge.
All we need now is Charlton Heston.
Notice the very small hands.
Now even Neptune is on the take
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily -- if only this were a dream.
I think it said, "Bring me. You're fired, you're poor, you're huddled masses..."
OMG a #twitterstorm
Is that a rogue wave, or is the tide really turning?
Hey, its not the 20th yet!
Wave goodbye to freedom
Losers!
We need to wait for this comb-over to blow over.
That's one hell of a permanent wave.
Just our luck...he's making the wave great again!
Did he say come-over or comb-over?
No worries, this comb over will blow over. .
It's the uncharted waters we've been hearing about!
I hope this isn't some kind of visual metaphor.
Deploy the liberal media!
It's gonna be huge.
This is what you call an Imperfect Storm.
Where's Sully when you need him?
The tides, they are a-changin'...
It's called a rogue wave.
Losers!
"If we can make it here, we'll make it anywhere"!
Abandon ship, Ladies. It's a Donald Wave looming over us for a group grope!
Don't worry. He is only dangerous if you smell a Tic Tac.
All of the sudden New Jersey don't seem so bad.
Welcome to Trump's America . we now have an extreme wetting process
Please Sir, there are no Mexicans or Muslims aboard.
The big wave grabs your attention, while the little ones ... .
Look, that wave is going to gently embrace us and move us forward.
In hindsight we should have seen this coming.
I'm sure it won't be so bad once it hits.
OMG! This is going to be yuuuuge. We may not survive. So sad.
He's mad he lost New York.
I'd still take this over what's happening on land.
Selfie time!
We should have taken the land route to Canada.
Brace yourselves for a sea change!
Quick! Throw the Muslims overboard.
I was warned about a big bag of wind.
Climate Change
I told you, small hands.
"What's this? Wasn't he just going to build a wall?
Brace yourself for this next comb over!
It's going to be hell AND high water, but we'll get through this.
On second thought, let's go back were we came from.
Let's give it a chance.
It's not bad enough he is all over the AIR waves.
But Vladimir sent us!
It won't hit us, I voted for it.
Look on the bright side, he said he'd make surfing great again.
But we're immigrants from New Jersey.
Look out...it's the Great Weave!
And here we have a striking example of Trump l'oeil.
'I thought Trump said, "...a wall."'
It's the rogue wave. Protect your privates.
You should have seen what all those hands did to Lady Liberty last November.
We should have acted sooner when when we saw the water turned orange.
Don't worry. He lies like a rug.
Yes, I know folks, we have to thank our best experts for not seeing this one coming.
Please tell me we're all in the same nightmare.
Small hands, but a big under tow
Does everything in this town have a comb-over?
Argh! They warned us Trump was the wave of the future.
I thought this was about "huddled masses", not "muddled asses".
I thought he said he was going to drain the swamp.
Don't worry folks. This tweet storm shall pass soon.
Just keep the bow pointed into the tantrum!
Just riding the weave...
I think we're gonna need a bigger boat...
I thought it was, 'give me liberty OR give me death.'
Hang on tight! We've got four years of this.
Looks like we're going to need a bigger boat.
But we're tired, we're poor!
Don't panic. Small hands. All tweet ... no threat.
Is this what they mean by climate change?
Why'd he sink the ferry? He carried Staten Island!
Now over here on your far right is the infamous Trump Twitter Tsunami...
Give me your tired, your poor....never mind.
Let's go back to Syria.
I thought he was just going to build the wall.
The press are already calling it Trump's Watergate.
It's not as bad as it looks. Right?
"I guess it's protecting Ellis Island from immigrants, huh?
Get down! Deadly comb-over to the starboard.
On your right is the Statue of Liberty. Directly before you is what used to be the United Nations.
Tiny hands! Lookout!
Stop yelling "all hands on deck"!
I didn't elect this either but we'll just have to ride it out
It really is huge!
Abandon ship! Every woman for herself!
It's definitely headed toward Wall Street.
I thought storm Donald wasn't due until the 20th!!
Not worried about the hair, but the big mouth and small hands are scary.
Don't worry. It's not a wave. Just a big gust of wind.
Why do I see a comb-over in everything I look at nowadays?
On second thought, let's go back.
The President-Elect welcomes you to the United States.
Populist wave!
Merely the storm before the calm.
I guess we underestimated the changing tides again.
Hold on -- it's a great white wail!
Give me your racist and your ill-read masses
And here we have the Great White Wave.
Entitled wave!
The Hugely Imperfect Storm
When you’re a wave, they let you do it. You can do anything.
He's more scared of us than we are of him.
I will build a seawall...You will pay
Stow the oars and ready the hairspray!
Wow, so this is what they mean by 'life imitating art'.
Don't worry, it'll blow itself out in two years!
A wave with a comb-over . . . only in America.
Guard your booty!
If you think this looks scary, you should read his twitter.
Who is going to pay for the wave?
Oh thanks, we know, we were actually just leaving.
I don't care what she says, go back!
He acts like he won the popular vote.
The wave is huge . . . but look at those tiny hands!
Let's go back and try the wall again.
"Here be orange-haired dragons".
You women in the boat??? --Careful!-- this one's a grabber!
If you're legal, relax.
It's true, Trump towers!
I think we should just let it crash into us and see what happens.
Every man for himself! And, ladies, guard your vaginas!
Well, maybe not Australia but how hard can it be to row to Canada?
We better turn back, gang. This storm's gonna be Yuuuuge!
OK, we're leaving, we're leaving!
The president is up early today.
Comb! Who's got the comb!?
YOU did not vote for me ! SO SAD...
But they're Russian refugees!
Oh no, a rogue comb-over, we're doomed !
So many tiny hands! Quick, everybody - cover your privates! You too, Miss Liberty!
I never trusted the popular boat.
I thought he moved to Washington
Did we bring enough supplies to last us four years?
We'll be ok if we can just stay away from the little groping hands.
It's a sue-nami!
You are supposed to build a wall, not a breakwater!
Tropical depression? Just one more stage to acceptance.
We were just leaving!
First the wall, now this?
Claims he's got the whole world in his hands.
That wave is yuuuuuge.
We're going to need a huger boat.
Hair today, gone tomorrow.
Watch your pockets, people!
Let's bail.
Should we take this literally or seriously?
We are the ghosts of immigrants past.
It Came from Queens
There must be an easier way to get to Jersey.
Hold on tight. We're entering the mouth of the Donald.
Wow. I wasn’t taking ’a sea change’ so literally.
i think the small hands make it less intimidating...
Ok, ok it was a landslide, not a tsunami!
Drain the harbor!
I said we're from East Palestine, OHIO!
It's the new welcome mat for immigrants.
I thought you said he was building a wall.
Holy guacamole, I didn't know he was going to build a wave, too.
Wow, an orange tsunami!
Ladies and gentlemen, not to worry. This is how he always looks after seeing one of Alec Baldwins SNL skits!
Please fasten your chastity belts
Look, our first celebrity sighting!
Wave goodby!
What's the likelihood of us getting a bailout?
Feeling a bit more tired, poor, homeless, huddled, and tempest-tossed than usual these days.
Somehow it's always the comb-over in the wind that's the scariest.
Try to avoid the tiny hands!
Ladies, get ready to be groped.
Cover up ladies.
Going with the flow just got a lot more difficult.
This still beats what's happening on land.
Hairicane Donnie nears the coast.
I get the feeling immigrants are not really welcome in this country any more.
You hired us, remember!?
I guess we know how Hillary felt on election night.
Nobody panic! Fivethirtyeight still has Hillary up by three.
I'm fired? That's all you've got?
That thing can drown our hopes and dreams..hang on!
Anyone else see another opportunity for the New Yorker to take a dig at Trump?
Look at all those little hands !
Is that a toupee?
Any chance that one of you lovely ladies is a virgin?
They said he would have turned back Noah's Ark.
Small hands, big toupee.
....and no trip to New York would be complete without a sighting of the President Elect.
Snap a picture !
It's a real pussy-grabber
Who knew he also built a wall of water!
Look at those tiny hands!
Last stop on the Victory Tour, folks.
Don't fret folks. He's assured us climate change is nothing to worry about.
This is not the time to lean too far Left or Right.
I told you we should have waited until xenophobia was at low tide.
Don't blame me - I voted for Hillary!
Cover your p_ _ _ys!
See, ladies and gentlemen, we call this a wave over, a beautiful wave over.
Brace for heavy petting.
Here at our sea-washed gates stands A mighty blowhard with tiny hands.
It's OK. He's making us great again.
This one, he got Dali to pay for.
Sure, the wave of anti-immigrant sentiment is huge, but look how tiny its hands are.
At least it's not Hilary!
Sorry, Pussy's on the next boat
It's part of the new anti immigration policy.
So this is what he meant by extreme wetting.
What do you expect? It's Jersey.
Now we want only your rested, your rich, your comfortable elite yearning to breathe free.
I thought a fence to keep out immigrants was ridiculous, but this is too much!
America has the best waves. No waves are better.
I lift my lamp beside the golden boor.
Hold on tight! We're about to be in for a Trumpy ride!
We're entering an oxymoron.
Don't let its small whitewater hands deceive you. This wave is unpresidented.
Donnie Tsunami
Give me your fears, your prejudices and your huddled minds...
POTUS, float us!
I never thought I would be drowned by a comb over.
No, Canada is the other way.
What an unpresidented, bigly wave!
I think we should have taken the Circle Line
Hang on. Let's give this wave a chance.
I knew they were small, but why so many?
Oh no! it's the great weave!!
No, give ME your tired, your poor, your hungry...
Here we go with the extreme vetting
"So this is 'extreme vetting'!
Forget about free. In a couple of seconds we're gonna be yearning just to breathe.
Wow! A tidal wave from a shitstorm.
Sure it looks bad, but let's give it a chance.
See? This is why I stopped coming to Staten Island.
Sorry guys, I guess he built a 'sea wall,' too.
Hold on everyone, lets give the tsunami a chance.
Like I told you, America welcomes refugees with open arms.
Ignore the sound and fury but watch out for its hands.
Go home! Pay no attention to that woman across the water! The Great Comb-Over has spoken!
First Putin, now Poseidon!?
No no, we're LEAVING.....and you can keep our jobs.
I wish he really had drained the swamp.
Wake me when it's over.
America 2017: The New Wave
It's one of those New York swells I read about!
Hold on tight. Huuge climate change straight ahead!
Something is telling me this isn't going to end well.
It's been doing this ever since we took Trump Tower off the guided tour.
I guess we'll have to yearn to breathe free someplace else.
Wave goodbye everybody!
I still think we should have waited for Christie to reopen the George Washington Bridge!
so this is how Hillary felt during the compaign.
California, here we come!
I didn't think it would be a water wall.
I lift my lamp beside the golden boor.
On your right is the Statue of Liberty.
What changed? We're huddled and yearning.
They call it El Blanco.
He's trying to brand the ocean!
What's that tweeting noise?
Make salt water great again!
It's "give me your masses" not misses.
Steady now. He alone will save us.
He made the wave great again.
Are we sure Canada is full?
It was the perfect storm.
Let's just wait and see if he's all talk.
Was he saying vetting or wetting?
I'm scared. Let's row back to Syria.
Just remember, it's more afraid of you than you are of it.
Hurry, huddle your masses!
It is that orange hair monster with small hands. Speaking Russian.
That hair looks all too familiar. Ladies, cover your laps.
Quick! Drop the anchor babies!
So, is that the wretched refuse of their teeming shore?
It's the populist wave that was rejected by New York.
This wave is not 'unpresidented'...
Don't be afraid, he just wants to make us great again!
Hold tight as we enter the mouth of lies.
Who knew waves could be orange?
Wow, the little hands, too.
9/11 a liberty threat; 11/9 a comb-over regret.
I've decided to take him literarily, but not seriously.
Tremendous wave, tiny hands - It's the Tsunami-Elect!
Trump-nami!
Is this what they meant by Trumped up trickle down?
Welcome to 2017!
What little hands for such a bigly wave!
Ha, ha! We all know not to take him seriously! Don't we...........................
'According to the polls there's no way the trump wave will crash into us...I'm sure we'll be just fine'
It's called the new wave of politics.
Man, that wave is yuge.
Did we decide on Canada or Cuba?
Looks like getting out of the US will be as hard as getting in from now on.
REVERSE! We need to rethink this!
Don't worry, Lady Liberty has weathered more than this...
I think it's another Chinese hoax.
Tiny hands. We know what that means.
Here we have our new face of government
Anyone here named Hilary?
No worries. Some scientists say that is a small wave and this is a big boat. Believe me.
Brace yourselves: Angry white squall!
So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past. Sad!
Hold on. I need to tweet about this!
We're getting mixed messages here.
The last Thanksgiving.
We're not going back unless we get a really good deal!
Gimme, you muddled asses!
Uh, oh! I think this is what they meant by "extreme vetting."
Try to look beyond the obvious.
It's true. He does have small hands.
And this concludes the optimists' rowing club tour.
Such tiny hands!
This area is famous for its yuge and terrifying weaves!
It's the wave of the future.
The other ninety percent of it is hidden under water.
What do we have to lose?
You're angry? We're heading for Canada.
That can't be real foam!
Wow, the bluster has turned gale-force.
Small hands, but Great Wave!
Oh my god it's the dread Trump Tidal Hair!
Alright, we've got seven people and five lifejackets. Will all climate change deniers please raise your hands.
Grab 'em by the dingey.
This wave is bigly….REAL bigly!
Come on--let's give it a chance!
Hang on -- it looks like the dreaded Orange Tide is headed our way.
Don't worry - he can't win.
Huddle up, things are about to get hairy.
See, I told you he was all wet.
I saw the exact same wave in West Palm Beach!
Beware the Trumpnami!
That hair...Oh my God, it's him!
Now, do you believe in climate change?
Wave back, everyone!
We thought it was fake news!
A wall of water? This guy is serious.
Land of the free-for-all
This'll be great. Just wait and see.
I thought the wall was in Texas.
Onward! It's just an old rug on an oil slick.
Avoid eye contact.
We'll be back in four years.
Don't worry, it's just another Chinese hoax.
Big,BIG hands!!!
Passports?
The sea was very grabby that day.
...and if you look to your right, you'll see Lady Liberty...
Oh no, it's a Trumpnami !"
Keep ajar the golden door oh mighty molded pompadour.
Heeeere's Donnie!
Looks like Orange is the new Blue.
Nothing funny about this!
Deb, I told you that pot was a lot stronger today than when we were in college!
I told you we should have just waited for the next Staten Island ferry.
Just as he predicted, it's HUGE!
If we make it through this, we really are great again.
Who said I wouldn't know a rogue wave if I saw one right in front of me?
Looks like this tired, poor, huddled mass won't be breathing free anytime soon.
Welcome to America
I just knew Canada by boat would be a bad idea.
Yep. The hands really are tiny.
It wants to see our ID's.
Wait! We're just passing by on our way to Canada!
Wave back, you idiots!
Oh my! the tsunamis from November 8th has arrived
Maybe it's waving goodbye
The tired, the poor and the huddled masses are in the boat to your left.
But we're not terrorists or wretched refuse. We're fit, rich, and coddled classes learning to freeze brie."
Ever since the debunking of global warming, the waves seem huge! HUGE!
Am I the huuuuugest wave you've ever seen?" "Am I the huuuuuuugest wave you've ever seen?
Big hair, big mouth, small hands SCARY
Don't worry, folks, it'll blow itself out!
But we're huddled masses.
That's the dumbest looking wave I've ever seen.
We are documented and LEAVING - Let us pass!
Ladies and Gentlemen,- - -a bit premature---this wasn't supposed to happen until January 20, 2017.
With hair like that how dangerous can it be?
And that's the president. You'll get used to him.
The experts only gave Hurricane Donald a 20% chance of making landfall.
Tell him he has great hair.
They're not sending us their best people! Some are tired, some are poor, some are just huddled masses. Sad! #he-who-must-not-be named-on-buildings
Fear not people; just a simple blowhard.
Remember to take it seriously, not literally
This must be the tidal wave that struck America.
Uh-oh, let's catch the next wave.
Yoo-hoo...huddled masses! Pay no attention to the man behind the wave!
Here comes the latest threat to our life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
This is where we get combed over
Maybe now he'll liquidate his assets.
He really DOES have small hands.
Is it possible to drown in a comb-over?
We're never buying another Groupon tour!
Co-opted iconic symbology everywhere, and not a drop to drink
Okay ladies, guard your pu$$ies!
November 9th, 2016.
Believe me! This is going be a total disaster!
Row everyone,...Row; we don't want to get caught in that "Comb-Over"!
He said he would make waves great again.
I think, maybe, we are not welcome!
Now THAT'S a comb-over!
Donald, calm down. We know you won.
The hands, so tiny, how much damage can they cause?
Hold tight, our only hope is to ride this one out!
Welcome! Now get out
Clearly we've crossed over to the Jersey side.
I guess it's time to show your green card Juan
Donald Trump? Wave goodbye, everybody.
I'm sure it will calm down after the inauguration.
Oh great, he can control water now!
Whoa! Looks like the swamp is coming here.
The secret password is "comb-over".
As you can see, climate change is a myth.
And I thought the wall idea was bad.
Land of the free, home of the wave....
We should have tried the wall.
I'm mostly just so distracted by those tiny hands.
A rising tide swamps all boats.
Relax, we're smuggling beauty queens.
I think we should have stayed in the swamp.
Don't worry, folks. Your pre-existing conditions are still covered.
Wow, the Wave of Revulsion appearing during a Storm of Controversy.
So much for huddled masses yearning to be free....
Making America swell again is starting to look violent
We should have expected this.
Yes, he has taken us by storm.
If we all row really fast we can get out of here by Inauguration Day.
Look! Donald is making waves already!
Wave, everybody!
Stroke! It's the big ugly wave of populism!
Pay no attention to that lady behind the curtain
Winslow Homer's: The Fraud Warning.
"Give me your tired, your poor"… yeah, right... get outta here!
Maybe it'll pivot.
I feel it: "Make the Ocean Great Again!"
This too shall pass!
No, wait...it's receding!! Must have thought we were going to hold a press conference.
Don't take it literally.
If we weren't facing imminent doom, I'd almost think it was funny.....
The sea is angry today.
Oh boy! It's telling us things are going to be fantastic!
But we are giving you our tired, our poor and our huddled masses.
Let's just wait and see if it goes away in four years.
I think we can avoid this if we head north
The Wave of Tyranny!
Is this what you call "wait and sea"?
This is unprecedented.
I thought we would make it before Trump became President.
Your tiny hands are no match for our diversity!
And over here we have the inevitable wave of hate crimes.
Is it my imagination or is this what the next four years will really look like?
My nausea comes in waves.
This is the last time I rely on CNN's hurricane tracking poll.
Global warming!
Nothing to worry about--he's all show. Believe me.
And this is where global warming submerged Ellis Island.
Don't blame me, I voted for Clinton.
I've heard of Red Tide, but this looks more orange to me!
Those idiots said that hurricane Trump wasn't going to develop!
This is why you signed waivers, people.
We’re gonna need a bigger boat.
I didn't see this coming!
That wall sounds pretty good right about now.
Relax, its only Trump L'oeil!
It's so bigly!
Wow... Look at those tiny little hands
Look to your right and you'll be able to catch a brief glimpse of Lady Liberty.
I guess he really is a force of nature.
As we feared, this is a result of the seismic convergence of politics and climate change denial.
Don't worry, he's got small wavelets.
So is it us or him that's going against the tide?
Attack of the Great White Groper!
Hang on tight, this one's bigly.
Who wants to try Canada?
And over here we have a monstrous Trump weave!
Ask him how to get to Carnegie Hall.
I THOUGHT YOU SAID HE WANTS TO DRAIN SWAMPS!?
I've never seen a wave with such tiny hands before.
And as we approach January 20, 2017, we have a small craft advisory warning throughout the East Coast.
Relax Marge, it's just a lot of bluster. It'll blow over.
This must be a sea wall that Trump has built to keep us out!
We were just on our way to Canada, Mr. Trump
Dramamine, anyone?
okay everyone, brace for 4 year impact!
If life is but a dream, I would like to wake up now.
Shalom!
I had no idea that waves could be orange.
This isn't exactly what I pictured when he said a 'wall'.
Anyone got a green card?
Oh, no! Trump Tower sewer has sprung a leak.
Moby Trump!
Why did we decide against landing in Canada?
He also managed a hostile takeover of the Hudson River.
"That wave is huuuuge. Tremendous wave, believe me".
Calm down! That lady with a torch invited us!
Everybody call it "The Great Wave", nobody mention the little hands.
Did he tweet about this?
Moses! Get your red staff out and let God part his comb over, so we can cross to freedom!
He's ready for the new wave of immigrants.
This is what you get when squall line meets hairline.
These must be the so-called 'amber waves of grain'.
Look out - those tiny hands aren't just for waving.
It'll never happen, this is all just a joke.
Oh great, he's franchising weather now.
His immigration policy is even scarier than I thought!
We should have built a larger vessel for at least 1,460 days and nights of reign.
I thought New York was a sanctuary city!
We're not immigrants, we're tourist!
Hope overcome by a wave of discontent.
Swim for Liberty Island! What the hell have you got to lose?
Let's just give it a chance -- it may pass
What's really scary is that bad comb over.
Looks like we're in for a Don-easter folks!
Watch out, ladies, he's got lots of hands.
Look at those hands, they really are small!
I recognize those small hands and comb over anywhere.
The hands really are quite small.
Let us pass, Mr. Trump. We're refugees from America.
It's trying to make America wet again.
It's what I've been saying all year long...."Yikes! this can't be happening!'
In terms of storms this one looks like a loser. Sad.
A dam might have been more useful than that wall.
Wow, yes, exactly like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli.
Well, 'the huddled masses' are about to be 'tempest tossed'!
It looks like we're going to have a bad hair day
That's the second scariest comb-over I've ever seen.
Get ready for the ride of your life.
This is our wave of the future!
Relax, my shrink says post-election comb over hallucinations are normal.
Just remember that it's only a hoax create by China
Extreme vetting!
Sorry, Trumpie, sanctuary city.
Clearly its form over substance
Well, if this doesn't Trump all!
Quick! Say the magic words: "Radical Islamic Terrorism."
You keep comparing it to Hitler, but I don't think it looks anything like Hitler.
Mary, look how small his hands are!
It's not an effect of global warming - but it'll probably be another cause.
Inaugural poster considered for new immigration policy.
Warning Ladies...guard your pussies!
I've never seen an orange and yellow wave before.
Not your normal wave, it's what we call a comb-over.
No thanks Mr. Trump. We're headin' for Cuba.
Uh, I think we may headed in the wrong direction.
Let's make America bait again!
The mouth that roared
The hair is the least of it.
Don't worry, it's the wave of the future.
The Perverted Storm
Quick! Let's huddle our masses.
These happen every 16 years or so.
So this is the new immigration policy I've been hearing about.
"...Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free...The wretched refuse of your teeming shore...Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door." NOT!
Quick! Denounce Hillary!
It's a Trumphoon!!!
As for you poor and tired huddled masses, "Fagettaboutit!"
I guess we were too tired, too poor, and too homeless!
Who called me Ishmael?
I'm more concerned with the tiny hands.
You are right Jane, Trump World is a scary ride!
The sea was angry that day, my friends.
Despite the terrific rain of half-truths and tremendous flood of reckless lies, the scientists bravely clung to their facts.
Let's hope it blows over without too much damage.
Trying to escape Trump is going to be harder than I thought.
Is it just me, or does that sea monster have really small hands?
As if the wall weren't enough...
Don't think this Trump-nami will blow over anytime soon.
Don't worry, it's just a big weave.
Don't worry. He doesn't have a mandate.
Uh oh. Who brought the sacrificial virgins?
Let's bail.
You think this was the wall he had in mind?
That's not a big wave. It's a combover.
This is our final stop. Now shake hands with your greatest fear.
I'm more worried about the rogue pompadour.
Looks like a bad wave day!
But we are tired, poor and huddled!
The wave is terrific! But we're still voting for Hillary.
Waves of fear are everywhere in these tides of change.
Making sea-level rise great again.
But we're tired, poor and a huddled mass yearning to be free.
I told you not to trust the polls!
I'm not really getting that "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses" vibe.
Quick, set the GPS for Havana!
It's blowing hard today .
From every ocean wide, let freedom sink!
We should wait and see, give this wave a chance.
Yes, 'grab them by the dinghy' is a good immigration slogan for you.
Do you think that this is a welcoming or a groping?
No worries, only attacks immigrants!
Everyone! Cheer wildly and show no fear, he's desperate for our approval.
Courage! We will over comb if we just keep rowing.
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a...what?!
Oh swell no.
Did anyone even bother to read the reviews before booking this trip?
Just hold your breathe; it'll be gone in about four years.
What have we got to lose?
Just stay calm, we've been in business since 1776
Oh, but look at those adorable tiny hands!
Is that a wig?
Uh oh! We're going to get drenched....bigly!
It just wants to tweet, hide your phones, folks!
Not to worry, the experts say that there's an 89% chance that it won't hit us.
Hang on for greatness.
I guess some combovers are worse than others.
Quick, fasten your wallets!
Looks like one of those 4-year storm cycles!
Oh NO! ... it's the Trump sea wall!
Let's keep rowing to Canada
No, we're the Brooklyn Rowing Club.
And to your right, you'll see the land of the free, home of the wave.
Donald Trump has definitely made it harder to get into the country!
Let's don't go to Jersey.
As our tour nears its end, I would like to thank you again for joining us on today's Ellis Island "Immigrant Experience" adventure.
Red rover, red rover, let no one comb over
She's confused. No tired, no poor, no huddled masses are allowed.
I thought he said he would only build a wall.
You know, he will make us pay for this!
Back off! Supermodels onboard!
But we're not illegal; we're only coming from Williamsburg!
Don't worry, it won't rock the boat until next month.
Beware the brazen giant with tiny hands, who extinguished the torch of the mighty woman!
This wave is going to grab us by the prow and do whatever it wants!
Maybe we should give it a chance..
Uh oh. I thought 'huge wave of disaster' was just a metaphor.
Looks like we have to pay the toll.
Anyone else feel like things have been stranger since the election?
No, there aren't any tired or poor aboard, just a huddled mass of hedge fund managers.
Tsunami Trump swamps the American dream
No, it's totally fine. He just likes to wave.
Quick, there's no time to lose: SELFIE positions!
Don't be scared. He's just pretending to be something he's not.
I can't even part my own hair. What makes you think I can part this sea?
Relax, ladies. I have enough small hands to grab all of you.
This must be the "life is but a dream" part.
Don't let my comb-over and small hands bother you. I love immigrants.
President-Elect Trump's welcome wave towards immigrants.
Who said "Give me liberty or give me death?"
Well, at least the wave is great again.
Let it wash over us, it'll be tremendous.
Nature imitates politics.
With that hair, and those tiny hands, it was the second scariest thing to happen in New York.
Make America Great Again. Go Home.
Don't give me your tired, your poor!
I vote to ride the wave...
Alex Baldwin, ladies and gentlemen.
...and this we received from China.
Even Lady Liberty flirted with me.
Women and children grab the life jacket! Everybody else, prepare to make America great again!
So tell me again why they didn't do something about climate change when they had the chance?
I'd say he was a nightmare, if we weren't all in the same boat.
He never said what would be great
No, he only tweets at low tide.
You were right; it was 'amber waves of pain.'
LEFT FULL RUDDER !
Now this wave takes credit for putting the "sue" in tsunami.
Don't worry. It can't grab us with those tiny hands.
Go on, pull it! It's real!
It's just hair.
Don't worry: it's just a splash over.
Sorry, no inauguration performers here, either.
Where you folks from?
Wow! The Trump Water Tower!
Maybe Canada wasn't the best idea
Thank goodness this is just a cartoon!
Rogue waves .... another phenomenon brought about by extreme climate change.
Don't worry--comb-over waves always fizzle out.
- On the bright side, it cannot possibly be as bad as it looks.
Hold on tight. Here comes an unprecedented YUGE wave!
He must have drained the swamp.
I think my fear of tsunamis and my fear of politics are starting to merge.
No worries ! It's just a new administration coming in.
How is this making America great again?
He's everywhere.
Wow-look at all those little finger waves!
Watch out for the Trumpnami!
Must be a tsunami from the earthquake in D. C.
His face looks more orange on television.
What do we have to lose?
Here on your right is New York's largest nocturnal swamp creature. Notice the large mouth which is used to make up for its tiny hands. If you listen closely, you can hear it calling us all losers.
The 2016 election results as foretold by a famous Chinese artist.

But we're from Slovenia!
Wave to Ms Liberty, Darling. It may be your last chance
He certainly is making America wet again.
No, Dramamine won't help.
And this is where our economy tour ends.
Haircules is upon us!
Forget the Trump wave—it's the tiny hands that should worry you.
Not so much a cruel sea as ironic.
Don't worry, we'll get by. He's not gonna mess up that hair.
I know he's draining the swamp, but isn't this going too far?
We should've waited after the impeachment.
Wave goodby!
It's a wall and waterboarding combo.
Help! It's a trumped up wave!
It must be the wave that swept Trump to the White House.
Oh no, another Chris Christie shenanigan!
What very nicely formed and astonishingly above average size hands you have!
Pat Robertson still blames this one on gays somehow.
I think it's more afraid of us than we are of him
Look how small those hands are.
Orange Crush
It's not just the sea that is angry these days, my friends.
Looks like an unfolding tragedy!
Don't worry. Tsunamis can't happen in America.

Small hands!!!
This is way cooler than a big wall.
Just a very bad dream, folks, which, trust me, you will wake up from in four years, I promise.
Oh no, it's the rogue wave!
Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses--but just the perfect 10's--yearning to be groped.
First it was the wall on the border with Mexico ,now this...
Yet another depiction of the impending Trump apocalypse.
Are we huddled masses yearning to breath free? Yes, but some, I assume, are good people.
I admit it looks bad, Vern, but just give it a chance.
I'm getting mixed messages.
Liberty or death?

This must be his East Coast version of "Build a Wall".
Don't Worry, no one respects boaters more than I do.
Look at those hands,it must be him.
is there any way this is metaphorical?
Of course, you're right. We'll wake up tomorrow morning and Hillary will be the next President.
And up ahead is the rarely seen wave-over.
It too scary here. Let's row back to Syria.
And we thought Super Storm Sandy was a disaster!
Small hands. Ha ha!

Tsunami? No. in New York we consider it a yuge monster wave.
Wall if by land, wall if by sea..
Let us Liberals go!

He calls it "vetting."
A rising tide lifts all boats, right?
That's A Bigly Wave!
Oh no! Not a beachcomb-over!
"It's called 'The Suenami'".
Wow! Even the Wall was created in his image.
Don't worry, it's just trompe l'œil.
You just had to call her "The Minnow"
A rising tide lifts all boats...I think.
I know eleven looks like a lot, but they are tiny!
First I'll take Manhattan, then I'll take . . .
140 characters won't get us out of this one! It will take another miracle on the Hudson.

Canada: Now accepting befuddled masses
Brace yourselves! Comb over waves will grope without warning!
Loose lips sink ships!
Don't criticize its hands and we'll be OK.

It's just a Chinese hoax.
We're looking for pre-2017 America.
Hurry, we must get back to Cuba!
Permission to drain the Trump, Sir.
I call it 'Trumped-up global warming'.

Prepare yourself for the deluge, folks!
I knew nature would have the upper hand!
First Trump wanted to keep people out, now he wants to keep people in?
Take back your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free ...
Welcome, to the land of Extreme Vetting. He, he, he.
"Is he trying to keep us out? Or is he trying to keep us in?

Trump's Immigration Poli-SEA
It's one thing to snarl traffic on the GWB but this is ridiculous!
Would you kindly point the way to Ellis Island?
We should have listened to the weather briefing.
Trump....you suck!
Someday, this will be a Hollywood movie. So why don't we sing a song as we're drowning?
Something tells me we're not in Kansas anymore
Si, we are U.S. citizen.
Look out! Its ignorance and intolerance!
On second thought, I don't think I'm THAT wretched.

Don't be an alarmist--give the wave a chance.
He even finds a way to take credit for bringing water back to America!
I see the orange curl!
It's just a comb over, no worry...
Give me your tired your poor, your -- Hey, hey, get the hell away from them!
Give me your terrified, your fool-hardy, yearning to capsize.
Don't worry, the size of the hands doesn't correlate with the size of the waves.
I wish he'd stay in Washington!
I say we let it drown us, it's the only way to start over!
I thought the tweet was about being tired, huddled, and yearning, but maybe that was only the Cabinet.
Please don't leave. It will be great!
Which way do we row to get to Ellis Island?
Now do you understand how he’ll fix our trade deals?
I thought he said a wall, not a wave!
Ice hole straight ahead!
This wave in particular was inspired by Donald Trump.

NO! I said look at all those BIG hands.

Don't worry, it is a hoax!
Amigos, it looks like we have a waiver.
AND I thought when coming to America the beautiful we'd see amber waves of grain...!
I see Voldemort. Or maybe Sauron. Who do you see?
We're the lucky ones.

I hear there are calmer waters further north!
Make the wave great!
Grab them by Nyuyoku ichi. Yu Kando Oni thing.
Who checked the tide table?

Compared to the Statue of Liberty's, I suppose they are.
You had to bid one NO Trump!
Look, he's waving to us
I swear, we're just coming from Statin Island.
Not to worry folks, these Trump Tsunamis are all hair.
Looks like they changed the part about "yearning to breathe free."
It's Donald!
Excuse me, which way to Ellis Island?
That hair - that face! It looks SO familiar!
Trump sends waves to drown illegals.
United, we can ride this out.
Bluster away - the climate has definitely changed!
Nice work on the yearning, everyone. Now, into huddled mass formation, quickly.
I can't tell which part I least want to fall on me.
In this depiction of America circa 2016, we see the world through the eyes of Donald J. Trump.
I didn't know a Wall of Water was one of his campaign promises.
It's virtual realty, keep rowing!
Rule the Donald, the Donald rule the waves!
Must be the Hairicane Donald's rogue wave we were warned about back on the dock!
It's a cartoon dream, obviously: three short fingers instead of four. Still, I really want to wake up.
Does anyone have bad hair colored crayons?
Watch out, it's The Donald hair tsunami!
Let's all doo the wave!!
When he promised the new border control would be beautiful AND effective, this isn't what we envisioned.
We came all this way only to be featured in a racist cartoon?
But the forecast said smooth sailing until 2017.
If we pull together, the storm will pass.
Anyone you know?
Hokusai, shumkusai, it still looks like him
These Trump-Tsunamis occur only when there is seismic activity around our electoral process.

It never even wanted to be a wave.
Looks like the last Trump storm of the year then the depressions moves to Washington
A wave of support for president Trump's proposed immigration reform evidences itself in New York City's harbor.
Just wave him off.
Hopeless, Lady Liberty can only stand and watch.
Give me your investment bankers. Your tired, poor and huddled masses? Not!
Merrily we row along...oblivious to our fate.
As we row sharply to the Left, nothing can possibly go wrong!
I actually prefer this nightmare.
Global warming has made the 'orange tide' ferocious this year...
Does anybody know what a killer wave looks like?!
This is what happens to Liberty with too many hair implants and too much testosterone.
That's just water, just like they're just words. Not gonna hurt us, folks.

That wave has far-reaching political significance for us.
Couldn't he have just tweeted about Hokusai !?
"Anyone here tire? Poor? Tempest tossed?
I'm demanding a refund--this tour sucks.
Trump's water wall? We're gonna pay!
And, finally, the newest feature of our tour: This bigly wave washes us all back to Ellis Island.
These are not the immigrants you are looking for
Where have I seen that comb over ...oh I know.
Donald?
He didn't say anything about a waterwall!
This phenomenon is obviously caused by feelings of inferiority.
Oh, no! It's a tidal wave with groping hands and a nightmarish political disaster, all wrapped in a comb-over.
The poor, huddled masses are tired of you.
Those hands are surprisingly big!
Maybe leaving because of the election results was a mistake.
I told you the "2016" ride was realistic.
This is the comb-over I was telling you about.
The waters surrounding the statue are not supposed to be so treacherous!
Put your hand in the hand of the man that stills the water...
Hopefully the calm comes after this storm.
Bye Bye, you Deplorables...
Another "Gropenami"!!!
That's a really hairy wave!
The comber's comb over was magnified by its tiny hands.
I told you there would be some surprises!
To the right, behold the Trump wave tower.
And that leads us to the Hurricane Sandy part of our tour.
Why is the lady so angry?
A Perfect Storm. Wait - didn't they all drown in the movie?
Avast, Ishmael, Big Hair High Up; Tiny Hands at the Bow. Hard to Starboard!
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream ...
It's okay, kids. You know what they say about waves with tiny, ineffectual hands.
Get ready huddled masses for this entitled wave.
Now that's what I call a trumped-up welcome wave.
Look, the Statue of Gibberish.
The wavelets look small, but they can really grab you.
I know, we were told!
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to ME, I'll throw them back into the sea!
We're still pretty sure her hands are bigger
Hang on! Its not the wave that will kill you, but the cabinet behind it.
Uch, another performance piece about the election.
does he think his new policy of scare tactics on immigration will work!
Wave or wall, what difference does it make.
Oh Crump!
'The shores of America are not as welcoming as we were led to believe."
Does that wave look like Donald Trump to anyone else?
Rain is the death of his do.
So this is what the new comb-over control approach to immigration reform looks like!
Only in New York, folks-a tsunami with a combover!
This is not my ocean!
Oh, I get it! It's a cartoon about Tru--
Gimme your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe my extreme vetting.
And this is the 'Great Seawall of America', dating back to the twenty first century.
Uh-oh! Here comes the "tempest-tost" part of the invitation!
I think we're about to be swamped.
Hair Ho!!!
Don't miss your chance to photograph the Swell Of Swill.
I love how climate change is trying to prove itself.
Then the Trumpmendous wave huffed and he puffed and blew the boat load of immigrates right out of the water and clear over the huge, tall wall.
They let him brand this water, too.
We're with Sully Sullenberger.
Now, if you look to your left....
Happy New Year World.
The 2017 Inauguration.
Up ahead is the President's new beach combover.
Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free... "Hey did anybody read the fine print?"
I don't care what that nasty woman said. You are not welcomed here.
Don't catch this wave.
FORGET freedom . . . we're about to be Trumped!
Oops! Too late. We've been intercepted by President Trump
Rogue wave ahead.
Trump could no longer deny the existence of climate "change".
Don't worry. It may look scary, but it couldn't possibly tip a boat like this...
No, son, the amber waves are actually amber.
Yes I agree the CIRCLE LINE would have been the better choice.
It's the Trump-ocalypse.
He's got it wrong! We're not chasing our jobs abroad; we're content to wander the seas for the next four years....
Everyone who bought travel insurance gets rescued.
And over here is New Jersey...
It's new for 2017. Our "Swirling Eddy of Despair".
No torch. No torch . She's waving bye bye. Except....Any super models?
And while the Statue of Liberty was a beacon of hope for new immigrants way back when; this is what new immigrants can expect!
Hard to trump this welcome.
Hurricane Trump! Let's hope it's not as scary as it looks!
Japanese art really does come alive at MOMA!

The inscription reads: 'Give me your wretched losers yearning to breathe free, and work for me for free, and then get em the hell outta here.'
And just off the prow here you'll see President Trump's more understated younger brother, Tsunami Trump.
You want to grab me by the WHAT?
Look out! We're about to be quaffed by the coiffed wave!
Cover your laps and hold your breath!
I told you global warming was a hoax. It's global waiving we have to worry about.
We are too strong for it to capsize us. But, ladies, be on the lookout for those tiny waving hands.
Is it too late to move inland?
Is the top of that really his crest?
We have our birth certificates and tax returns right here for your inspection.
Don't worry, that "Trump" wave will never last...
I asked for a sign!
Where's Hillary's Ark when you need it?
There's no escaping The Donald effect !
Not being on the same wavelength can be a good thing.
Now I understand why the masses required so much huddling!
And finaly,as a thank you for using Trump boats your, families will all be issued refunds.
...and finally the Towering Trump-nami.
I feel a hug coming on.
My God!! It's the Trump tsunami!!
What the fuck...!
I had hoped that we would avoid the 'tempest-tost' part.
Not climate change; climatic change!
Don't take it literally.
Oh, what a metaphor!
Honest, we have our immigration documents coming in the next boat.
lt's grabby and huge!
Why did we refuse the teeming shore?
(In the very, very near future) "I see the president's plan for immigration reform is now in effect."
Wow--look at that amazing comb over!
We're gonna need a bigger boat again.

Talk about making tidal waves great again...
I thought his hair was orange.
Relax! It's only one of our daily Trumpunamis blowing through.
I thought he promised a wall not a wave?
It's not really the motion of the ocean. Check out the tiny sea hands.

I told you trickle down was a bad idea.
Hurricane Donald!

Hey huddled masses, this must be the "tempest-tossed" part they told us about.
Oh great, another boatload of climate deniers.
They're not longer admitting the tired and the poor but maybe we can get in on the tempest tossed exception.
Looks like Super Storm Donnie.
Ok. Who was on tweet duty this morning?
Nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands.
The highlight of our tour, the meaner, scarier rogue waves due to climate change!!
I thought it was the other side of the country that had the wall to keep out immigrants.

It's the Trumpness monster here to save us.
Is it just me, or does the new wave need a haircut?
We're doomed - that wave has rolling eyes, a big mouth, octopus hands and a terrible combover!
But we're yearning to breathe free!
Don't look at him. It will only fuel his rage.
Guess I shouldn't have named the boat "The Ark".
Who knew Trump would watch out for immigrants personally?
Go back, you are making a yuge mistake...
I know it looks bad, but the rent is real cheap out here.
I thought he was moving to the White House.
Just close your eyes and say 'recount.'
I'll take Lonely Planet over New Wave anytime.
I knew Trump would morph into something like this!
It;s only a dream...Nightmare on 57th Street!
Don't worry folks, this tidal wave has very small hands and very bad hair.
He's trying to stop the immigrant wave.
That's your cue, Miss New Jersey.
Even you can't scare me. I choose lady liberty!
So tsunami...
Whoever said "nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands" was full of it!
We're trapped in a climate change nightmare.
Small hands and a combover. Nothing to worry about. Good for business.

The new weave of immigration
He's changing it to give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to eat steak and sell real estate.
So, who did you vote for?
He's taking this wall thing a bit far!
This new administration is emphasizing the tempest-tost requirement.
Keep rowing and ignore the loud tweets; we are almost Americans.
I've never seen such a socially backward wave.
Merrily, merrily ... Holy *#$! Wave! It's Donald!
Welcome to Ellis Island in 2017 folks.
Drain the swamp AND swamp the boat?
Tempest tossed, party of seven.
This wave sure trumps the last one!
This is "Making America Great Again"?
Cuba here we come!
Don't you just hate it when mother nature does the wave?
I thought we were approaching Japan
Looks like stormy weather.
Looks like we're being swamped!
Brace yourselves, it's a rogue wave with ambition!
Your mother is a wave?
Just sign the waiver, he said. What could possibly go wrong, he said.
The Donald doing the wave, his way.
Is this Cilla or Charybdis?
I do not care what you say, I have a good feeling about this
Ever since secession of the four other boroughs, the headwaters of Staten Island have been like this.
Frightened, just another wave of Trump tweets.
Guys with big hair and tiny hands often have an evil twin.
Oohh, there's the Statue of Liberty, everyone!! Waaave!!!
Sorry, our bad. We're looking for Ellis Island, not Staten Island.
The tidal waves. The sushi.... I love New York!
Wave goodbye! -Or- Hair you go!
They lied, this is no hoax.
Be honest - is my hair too wavy?
I told you it was a combover!
This wave of change is no friend of Lady Liberty.
The wave just got ten feet taller, folks.
Still not as scary as Times Square.
Let's try again in 4 years. He can't possibly get re-elected!
Climate change will affect everyone.
I thought Bridgegate was bad. Now this??
It’s not a tsunami, it’s just hair.
Looks like a deadly Trumpnami.
We're all in the same boat; it's gonna be an epic adventure.
President-elect Trump what is your position on immigration?
I guess he couldn't built a wall here.
I've built a wall...of water!
I know it looks old school, but not at all; it's the very newest wave!
You sure you want to stop off in New Jersey?
That's water over the bridge.
Oh No! The Land of the Freak, Home of the Rave!
It's the Immigration Monster - The horrible little hands makes one wonder what lies below!
Brace for Drumping!!!
Did we wait too long?
Wow! It's the PEOTUS hair wave!
On second thought, let’s keep going.
I always knew it would be hard to leave New York.
It's the new authority to check on those "huddled masses".....
I knew that last tweet was a bad idea.
That's not a Tsunami, it's a Trumpami!
It's a 'yuge 'Trumpest'
I'm tired. I'm poor. I'm weary. Turn right.
...and how the sea did stink...
'Trump Harbor'
Don't worry, it's just a comb over.
I told you we'd be better off rowing to Jersey.
I think we shoulda stuck to the Mediterranean ...
...and on you right is the infamous Staten Island Faerie
I'm beginning to harbor some doubts about this voyage.
We can pay.
Please, someone tell the all hands, Trump coiffed wave we're trying to LEAVE America.
Instead of Ellis Island, we now have the Trump Wave to greet new immigrants.
These Presidential tides are not good for tourists.
I KNEW we should have taken that left turn in Albuquerque.....
And this is one of the more recent American landmarks: the Trumpian Wave.
Send me your tired, your poor and your good swimmers.
Watch out for those tiny, grabby hands!
I'm biglier than her, I know more than her.... just let me get my little hands on you immigrant rapists!
I'm starting to doubt that he loves Hispanics.
I guess they don't like out-of-towners.
It's a trumpal wave,,,cover your pussies
They told me tired, poor, huddle masses, and wretched refuse was enough to get in. Now we gotta be tempest-tossed too?
It's fine, it will lose steam soon.
We should have tried before the election.
And still, they did not understand.
I guess it's time we start spreading the news.
Our creation of a genetically modified ocean has led to some unexpected developments.
You are entering the Trump trough. No, the tiny hands do not massage.
Don't worry; he's not grabbing any of us with hands that size...
This is "huge"! He vowed to keep us out!
Notice the small hands. We should be safe enough.
Now that's chutzpah.
Oh no, a 'Rogue Trump Wave'!
Give us your tired", my ass!
I thought this was a hop-on, hop-off deal.
Is this real? Why is the water orange? Why did we not build a bigger boat? Who brought the rum?
Hang on; almost to the land of the Muddled Masses
I see why they named it Superstorm Trump.
Don't worry, we'll make it. The waves are little and they only pretend to be 6'3
I'm not so sure about this "They're coming to America" thing anymore!
Trump really is redefining, "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free..."
And those of you that took dramamine prior to emigrating may notice some unpleasant side effects...
On the plus side, no more tormenting rectal itch.
I forgot about the tempest tossed part
The anonymous children's author tried several edited versions but curiously contemplated the rhyme "row, row row your boat or I'll scare the hell out of you" a bit too long.
He came without elected office. He came without warning or foreign caucus.
Don't worry, it'll blow itself out in soon enough!
Looks like the New World has become the Old World.
Prepare to be alt-dry.
An orange plague cometh!
Hold on..........this isn't usually part of the Statue of Liberty grand tour
It's the golden hair, not the golden door!
He hates the welcome, loves the 'tempest-tost' part.
Well...I recognize the hair.
I told you we should have checked the forecast.
Aye, aye! It was the accursed white male that razeed me.
A storm is on the way -- liberty for the little people could be in danger.
I smell oil spill!
Oh no! Trump!
Trump wave incoming!
Quit whining. Did we complain when the water was calm?
We're in deep water now.
It's only a self-indulgent rain.
Look out ladies, he's going to destroy more than this boat.
don't worry, it isn't the law, just a tweet!
And like a tsunami, the Donald and his cabinet rained down upon the American refugees heading for Cuba.
Tired, poor, huddled masses no longer admitted.
OH NO! IT'S THE TRUMP WAVE.
Looks like our American Dream is about to be swallowed by that HUGE yellow tidal wave.
Mama, that's a really big weave...
Yearning to breathe free? I'd love to breathe free, but jeez, give the wave a Tic-Tac already.
Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free...actually we are full on all those categories.
Gee, this redefines wavy hair completely.
As of noon January 20th, all you huddled masses yearning to breathe free are no longer welcome here.
Somehow I just don't think this is what the Beach Boys meant.
Unlike the Mexican wall, the U.S. paid for this, which we believe explains the likeness.
Trump said things were going to get worse.
We're making the Upper Bay great again!
Check your passports and visas folks. That's INS' newest anti-illegals measure.
They made the American WAVE great again!
And lo, there came unto the people, the promised waves of greatness! Bigly.
Making Nordeasters great again.
Can you give us a push north?
Great.
Hey, a French wave!
Give him the bird, he hates the tweets.

Go back; I said we forgot to rig the BOAT.
Row, what have we got to lose?
Unless my new wife's on board, go back!
Swamped!
Maybe if we paddle strong enough we can turn the tide ?...
I heard there was a Trump wave- but this is ridiculous!
We could really use your wall here Mr. Trump
No worries. We offer 50% off your next boat excursion.
Is this a part of the "Made by New Yorkers" package?
There goes the neighborhood.
What was Frank Gehry thinking?
Wadda mean, man the lifeboats? This IS a lifeboat!
I think we made a wrong turn at Greenland.
Relax, it's just the Donald wave.
Is this a preview of things to come?
In the new America even the East River had to adopt his haircut.
This takes tempest-tossed to a whole new level!
Happy New Fear to you, too, Donald.
This will really mess with those art history students.
The Trump of Liberty: "Send (back)...your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free..."

I might be a bigly wave but trust me....things will be great.
When did New Yorkers become illegal aliens?
This is even better than whale-watching.
I knew there'd be waves but I didn't expect an impenetrable comb over!
For the last time, we must unite on this or be overwhelmed by divisiveness. The correct term is Tsunami.
twitter, instagram and trump....turn around
Who isn't looking for a handout these days.
This wasn't in the brochure...
Give me your tired, your poor, your row boat.
Wait! We're here to barter hair products.

Yep, never leaving Manhattan again.
We better row bigly to escape this wave!
Shouldn't have voted for Jill Stein lol
As towering as it is, we still call it low tide.
We are huddled masses yearning to be free.

Trumping the Statue of Liberty. . . "Go Away!"
You are the master of your own destiny. Now choose your death by : Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
That does not look like our welcome party.
What do you think, left side or centre part for this sea?

This is much worse than the Wall.
Catch this wave.... What have we got to lose.
That swell looks intimidating but I can't see it rocking the boat.
Freedom's hairnet.

This year's regatta is definitely more challenging.
Uh, Oh. The spirit of Elections past.
nothing worse than finding yourself in a symbolic cartoon
Have you been vetted yet?
Hoping we will make it by a hair.
Disney outdid itself with the climate change tsunami simulator.
