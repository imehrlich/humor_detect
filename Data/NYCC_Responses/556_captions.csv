Making fission chips?
Next time I'll bring the protection.
I think I like the French maid outfit better.
Your first husband died how?
Honey, I'm having an affair.
I misunderstood the "well-suited as homemaker", profile.
Is it true I suck all the oxygen out of the room?
I specialized in eggs at the NASA Culinary Institute.
So...how did your first husband die?
Maybe you could just divorce me?
I was thinking more along the lines of French maid.
What would you say to some tang before dinner?
Sometimes it's like we're from different planets.
So, hey, I've been meaning to ask you a little more about your late husband. . .
And what are you preparing for our last anniversary?
Looks like a recipe for disaster.
What happened to the French maid outfit?
Are you sure it calls for mustard gas?
It's like we're not even on the same planet.
Okay, you've made your point. I changed the cat litter.
Why don't you just say you want a Divorce?!!!
Can't you just say you have a headache like most other women?
You need space. I get it.
Were they out of the Sexy French Maid costumes?
I love what you've done with your air.
So I guess you still need space, huh?
You should have just gotten a flu shot
A simple 'I have a headache' would suffice.
Remember when you used to meet me at the door in Saran Wrap?
We had meth on Tuesday.
Exactly what did you mean when you said 'bring protection'?
Whipping up something special for my mother?
I'm leaving you.
If you don't want to have sex, just tell me.
Aren't you taking this Women Are From Venus thing a bit literally.
ok i wlll fix the exhaust fan, good lord!
'It's the name of a book ...you're not really from Venus.'
I’m just whipping up a little something for your mother.
You could've just gotten a flu shot.
'I have a headache’ would've sufficed.
You'd tell me if you weren't happy, right?
Are we expecting my mother for dinner?
Martha, you cannot catch the bird flu from frying eggs.
In fairness, I only suck some of the air out of the room.
So no sex tonight?
I need some space.
Another recipe from your mother?
I'll get the flu shot.
When did things get so toxic between us?
You want space.
We're both eating this meal, right?
We could get an air purifier instead of a divorce.
Wouldn't a divorce be easier?
I'm sensing there won't be after-dinner sex tonight.
Will you at least let me try to explain why I voted for him.
Are you sure it calls for mustard gas?
I feel like there's something you're not telling me.
How about if I just become a vegetarian, too?
Darling, wouldn't it be simpler to just get the flu shot?
You could've just told me you had a headache.
I can't help but notice that the atmosphere between us has changed.
Gastronaut?
I got it. You want some space.
Fine. I'll give you some space.
Now don't you regret not getting the flu shot this year?
I take it you are still mad at me
I get it. You need space.
Dinner will be ready in 10, 9, 8, 7, 6............
I think you're taking our "toxic relationship" too literally.
I know you're under a lot of pressure.
OK> OK> We'll get an exhaust fan.
Alright, we can go back to buying organic.
I think we need some space
Chicken and ricin again?
Do you need some space?
Is the divorce suit really necessary?
Really, Dear...just because I caught it in the East River...
Guess I better fix the exhaust fan.
Wouldn't a range hood be more convenient?
... understand you promised mom to taste it.
I feel like you need space.
Smells great! Is it launch time?
Chicken quarantine?
Wouldn't a vent hood and fan be better?
I need space too, you know.
Why don't you just make it without peanuts?
You seem a little distant.
After dinner you should slip into something a little less airtight.
That's your mother's recipe, that's the same meal your dad had the night before he died.
I feel like you're not telling me something.
You know, you could have just said you had a headache.
This is not what I thought you meant by "wanting more Space."
Why don't we just fix the exhaust fan?
It's not rocket science.
So, not tonight?
The fact that my mother will be joining us for dinner has me a little bit concerned
You seem a little distant.
I didn't literally mean you were "sucking the oxygen out of the room."
Dammit, Karen—just get the flu shot!
Did you just finish reading, "Men are from Mars, women are from Venus"?
It's herpes, not Ebola.
I thought you were taking off today!
I still think a flu shot would have sufficed.
The flu shot really doesn't hurt, you know.
I still think you should have just gotten a flu shot.
OK, OK, I'll clean the litter box, drama queen.
You used to say you worshipped the air I breathed.
Is my mother coming for dinner?
You seem distant.
Couldn't we just install an exhaust fan?
None for me, thanks.
Does this mean no sex tonight?
You seem distant lately.
You could just turn on the fan over the stove.
You seem distant.
It's a welcome change from "I have a headache."
I see you still want space.
I need some space.
A flu shot is more sensible
Honey, please, I meant 'spacey' in a good way.
You're really taking this bird flu thing too far.
I sense space between us.
Eggs quarantine? My favorite.
So, what's the half-life on dinner?
I'm starting to get the 'Women Are from Venus' part.
Hazmati Rice?
I see last night's argument is still on the table too.
Maybe next year you'll get a flu shot.
I know you don't like to cook liver and onions for me, but that suit is overkill.
Are you going to drink your wine?
Are you sure the recipe called for pepper spray?
When I said let's leave after the inauguration, I was thinking more like Canada.
That’s not how my mom makes it.
OK. Give me that phone number for the exhaust hood repairman one more time.
Honey, you're taking the Star Wars Cookbook a little too seriously...
I think a divorce would be simpler, Jane.
I'm getting the feeling that you want more space.
I'll just have the salad.
This isn’t the role play I had in mind.
So does this Mars lifestyle experiment extend to the bedroom?
Is this your way of avoiding sex after dinner?
A French maid's costume is easier.
I might skip dinner.
Can I borrow that to change the baby?
I said I need space, Jeff! What is so difficult to understand about that?
How much Sriracha did you put in there?
I feel like we're in a toxic relationship.
I thought you were using the microwave when you said you were Nuking it.
You could have just said you need space.
On second thought, I don't think I'm hungry.
You don't like the new aftershave then?
You could've just poisoned the wine.
Cooking is not rocket science.
You could've just told me you had a headache.
You know the oven has a vent, right..?
Okay, I get it. You have a headache.
Men are from mars , women are from Venus .
Someone feeling astro-naughty tonight?
I love what you've done with your air.
You're seriously wearing that for the next four years?
Dressing for the job you want?
When I said "If you think your mother is moving in with us, you can save your breath", this isn't what I had in mind...
What's for launch?
Maybe a little breathing room wasn’t all we needed.
Your mother's recipe?
I just need some space.
Really, I think we can afford a hood fan.
Are you still mad about the HPV?
Do you mind telling me where you found this recipe?
O.K. This is the last time I'll ask for liver and onions.
It's only liver and onions.
Is my mom coming over?
So your profile said you're from Venus?
Honey is the meth ready? Th guys are gonna be here any minute.
Honey, I've told you a thousand times: the mother ship is not coming back to get you.
Yes, I smoked a cigarette in the house. Why?
Flu season has arrived!
So you say I suck all the oxygen out of the room?
Why don't you just make it without the onions?
Like you've never farted.
Of course I respect you as a vegan, but I do like my tenderloin once in a while.
Let me guess, Chernobyl Chicken?
When Walter White wore that suit for "cooking," you know he didn't mean omelets, right?
Maybe you'd like to slip into something more comfortable?
This is not what I meant when I asked for more space
Now I can literally push your buttons.
I get it. We need a new vent.
I love that you'll cook liver for me.
I see you've found a recipe for disaster.
Another late night TV purchase I assume?
I thought I smelled liver and onions.
I'm sensing you need some space.
Ricin beans again?
Is that a recipe for disaster?
Does this mean no SEX after dinner?
So the cat can stay?
If you need more space, just tell me.
Thank God the virus didn't stop you from cooking.
You could've just said no to liver and onions.
Looks like a recipe for disaster.
Worried about the Flu bug?
Yes, I’m wearing that new cologne by Trump. Why?
I appreciate your making me liver and onions, but we could do without the sarcasm.
So, exactly what goes into a Three Mile Island omelet?
Then don't make beans
I love "hazmat surprise" night.
You remember wanting me to remind you when you're being passive aggressive, right?
Dare I ask, what's for dinner?
I liked "The Martian" too but I prefer a nice pinot and your French maid outfit.
If you don’t want to have sex, you could just say so.
Honey, you put the "astronomy" in "gastronomy."
In space, no one cares if you're gluten-free.
No, I don't think you're living in a vacuum
Ok! I get the message. I'll call the guy to fix the vent.
I feel like I need to give you some space.
Promise you'll take it off as soon as Trump is impeached?
Not so many plutonium sprinkles on mine, please.
So you decided to go with my mom's recipe after all?
Well, how much space do you need?
Making fission chips again, I see.
Once again, I'm sorry I didn't buy organic onions.
How many light years before dinner?
All I said was, "Would it kill you to cook dinner once in a while?"
You promised you wouldn't go nuclear.
One of your Mothers recipes?
I assume this is my last supper?
You knew I was from Mars when you married me.
And don't let the peas touch the carrots, okay?
Message received...I'll fix the exhaust fan.
So that's a no on my new cologne?
Why don't I tell Mom no perfume at dinner?
I wish you had more confidence in your cooking skills
Why did you set the table for one?
East River Scrod again?
You win. We'll get a new exhaust fan.
Mars? Venus? I forget which one
I liked your barefoot Contessa look better.
Bad day at the lab?
Babe, thanks again for preparing liver and onions.
"You said you wanted some space"?
Do you just need more space?
There's no such thing as too much garlic.
Lately it seems like we're not even on the same planet, Marge.
A lot of people cook liver and onions without all the drama.
Shall I set the periodic table?
I liked it better when you said you have a headache.
I suppose we should get the hood vent repaired.
It's not my fault they confirmed him to head the EPA.
Well...I thought you wanted more space.
You know the flu vaccine is shown to be effective too, right?
If you'd rather not make me liver and onions, just say so.
Houston, we have an omelette.
Is my mother coming for dinner?
So you're going to keep that on for the next four years?
Honey, here's to my last day on the "7-Day Bean Diet."
Martha, Congress isnt repealing the Clean Air Act until next week.
I just need some space right now.
How about slipping into something more comfortable after dinner?
If they're so toxic, why'd you invite them for dinner?
OK, I'll never ask for the liver and onions again...
I'm telling you: somehow today's news from the White House is going to get in there.
Sure, it's a toxic relationship--but don't you think you've gone a bit too far?
Something looks different. Did you get a haircut?
Another of your mother's recipes tonight?
When you said you didn't want to breathe the same air as me, I thought you were moving out.
Are you sure the recipe said mustard gas?
I hope you're not burning our last supper.
I'm just assuming...no breakfast, and no sex.
If you didn't want to make liver and onions why didn't you just say so.
Will you come out if I turn off the news?
If you didn't want to make me liver and onions, you could have just said so.
If you didn't want to make liver & onions you should have just said so
Okay, I get it. You need some space.
I'm sensing you need some space.
Oh, come on! It's only liver and onions. Could be worse!
Did you get a haircut?
The relaxation in EPA regulations hasn't kicked in yet.
I do not like green eggs and ham.
Thanks for making breakfast before taking off.
NOW can you stand the heat?
Think I will pass on dinner tonight.
Just how much space do you want?
Has there been a case where someone caught the bird flu cooking eggs?
Got it---I'll never request liver again.
Would you like to slip into something more comfortable?
You wouldn't be trying to poison me again, would you?
yeah - well, let me tell you about MY day.
I usually just use an apron.
What do you mean you got the recipe from The Alternative Facts Cookbook?
We could ask them not to talk politics
Honey, what a strange question! Of course my life insurance premiums are fully paid.
What do you know that I don't know?
So I guess you don’t want to hear how my day was.
I'm sensing that you need some space.
So you're telling me you need space.
Shall I slip into something more uncomfortable?
Are the germophobe anonymous meetings working?
Are you trying to tell me you need some space?
Kidneys or liver and onions?
Is this another snide comment on my personal hygiene?
Stop googling harmful effects
It's these intimate moments that I cherish.
Would it be fair to say you're not in the mood tonight?
Let me guess... you need more space?
C'mon, give me a hint. Chemical or biological?
One small crepe for man, one giant leek for mankind.
So how's that molecular gastronomy class going?
Earth to Brenda.
Not true. The last time I requested liver and onions was TWO YEARS ago!
Are you telling me you need space?
Launch time?
Why don't you finish your drink and relax. You don't have to blast off for 3 hours.
Why are you asking about my life insurance?
So, how's the neurosis?
I don't see the input port for your wine.
I'm clearly not suited for this kind of food.
What do you mean "alternate eating experience?"
It smells delicious, but will it pair well with Tang?
It won't work. News about Trump is bound to get in.
This earthling votes for take-out.
Will dinner be ready before liftoff?
Honey, its been twelve years since NASA rejected your application. Perhaps it's time to move on.
I'll just be having the wine...
I'm sensing that you need more personal space.
And you don't see this as a manifestation of your emotional unavailability?
You're cute when you're irradiated.
I promise never to ask for liver and onions again.
Ok. I promise it's the last time I ask for liver and onions.
I think we need to talk about you taking your work home.
Fine. I take it back. Cooking dinner is rocket science.
You remembered my liver and onions!
Are you planning to wear that thing all four years?
Where'd you find fresh Uranium?
I said your cooking was bad; I didn't say it was hazardous.
Lighten up. You're taking the 'sell-by' date much too seriously.
I guess you're not in the mood.
It's only the first month of Trump's presidency. Try to pace yourself.
I wasn't saying we have to have liver and onions.
If you don't want to make liver and onions for me, just say so.
Is it the cologne?
I thought you said Venetian cuisine.
All right. No need to get drastic. I'll sign the divorce papers.
Ok I get it I'll never ask for liver again.
Its very becoming. You look almost weightless.
"Is this in response to my saying, 'Surprise me'"?
I get it...you don't like liver and onions.
I understand that the FluMist has been deemed ineffective, but don't you think you're being a bit irrational?
I really am okay without the onions.
Houston, we have an omelette.
Are you really sure you don't mind making me fried beef liver with onions?
I get it. You're not a fan of liver.
Ok! I voted for him. But how will a quarantine help?
Good grief, Laura... It doesn't mean you are literally 'from Venus', you know.
You know, there is such a thing as being TOO careful...
Come on, I don't ask you to cook fish that often!
Something tells me you're not ready to clear the air.
OK, I voted for him. But isn't this a little extreme?
So you're saying you don't like liver and onions
Earth to Jane, would you like some more wine?
I couldn't find a good pairing for the chicken and ricin.
Throw away that old teflon pan, already!
On the plus side, we're the only family in Chernobyl with locally grown produce.
What women's movement is this?
It's possible to demonstrate your disdain AND breathe the same air as the president.
i get it, am from Venus and you are from Mars !
Trust me. After two glasses of wine your cooking smells wonderful.
So, you've decided to try my mother's recipe?
I don't know what you're cooking, but it smells out of this world!
This relationship has become way too toxic.
I don't think you understand the gravity of the situation.
I feel we've lost a certain closeness
I never should have told you how I voted.
So the recipe said it would take your breath away.
A simple "not tonight, dear" would have sufficed...
Can I interest you in a glass of '65 Tang while you cook?
We can't not talk about the election forever.
Can I have your wine?
Aren't you taking this I hate cooking you liver issue a little too far?
Can I pour you some more Tang?
If you don't want to use my mother's recipe, why don't you just say so?
How's the news filter working this evening?
You know you can turn it to low, right?
I really do appreciate you fixing me liver and onions.
When you asked for some space in our relationship, I had no idea.
Not liver and onions again!
No, actually I didn't happen to catch the evening news tonight. Why?
That's not really what I meant when I said I needed more space.
Why can't you just wear an apron like everybody else?
I guess we could do without some regulations.
Really Alice? I ask for liver and onions once a year on my birthday.
You'll be a chef to the stars one way or the other.
Of course I think your job is important.
..then he drops the smallpox vial and it bounces off the table straight into my lab coat pocket.
I think I need more space, too
It's just liver and onions. I like liver and onions. I don't see why you need to make such a deal about it.
If you're fixing that for me, I'm not hungry.
Meth and eggs - my favorite!
What do you mean you need some space?
You know, hon, you don't have to start dinner the moment you get home from work.
Ricin beans again?
Maybe we both need some space.
I think we both need our space.
Honey, I think someone's trying to kill me.
That's one small crepe for a man.
I guess pretending you're on the moon is cheaper than actually moving to Canada.
Are you mad at me?
Thanks for agreeing to another date despite the flatulence incident.
Some women find flatulence sexy.
No, I will not pretend to be George Jetson tonight.
Mmmm, that smells out of this world!
I still think the recipe meant to read stir in 'spice,' not in space.
I'm guessing that those beans are genetically modified.
Can I lick the spoon?
So, we're not talking?
I don't think that's what our therapist meant when he said our relationship is toxic
I'd like to propose a toast before we're toast.
Look, you wanted flambe', and I've been burned before...
I see you're using your mother's recipe again.
I assume I've annoyed you once again.
I ate at the office.
It wasn't me.
Well, at least I can stand the heat.
Should I be afraid to ask what's for dinner?
It wasn't just her body language. There was something else.
Well, I think you're sucking all the air out of our relationship too.
We all have filters, some more obvious than others.
I promise to be less handsy next time you wear your "Kiss the cook" apron.
Susan, you've made your point, I'll stop eating chili.
Admitting your cooking is a health hazard is the first step.
I hear Mars is the new Canada.
Welcome home, by the way.
Making your killer chili again?
How about slipping into something more comfortable?
I get it. You want your own space.
Claiming there's no atmosphere isn't going to get you that new kitchen, Lucille.
Wouldn't it be easier to just buy organic?
Nothing happens in a vacuum.
I'm pretty sure the recipe calls for plantains, not plutonium.
I thought we were moving to Canada?
You needn't be so dramatic. I like liver and onions
I just need a little space.
You look hot in that outfit.
Did you remember to wash your hands?
I think I'll just have a salad.
My mom just wore an apron.
Special sauce?
Okay, fine, but I'm NOT drinking Tang with dinner!
So, I guess I can drink your wine too.
I see that you're taking eating clean pretty seriously.
Dear, I really appreciate you cooking liver and onions for me, but do you have to be so dramatic?
Honey....I think that when the recipe said "nuke it" it meant use the microwave.
And I say, it doesn't make you look fat
Honey, I think you're taking this "nuclear family" thing a bit too far.
Liver and onions again?
None for me, thanks.
For heaven's sake, it's just gluten.
Did you wash your hands?
Okay. I admit that saying I needed more space was insensitive.
Then don't make fish.
If you don't like my mom's recipe for fried cabbage, just say so.
What do you mean you need space?
O.K. you don't like liver and onions. I get it.
It said our sex life should be active, not radioactive
I'm going to go ahead and guess that whatever you read was fake news.
Preparing a satellite dish?
I see my 'toxic personality' crack is still on the table.
Between the glasses of wine and this protective device I was hoping I wouldn't be able to hear his inane ramblings anymore.
Honey, they're not planning to abolish the Clean Air Act until next month.

My mother used to wear an apron.
Are you sure that's how you make Moon Pies?
Let me guess liver and onions tonight.
I wish you wouldn't take the Senate's nuclear option so literally.
I think this Barolo will do nicely with the liver and onions.
Is it just me or has our relationship turned toxic?
Suit yourself
If you wanted more space, you should have just told me.
Maybe you should stop using the smoke alarm as the oven timer.
Shouldn't you wash your hands first?
Why no, I don't think it makes your butt look big.
Fusion, not fission.
When I said our relationship was becoming toxic, I was speaking figuratively.
Is there something you're not telling me?
Where should I pour your drink?
Honey...when I said I needed some space...I didn't mean it literally.
I thought you were kidding when you said you did not want to even breathe the same air....
Fukushima fish fry?
What do you mean I've developed a toxic personality?
Shall I slip into something more . . . industrial?
Is it meth yet?
Is that the emergency cyanide?
You know that "Nuke for five minutes" means to microwave, right?
I'm sensing you need space.
Honey, have you seen the rat poison that I keep in the garage?
On second thought, I'd rather eat out.
I take it my "Kiss the Cook" apron was a bad idea.
It's just a little gluten.
Thank you so much for moving to Beijing with me.
Honey, it's just a cold.
"No onions" would've been easier...
Have you been reading the package ingredients again?
Personally, I've always loved your mother's recipes.
Practicing for the apocalypse again?
I might be drunk ... but I'm not radioactive pork chops two nights in a row drunk.
Would you be terribly offended, Dear, if the kids and I ordered take-out tonight?
OK honey you finish the eggs and I'll pour you another Tang
Sure, now you can stand the heat.
When I said I needed "space".... I didn't think you'd take it this far!
Is it launch time?
Honey, you are not still mad at me, are you??? What exactly is this special surprise dinner you are cooking for me???
And what thing has Facebook told you to be afraid of today?
Are we expecting my mother for dinner?
Honey, is there something you're not telling me about the home radon test results?
I want out of this toxic relationship.
I feel as if we're drifting apart.
Reading the EPA website again?
I think you'll find that once you get past the smell it tastes really good.
Can you change the twins' diapers while you're at it?
You have to come out for the wine at some point.
"Haz-mat-touille" again?
I thought you were going to take that off after the election.
I saw it on America's Nuclear Test Kitchen.
The range hood is easier.
How were things at Monsanto today?
Should I be concerned?
Earth to Betty Crocker, do you read me?
Is MY mother coming to dinner tonight?
Seems as though you need some space
Your words say you don't mind cooking the bacon, but your CDC suit says that you do.
You look hot in that outfit.
Not everything has to be rocket science.
Eggs and meth?
Oh, but I can't have a sports car.
How long have you felt our relationship was toxic?
Am I wearing too much cologne?
Green eggs and ham again?
You'd make a great chef in a restaurant with no atmosphere
I thought it was only my laugh that was infectious.
Our therapist didn't mean it literally when he said 'toxic relationship'
Still mad?
Oh…I thought you said hazmat soup.
I'd settle for a toxic relationship.
I sense a certain hostility.
You may not die from your cooking but what about me?
You don't have to follow my mom's recipe exactly.
And your plan for his next 100 days?
You take the comfort out of comfort food.
Honey, I just got the oxygen bill today.
In what way am I creating a hostile atmosphere?
But I thought you loved liver and onions.
Did you become left-handed while in Space?
She's so vegan she can't even smell the bacon.
So you've gone back to stove top meth?
Okay, okay, I get it. Now that I'm the head of the EPA, I have to start taking air pollution more seriously.
Your beauty regimen gets more and more complex every day
Wouldn't a splatter screen have been easier?
I thought preparing to go to Mars after the election was just talk.
It's like you're a million miles away.
That's one small egg for man, one giant soufflé for mankind.
I guess you've decided to take some space.
I just love our gluten nights together
You know I'd help, but I just needed to decompress first.
You could've told me you didn't like to cook before we got married.
OK...OK...I'll see about a new vent fan!
You put the "astronomy" in "gastronomy".
Mm, Is that Polonium I smell?
New recipe?
Again with the killer stir-fry?
I think I'll let you try it first...
I promise I won't talk about politics anymore.
It's JUST liver.
I think we should cancel our Amazon Prime membership.
Honey, I've been thinking about sex ever since I got home from work.
Note to self... change my dating profile from "looking for an out of this world cook" to "looking for a good cook"!!
I'm guessing you need some space this evening?
My atomic chili recipe is way simpler.
You misunderstood. I said "a bowl of soup," not "Ebola soup."
I guess you really are from Venus.
I take it you're counting on this recipe going viral?
You know I said, "Mild", right?
Y'know what would really be out of this world? Bacon.
You could just tell me you have a headache you know.
You could just say you don't like broccoli.
Something smells good, but you wouldn't know it.
You're not wearing that on Valentine's Day, are you?
How much more space do you need?
Thanks, but I would like for you to taste it first
Your farts don't smell that good, either
So are men the only thing you are allergic to?
Wouldn't it be easier to install a smoke alarm?
You didnt mind cooking burgers for me when we were dating, Miss Vegan
Honey, I'm getting dinner ready asbestos I can.
Wow, dinner! One small step for mankind.
You made your point. I'll go see a gastroenterologist.
This is exactly what I meant when I said you were being too defensive.
Does it block all sarcasm or just mine?
Everything has become so toxic.
Remember, reduce heat after three half-lifes.
Should I ask?
But does it keep you from crying when dicing onions?
What's nukin'?
Actually, I would prefer it if you would change out of your work clothes before preparing dinner.
Just double the recipe, it's not rocket science.
Do you need some space?
Is the range hood not working?
Have you considered that moving to Canada might be more practical than moving to Mars?
Yes, honey, next time I'll buy organic.
This seems more like a "not tonight or ever" romantic dinner to me.
OK Honey. We can take Liver and onions off the menu.
Do you even know what gluten is?
Really... my liver and onions are that bad?
Easy on the plutonium .
Honestly, that GMO bacon can't hurt you.
Why don't you just buy non-GMO eggs?
Now, I wish I had opened a more fire-retardant chardonnay.
I'm guessing this has something to do with my joke at the party about your cooking.
When I said I wanted more space in our relationship...
That's one small meal for a man.
That's one small omelet for man.
When you said you needed some space, you really meant it.
I'm starting to miss the pink pussy hat.
Dinner smells out of this world.
I thought that after we got married you would stop wearing that.
Honey! When I mentioned I needed "some space from you" I never imagined this.
So you're probably not drinking your wine then....
It's a cold sore, Karen!
I know it was silent, but deadly?
So, is this your new look?" "It's only for the next four years.
Not the hazmat hash again.
HAS OUR RELATIONSHIP BECOME THAT TOXIC?
I had beans for lunch.
Another executive order?
All I said was that it doesn't inspire confidence.
Gee, I like the smell of liver and onions.
'Recipe for disaster' again tonight, dear?
Don't you think its time to give up the Teflon pans?
Are you sure the recipe said twenty cloves of garlic?
You're sweet to cook non-vegan for me.
Is my non-vegan, gluten-rich, immigrant-harvested, GMO-containing dinner ready?
The recipe said, "Cook, fully wrapped, for five minutes..."
It's a recipe from that show "Breaking Bad"
Don't you think this is carrying the 'toxic relationship' thing a bit too far?
For God's sake, it's gluten, not napalm...
If you can't stand the smell, get out of the kitchen.
I'm getting the feeling that you need some space.
I'm afraid to ask.
What happened to that little blue dress?
Thanks, hon. Oh, and could you also iron a few shirts before your mission?
Is this your idea of asking for space ?
it's JUST liver & onions, ya'know
"I just don't think that's what the cookbook author meant by 'gear up for a great taste adventure' ".
You need to stop alienating me, Alice.
Well, the smell of frying liver never bothered me.
Why do I feel like there's something you're not telling me?
Mom wants to know if we've thought about having kids
Hey, you're the one who said I need to eat more cruciferous vegetables.
Maybe just leave out the garlic next time?
Ground Control to Major Mom...
Is it me or the onions?
I think you're confusing Asian Fusion with Cold Fusion
I wish you wouldn't bring work home with you.
I think that you're taking your science of cooking class way too seriously.
So your profile says you're not from around here.
I trust you'll be joining me for dinner...
Let me guess....fresh catch from the Flint River?
You mean I literally suck all the air out of the room?
Not quite what I meant by role-playing...
Where did you even find a recipe for skunk stir fry?
I see you're anticipating the changes at the EPA
Then why make it so easy to push your buttons?
You could have just said, "No."
You honestly think you can go four years in that thing?
Lemme guess... Gastronaut?
Your cooking is out of this world.
Maybe you should cut back on the garlic some.
Why can't we emit carbon like normal folk?
(a) I can make my own quinoa and (b) your doctor has told you on numerous occasions that you aren't allergic to gluten.
Don't we have a spatter screen?
We're cancelling The New Yorker.
Applying for the kitchen staff at the Trump White House?
The knitted pink hats are more specific.
Just because I asked for liver and onions doesn't mean you have to be so dramatic! Just because I asked for liver and onions doesn't mean you have to be so dramatic! dramatic
Trying another of your mom's recipes?
I know you are vegan, so I appreciate you cooking my steak.
So what exactly is molecular gastronomy?
You do know that you can always find another study with a different conclusion.
Look, Donald Trump is our president whether you like it or not. Please take that off.
What do you mean- 'no atmosphere'?
Liver and onions again?
First it was peanut butter. Then it was gluten. Now air?
Can I help with anything?
Suit yourself
Can't you just live in a bubble like everyone else?
Or, we could just pay more for birth control.
I think you're overstating the risks of genetically modified food."
I can't wait to see how you're planning to eat it.....
So let me get this straight, you've already eaten, but you're whipping up something special for me?
I think you're taking this toxic relationship thing a bit too far.
It's called HAZ=MAT surprise.
There's nothing like liver and onions to set the mood.
Don't you think you are taking this silent treatment thing a little bit far?
Are you doing something different with your hair?
Is this a commentary on my personality?
Honey, it's bacon fat not Ebola.
It's not that kind of fusion.
Spicier!
No, I don’t think it makes you look fat.
Do you know something I don't know?
Is this your first time in the CDC dating pool?
Oh, no. We talk. You just don't listen.
One of these days, Alice!
Ever since your mission you've been a bit... distant.
You look radiant this evening.
This'll be a nice break from all those freeze-dried meals.
I take it you didn't like my use of the phrase "barefoot and pregnant."
Good grief, I asked for a little Wasabi, not dioxin.
I didn't know NASA put out a cook book.
So, this is your plan for the next four years?
You're dressing like a woman? I don't get it.
I appreciate it when you cook liver and onions for me.
Fine, I'll buy organic next time.
Were you on Ebay again?
You said you needed some space.
I don't think that's what they meant by "heat, covered".
Is this what you meant by needing more space?
The NASA package recommends Valpolicella with the Bolognese.
I know he's picking a fight with China and inciting anger in the Muslim world... but why didn't you buy me a suit too?
You could just turn on the stove vent, you know.
Honey, that's not how you make moon cakes
The brussel sprouts aren't going to kill you.
I know it's my mom's recipe Helen, but do you have to be so dramatic?
So, basically, that's the difference between jalapeños and habañeros.
First anti-bacterial soap now this - I think you have a problem
"Martha, find anything new at the neighborhood garage sale?'
I thought we weren't having sex til later.
And to drink, how about a nice "Chateau Tang, '65?"
I feel like you're taking this Mars and Venus thing a little too far.
You've got to stop bringing your work home with you
That in no way proves you're allergic to cooking.
So, I think you may be taking this whole vegan thing a little too seriously.
Did you do something different to your hair?
I see you are using your mother's recipe.
Look, if you'd rather not cook me chili, just say so.
A pinch of dark matter, maybe?
I don't think you have to take the little drawing on the salsa bottle literally.
Honey, I know you don't like liver and onions like I do, but this is over the top.
I know we're white, but it was just a quarter teaspoon of paprika.
Yep, that's just the way mom used to make it.
Sometimes it feels like I'm living with someone from a completely different planet.
So, why don't you try cooking with olive oil instead of peanut oil?
Ok Amy, I understand. You need your space.
I take it they're enforcing "dress like a woman" at NASA?
You didn't have to take my "toxic waste" comment so personally.
Why do I feel like part of a large experiment?
Theil has a bunker, you have a hazmat suit, but I'm sticking with red wine and denial.
I don't think this is what the marriage counselor had in mind when she said to spice things up with role play.
OK, we don't have to have liver and onions.
Maybe it is time to go Organic.
There are other ways to say you don't like it.
You've never looked more beautiful.
Marilyn, it's time we talked about your OCD.
Whippin' up your 'Space Odyssey Omelets' again, hon?"
Why don't you have a glass of wine and slip into something more comfortable...
... and you're sure you don't have an eating disorder
Excellent - we haven't had 'The Right Stuffing' in quite some time.
...but if you read THIS month's study, they actually say eggs and red wine won't kill you.
Have you done something new with your hair?
Next time, I'd be happy to slice the onions.
You've piqued my interest.
Are you sure they said it was safe for me not to have one?
Cheers to President Trump for telling us about all the nutrition in toxic waste!
Is this your way of saying you think this relationship has become toxic?
Do I detect some reluctance to discuss the divorce?
Just the wine for me, thanks.
Don't go to any trouble just for me.
OK OK - No more liver.
Liver and onions?
Honey, why don't you slip into that white hazmat suit number after dinner.
Recipes for chemical warfare may be on YouTube but that doesn’t make them right.
Honey, I didn't mean that "You look Radiant" literally.
You know, the recipe says you could've substituted pineapple chunks for the dioxin.
Next time you could try soaking the onions first.
Mmmmm. Liver and onions, my favorite.
your suit expired 6 months ago
Just give me a little space, Allen.
Look, I'm sorry they didn't sell organic.
If you don't want to have sex with me anymore, why don't you just say so?
Can I have your wine?
Well actually, one CAN be too careful.
So you really are from Venus.
Going 'off recipe'?
You knew before we married l liked liver and bacon curry,why the bid deal now all of a sudden ?
Still with the subtle hints that I should quit smoking.
It's okay now. I've turned the news off.
Calories do not fly through the air!
How long until Lent ends?
Natural gas? We don't have natural gas ... oh.
I didn't think this what you meant when you said you needed some space
You make the best yellowcake.
So...is this chili going to be spicy...?
So you aren't joining me for dinner?
I think we need some space
It's probably just me, but I sense a distance between us.
That's one small step for manicotti...
Maybe not THAT spicy.
Does this Chardonnay go with polonium?
Thanks for fixing me dinner, but how come you aren't having any ?
I feel like you would ignore me if you knew I was here.
Look. If the wine can breathe, so can you.
Um... Should I have my suit on?
What, exactly, IS for dinner?
Another recipe from the hazmat cookbook?
Okay, I get it, you need space.
Still allergic to cooking?
Do you really think you can stay in that for four years?
I guess it's really over when we can't even breathe the same air anymore.
I should have been more specific when I suggested role-playing.
Gotta hand it to ya babe. You're the only person I know that can spend all day training for a manned flight into deep space, come home and cook me a burger.
Supermarket brand doesn't mean toxic.
I think we need a little less space.
You've made your point, from now on I'll only buy organic.
I hope you noticed that I don't bring MY work home.
Are you really not taking this off for the next 4-8 years?
No wiggle room on cilantro?
A bottle of Stoli, Chernobyl Stroganoff, and thou.
All I'm saying is give toxic masculinity a chance.
Does cooking help you decompress?
You're not drinking your wine. Is there something the matter?
Well...it sure is nice to have you back!
At least wait till after I forget Valentine's day to go out of your way to ignore me.
So... You're from Venus?
This date has no atmosphere.
I don't think that frying up a couple of not organic eggs for me really requires all that protection.
Don't you think moving to Canada would be much simpler?
Really don't like the smell of that liver, do you?
You're swallowing some before I'll touch it
It's safe to assume another USDA regulation has been torpedoed?
If you can't stand the heat, you could just get out of the kitchen.
I know you're a vegetarian, but that's a bit much for bacon.
We don't breathe together anymore
Does Gwyneth explain exactly how this improves scrambled eggs?
I didn't know mother was joining us for dinner.
Honey, should I just cook if the bacon is that scary?
I get it. You still wish we lived on different planets.
There's nothing like cooking with gas.
Exactly how spicy?
That hazmat suit would look great on my bedroom floor.
Mushroom cloud for dessert?
what exactly is this 'secret ingredient' you've been bragging about??
After 30 years of marriage, she finally indulged his "nuclear winter" fantasy
I'm missing the point of your elaborate sarcasm.
I take it they were out of organic eggs?
The gauge still shows one part per million of glutin. I think you ought to change the filter.
I'm guessing it's too soon for make-up sex.
Well I might not be worth taking it off for, but this chardonnay certainly is.
Dress for the job you have not the job you want
And I thought the vegan phase was bad
So I guess you heard my mom is coming for dinner.
Look, if you REALLY don't like them, we don't have to have them.
Should I give you some space when you're cooking?
'Let me do that Kellyanne while you get out of those work clothes'.
I think I'll pass on dinner tonight.
I wasn't clear what you meant by "bring your own atmosphere".
OK ABSOLUTELY the last time I ask for liver and onions on my birthday.
Tuna meltdown tonight?
I'll take mine with extra gamma rays and electrons.
None for me, thank you.
Thanks for catering to Mother's new diet, honey. I think she's finally warming up to you a bit.
I suppose you want your space?
On second thought, maybe we don’t have to invite my mother over for dinner.
So... what kind of underwear do you have on?
So if we get the microwave fixed, you only need the lead vest, right?
Should I be worried?
Apparently, you have no intention of leaving the kitchen.
You win, I'll buy you the non-Teflon cookware.
Thanks for making that. I know it's not your favorite.
It still won’t stop the smoke alarm from going off.
Honey, I need some space.
All I'm saying is that it seems like you could just eat some lentils or kale if you need more oxygen in your blood.
Allergies bothering you again?
When you said our marriage had become toxic, I didn't realize you meant literally.
Petal, I think the recipe said oxident free, not oxygen free.
Hey Hon, I'm sorry ..... when do you think you'll be able to breathe the same air as me again?
A lid on the skillet would've prevented oil splash just as well.
That outfit still gets me going.
Don't you believe the label that says it's gluten free?
You know, if you didn't fry everything I might not have as much gas.
Liver
Do you have to pull out the hazmat suit every time my mother visits?
I think you'll find alcohol is a better filter against fake news.
Have you lost all your senses, woman?
Is kale really worth all that?
Wouldn't it be easier to get rid of the Teflon pans.
Why did you cancel our appointment with the marriage counselor?
Should I be worried?
Meth again???
I guess you really do need more space.
You really hate onions.
The word is 'poisson', not 'poison'.
Are we expecting your mother?
I TOLD you not to get Trump steaks.
Trying another one of your mother's recipes, I see.
No, they're not Porcini, they're Chernobyl.
No, that was the expiration date, not the half-life.
Is that one small step for mankind or a wok?
Is there something you're not telling me?
I think you're over reacting to his EPA choice
Does Trump still stink?
So, how was your day at the Superfund site?
On the second date Bob came to regret his lie about liking spicy food on the first date.
Cooking with municipal water again?
Polonium again?
Is this anything like safe sex?
So you think our relationship is becoming toxic ?
I'll still eat it. Wine is the duct tape of the kitchen.
Sorry I mentioned that hair in my soup.
You touched the monolith and what then?
Guess you are not taking Any chances with the no abortion law.
Cooking meth on the stove top again honey?
I swear to God my mother doesn't know about your lethal peanut allergy!
I'm almost sure my 'toxic personality' isn't airborne.
Why don't I prep the onions next time?
Yes dear, you are the Neil Armstrong of the kale omelette.
I like to think of myself as a "Salmonella Terminator".
You have to open up to me at some point.
Does your therapist know about this?
Is there something about this meal that your not telling me?
I feel space between us
With you working on zika, I would have thought you'd stop bringing your work home.
You look nice tonight.
Good grief, honey. They're only carbs.
What wine pairs with contaminated fish?
So, anything new going on at the EPA?
Moving on from molecular to atomic cooking?
You've made your point and I'm sorry. I shouldn't have called your cooking hazardous waste.
Come on Honey, I don't fart that bad....
I guess you still need your space?
A hazmat omelet? Ah, the new EPA cookbook.
I don't think that's how sous vide works.
Cooking liver again, I see.
Just say it ... you're suffocating in this relationship!
OK, I get it. I’ll shop organic for now on.
I guess you remember my remark last time about the meat being a tad under-cooked.
Please tell me this is the last of the Trump Steaks.
You might be taking gluten-free a bit too far.
Did you do something with your hair?
God you're hot.
Are you making MoonPie again?
You know, I'm starting to like that aftershave the kids got me for Christmas.
Come on. Liver and onions doesn't smell that bad.
Let me guess, "Blue Apron Skunk Burgers?"
Lighten up Helen! Have a drink for Christ's sake! According to the EPA,CDC and HAZMAT there's an acceptable level of 40 ppt of PFOA's in that frying pan.
Is there something I should know?
More wine for me, less whining from you.
That's one small stir for women...
Did I mention I had a huge lunch today
Did you remember to remove the poison gland?
What if I wasn't the last man on Earth.
Are you going to wear that for the next four years?
I take it they were out of the non-GMO onions.
I don't care what you heard at the women's march. Being white, male and middle class is not a communicable disease.
Enough with the clean eating, Barb.
Thanks for adding nuts.
If I admit climate change is real, will you stop with this Rogue NASA nonsense?
It's not like I ask you to fry fish all the time!
With you, being from Venus is no metaphor.
Yes, my life insurance is paid up. Why do you ask?
How much alcohol will I need to drink to enjoy this?
Honey, mine was just one vote.
Run out of aprons?
Okay Lover, no way liver.
Wouldn’t it just be easier to get rid of that Teflon frying pan?
Not too spicy.
You can drop the theatrics. GMO ingredients can't be THAT dangerous.
I can turn on the hood
A little gluten isn't going to kill you.
Honey, if you can't stand the heat...
It isn't cooking asparagus that smells bad.
I almost forgot, Wednesday is Toxican food night.
I don't know why, but I still struggle with abandonment issues.
It might be simpler to switch from Teflon to ceramic.
Oh, threat levels must be a thing again.
Mother always made liver without all this.
So, how's that "living in a vacuum" working out for you?
Your dating profile didn't mention that it was an airborne gluten allergy.
I asked if you would like to join me in a Tanqueray, not a tank array.
You know, maybe I'm not so hungry after all.
I don't think I've ever had shrimp with both EPA and FDA warnings.
I feel underdressed.
How's that new sriracha recipe coming along?
I believe the recipe said 'exotic', not 'toxic' dear.........
Liver again?
Take that thing off and have a drink. The EPA isn't shutting down until next week
How many drinks have you had? You're wearing the vacuum cleaner and burning the eggs!
"You look hot".
It's okay to go light on the garlic.
Fine, next time I'll buy organic
Will you stop it. My hangover farts aren't THAT bad
Plutonium doesn't work in everything honey.
Whatever you're cooking, looks radiant.
Fry me to the moon.
Must you be so dramatic Must you be so dramatic? It's only a small case of herpes.
Next time buy organic
I guess you heard who he chose to head the FDA.
It's the first thing I've tried to make from the Heisenberg cookbook. I hope you like it!
It doesn't have to be Mexican again
All right...I admit it...your cooking is out if this world!
So, I take it you went with the nuclear option, tonight.
Oh, so there is gluten in the air now too?
Can I get ebola that?
Well maybe I need more space, too.
It's nice they let you disembark early.
Marge, I could be way off base, but I get the feeling there's something you're not telling me.
I didn't really mean to say your cooking was toxic.
After a day with the estate planning lawyer, Bob ventured in the kitchen to see what was for dinner.
I always wanted to see how a vampire cooks with garlic.
So, I guess this means I'm no longer the air you breathe?
So, this is what NASA does now that it's got its funding cut, huh?
Are you taking this GMO thing too seriously?
What new life insurance policy?
You're taking this vegan thing a little far.
Are you sure that's health food?
Ok, you've made your point, we'll go organic....
I'm glad to see you understand the gravity of the situation.
Brad Pitt wears Obsession.
Can I pour your wine in somewhere in your backpack?
Honey, I think "Trump Steaks" is just a brand name
Will this call for red or white?
Do I need red, white, or flame retardant with this tonight?
Hey Alexa, when are my scrambled eggs going to be ready?
I coughed one time.
I promise to stop talking about politics.
Look, I'm sorry I couldn't find organic.
I just feel like we're drifting apart.
Why cook me a chili if you think it will give me gas?
Thanks for including the cilantro
Perhaps we should eat out.
Jackie Gleason was using a metaphor Alice, I'm being literal.
First the deodorant under my pillow, now this... I just sense you want to tell me something.
The flu season requires extraordinary protection.
Why Don't You Slip Into Something A Little More Comfortable
So. Exactly what is the defining feature of this Tox-Mex?
Can I assume the cilantro rice is just for me?
Sorry to pull you back from the Space Station on such short notice, but you know how I love your omelets.
Is this the new Homeland Security?
For the last time, there's no such thing as 'alternative gas.'
Is it that bad, I need to tell Houston we have a problem?
Honey, I think GMO's are only dangerous if eaten.
I'll get the Rolaids.
You've done something with your hair?
I'd like mine solar-flare side up.
It suits you.
Look, I know it's my mother's recipe, but really....
Shall I put the Limburger away?
Most of my girlfriends just throw on one of my old shirts, but this works too!
Yeah, I'd never touch the food I serve my kids either.
I sense you're not cooking organic tonight.
"I told you, I'll take it off in four years.|
Seriously, we can get Chinese.
I'm all for farm-to-table, but is mars-to-table really necessary?
Haz mat we go out to dinner instead?
Your taking this 'Men are from Mars' thing a little serious aren't you?
Honey, I'd like us to start seeing other astronauts.
Am I allowed conjugal visits ?
Honey, are we having your delicious Pollo ala Air Pollution?
I don't think this is what your therapist meant by being more self-contained.
I only shook hands with Trump! I'm sure I'm not infected.
I see you caught that Monsanto documentary.
Thanks for making my breakfast right before you leave for Mars.
OK, I get it. The teflon cookware for your birthday was a bad idea.
You seem to be a bit aloof tonight.
Mary's passive aggressive plea for "some space" was not getting through to Frederick.
I feel like you're blocking me out.
Free-range chicken from Chernobyl, again?
I may have overstated my fondness for spicy food, Doris.
Is our relationship that toxic ?
I'm going to get you a hand-held hair dryer for Christmas.
Ok honey, I'll fix the damn kitchen fan!
I'll go set the lead plates out.
I said "lunch," not "launch.'
If you can't stand the heat,...
Another recipe from the Chernobyl Cookbook?
Don't hover, Harold. I told you I could no longer breathe the same air as you if you voted for that jackass...
What I hear you saying is that you need some space.
Okay, you win. Next time, we'll buy organic.
There's no more romance in our marriage.
Yes, Marge. I DO understand that you need your own space.
It's not you, it's me.
Maybe you're taking this gluten alergy thing a little too far?
One of these days I'll get the stove vent fixed, I promise.
Exploding eggs again?
I only sneezed once. I think you're overreacting.
Breaking bad eggs?
How's your molecular gastronomy class going?
Smelling the food won't make you fat!
Maybe I should have mentioned this earlier but I don't even like onions.
You shouldn't believe everything you read about Teflon coating.
I get it, Barb, you're a vegan. Just make sure my burger is medium rare.
I thought we agreed to stop taking work home.
A glass of wine before dinner is the least of my health concerns.
Aren’t you going a little overboard on this gluten-free thing?
You don't reduce your carbon footprint that way.
Aren’t you being a bit premature, Honey? Environmental deregulation won’t make it to our kitchen for another eleven months or so!
Vent still broken?
As a recovering germaphobe, I must say that I am impressed with your hygiene.
So it was listed as "cook suit" on craigslist?
I hope that you're not planning on wearing that in bed.
You look ready for a big flash in the pan.
I'm pretty sure that 'she sucks the oxygen out of the room' is just an expression.
The therapist said "our relationship is toxic," and I think you're taking it too literal.
This recipe is gonna be a real blast.
OK, I get it! I screwed up. Organic, non-GMO veggies next time...
You know, out of the frying pan and into the fire is just an expression.
What is it this time, Gladys? Three Mile Island stew? Valdez halibut? Tripes à la mode de Chernobyl?
Binge watching Breaking Bad, again honey?
If you're going to act like that, then stop cooking beans as a side every night
All I said last night was it needed a little salt.
I feel like you've been really closed off lately.
Are you sure it's not too much trouble?
Whipping up a little something to go?
Careful.
I think Dr. Goldberg will see this as progress. Your aggression is finally becoming less passive.
The moment when Fred realized his wife had watched too much Breaking Bad.
Is this menopause?
The atmosphere around here is toxic.
No matter how many alternative facts you offer, it's not an apron and it still stinks.
Plutonium Paella tonight?
Word of Trump's "nuclear option" seems to have affected you and me differently.
You signed up to help Elon Musk colonize Mars? I guess asking for a divorce like a normal person was out of the question.
Is cooking really that much like sex for you?
Perhaps, I need to be more sensitive to your cooking allergy.
I've got your hazardous material right here.
The EPA cuts haven't even taken effect yet.
See, now we're both OK that wine makes me gassy.
So then Bob says, "You're going to have to get HR to sign off on that." You should have seen the look Jessica shot him.
Somethings different. Did you change your hair style ?
Maybe you want to slip into something more comfortable?
Have you been living in a vacuum or something?
Making the Chernobyl recipe ?
Is my goose cooked yet?
Honey, it's just gluten.
Honey,it's just bacon.
Should I be worried that you're bringing work home with you again?
That sure smells "out of this world".
I'm pretty sure you can't just tell Venus immigration that you're from there, but what do I know, I'm from Mars.
Would you prefer wine or lower oxygen levels?
Have you ever considered just buying cat food?
Is that a new outfit?
You know... You shouldn't feel obliged to use every Williams-Sonoma gift card Lisa and Eric give us.
"Mmm, my favorite - stuffed mushroom clouds".
So, who are these guests again?
That's not the way Mother made it.
Another haz-mat special tonight dear?
All I said, dear, was, "Would it kill you to cook some liver with tofu?"
Come on! I don't fart THAT much!
Esther, darling, we're Reform Jews. You don't need to wear that outfit every time you cook bacon for me.
Next time I'll buy organic.
No. I'm not flattering you. You really look out of this world.
We could just move to Canada; we don't have to leave the planet.
I get that you need your 'space', but this is ridiculous.
Next time, let's skip the onions.
You're still on that molecular gastronomy kick?
Mmmm, that smells out of this world!
So...... Am I too late to chop the onions ?
Point made; I promise to buy some BEANO today.
Have a drink. We still have at least a few weeks before the changes in the EPA kick in.
You know, they've recently engineered a smokeless bacon.
That's one small meal for a man.
In the kitchen, no one can hear you scream "over easy."
Well, sometimes I need space too.
What happens when you sneeze?
Little heavy on the garlic, don't ya think?
I believe it's OK if vegetarians smell pork chops.
What have you learned from your Breaking Bad binge?
I'm sorry. I take it back. You don't breathe too loudly.
