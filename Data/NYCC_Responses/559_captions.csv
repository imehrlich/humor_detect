I can't believe my eye!

Good Riddance, Mankoff, you fancy bastard.

Let's just shoot the next one.

He is part of our catch and release program.

Perfect execution.

I think Long John just earned the silver.

I'll be even more annoyed if he can swim.

At least his execution is flawless.

I think we just shoot them from now on

O.K., that's it! We're going back to cruel and unusual!

I said prepare to die, not prepare to dive!

Beautiful execution.

Very bad dive. Very bad. If I walked the plank it would be much better. It would be the best plank walk. He's a loser at dying. Sad. Very sad.

If he adds a twist and nails the entry, I say we fish him out again.

And that, me boys, is grace under pressure.

I'm going to miss his optimism.

Talk about a perfect execution.

Nice dive. Now lets see if he can swim 2,000 miles.

Another flawless execution!

I like to call this the elimination round.

Technically, he's flawless, but I'm still deducting 2 points for mutiny.

Great execution.

Superb execution.

You know, that's exactly the kind of attitude that made this necessary in the first place.

Outstanding execution.

He's taking it better than I expected.

Nobody walks anymore.

"Who told him to take a flying leap"?

Sometimes you don't really get to know someone until it's too late.

They don't call him Jolly Roger for nothing.

I guess when we go low, he goes high.

That's going overboard.

Brilliant execution!

It's about the journey, not the destination.

'That, me hearties, is panache."

Nice execution!

That's the last time we raid a Cirque du Soleil cruise.

You can always tell the ones from Penzance.

Now that's what I call a perfect execution.

Now, that's a perfect execution.

Well, that's a perfect execution!

That's going a bit overboard.

I'll give him a 10 for execution.

Oh, to have two legs again.

He always had a flair for execution.

This is the last time we take over a ship from Cirque du Soleil.

Definitely from Penzance

His execution was perfect!

Sort of takes the fun out of it.

He's gone a little overboard.

I hope he knows we've run aground.

On the other hand, I'll miss his sense of humor.

Argh! A perfect execution!

Gotta be from Penzance.

I don't think this is his first time.

Truth be told, boys, I don't think he ever really self-identified as a pirate.

His private diving lessons cost me an arm and a leg.

Talk about going overboard.

His execution was a 10.

Jolly Roger...to the end.

That's exactly why I want him out of here.

And that's why we had to get rid of him.

You gotta hand it to him. He lives in the moment.

I asked for a CANNONBALL!

Ten for execution.

It's all in the execution.

He takes all the fun out of torture.

Does anyone else think he is going a little overboard?

Given the circumstances, he is taking it quite well.

Too bad he's discovered this talent so late in life.

He's taking all the fun out of this for me.

Beautifully executed.

Now, that's what I call execution.

He gets a 10 on his execution.

He takes all the fun out of it.

Oh now he shows some enthusiasm for the job.

He's just ok. You should have seen me when I had both legs.

He thinks he's being clever--but he doesn't realize we ran aground last night.

The French always have to be so damned dramatic!

Now that's what I call a glass half full guy.

A little overboard, no?

Even more insubordination!

That's what's called going out in style.

That is not what I meant by execution.

I love when we capture one of the Cirque du Soleil guys

Well, I give him a 10 for execution.

I think he went a little overboard.

If either of you say, 'Nice arrrrrrc' you're next.

Such graceful execution!

It's his swan song.

Oh, sure, NOW you make an effort!

I try not to judge

If it helps, that's a ten.

I always feel robbed by the few who embrace their destiny.

It's a shame that we've run aground.

It all comes down to execution.

I was expecting a cannonball.

Aye. He was a thief, but he sure had style.

But can he do a cannonball?

Some guys like to go out with a splash.

Now THAT'S overboard!

Well, he always said he'd make a big splash!

This is his way of going out in style.

Methinks he's done this before!

If he nails the entry, I'll call it a 10.

You can tell he's done a lot of planks.

Looks like he'll nail the entry, but let's see how he does on the exit.

Somehow, we didn't reach that guy.

Now I remember. Canon ball. We forgot the canon ball.

This happened on the Bounty, too.

Bloody exhibitionist!

He's really going overboard with these dives.

Enjoy your spring break!

feet together....toes pointed.....should score well

I just love watching them walk the springboard.

Bloody 'ell! A swan dive!? Lads, in my day, the intrepid hero woulda done a double reverse somersault to escape...

Great form â€“ a 9.8 for execution.

What a Swan Song.

I'm sorry, the difficulty just isn't there.

This is nothing compared to the dives he comes out of when on shore.

Wow..I give it a 9 and a hook...

Some people have all the fun.

Cognitive dissonance?

Beat Smee

I give him a 9.5!

Davy Jones finally got to use the gym clothes in his locker.

I see we're off to a flying start.

Keep an eye on him matey, I don't like the looks of this.

Did he just say his pronoun is 'wheeeee'?

Yeah, but can he carry a large sword when he does it??

He dove off the plank. I told you he was tired of hearing about Trump, we've got to talk about something else.

Arrgh, it's the Olympic death spiral!

I just remember, I've got extra tickets to Cirque du Soleil.

Arrghh..he puts a buckle in me swash!

I said flying jib, not flying jump.

I hope the whales like plankton.

Ugly Duck is simply performing his swan song.

That was my car.
