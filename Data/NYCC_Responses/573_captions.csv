It's the Heineken maneuver.
I have a hunch I'm in the placebo group.
My blood alcohol was dangerously low.
I have no idea, but it was the only thing TrumpCare would pay for.
You have to leave now. Visiting hours are over and happy hours are starting.
They say I should be up and staggering around in a day or two.
You don't want to know about the catheter.
We're going to need a bigger bedpan.
Yes my doctor was in my fraternity - what's your point?
Doc said two Pils every four hours.
I said, "Give it to me straight, Doc"
I've been told to keep my spirits up.
It's the new Trumpcare. It won't cure me but at least now I don't give a damn.
It's suprisingly good for hospital beer.

The ale for what cures you.
This is what happens when you're admitted to a university hospital on the weekend.
Thank goodness for the Affordable Beer Act.
Blue Ribbon, Blue Shield ... It all sounded the same when I signed up for health care.

Things are different with Trumpcare.
It's the only treatment covered by my insurance.
They said my blood type is Bud positive.
The doctor said to live it up while I still have insurance.
Well, they said 'nothing by mouth.' What else was I to do?
I miss Obamacare...
Doctor said I was down a couple of pints.
I'll be up and walking soon, but not in a straight line.
Please tell me there are salted peanuts in that bag
Trust me, we're getting a second opinion.
It's not like I'm driving.
The left arm is less filling. The right arm tastes great.
My HMO is an IPA.
Luckily I talked them out of an enema!
I think I better stay another night, dear, just to be safe.
The Republicans idea of anesthesia...cheap and accesible.
When they're empty I get ten cents off my hospital bill.
They say he's the best beer, nose and throat doctor around.
Unfortunately, our health insurance plan only reimburses for domestic.
Well, technically, these are fluids.
Trumped up, trickle down healthcare
I made it into the IV league.
I'm getting the IV League treatment.
The remedy is way better than the disease, believe me.
My spirits are fine...why do you ask?
The nurse asked me how I was doing, and I said I could really use a couple of beers.

Medical marijuana is so 2015.
Now, this is what I call IV league treatment!
It's a little more hoppy than my last IV.
It's not care exactly, but it is affordable.
I went with the Paul Ryan form of cheap anesthesia.
They gave me a choice of IVs and I went for the microbrew.
The barber says it's time to lower my beers.
Meds in beds? Booze in twos? This IV is what I choose.
I thought if I asked a bunch of questions I'd look stupid.

It's a Bud transfusion.
I've moved on to Buschcare.
Even intravenously, Miller Lite tastes awful.
It makes visiting hours more tolerable

I just found out my insurance doesn't cover anesthesia
You should see what the catheter looks like.
Remember? We switched from Kaiser to Budweiser.
Blue Cross? No, Blue Ribbon.
The HMO won't pay for the pain medication, so they're just going to keep me drunk.
