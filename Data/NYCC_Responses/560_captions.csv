That's Bob Mankoff. He used to be the cartoon editor of the New Yorker.
He got the cave but she got the wheel and the fire.
He got the man cave in the divorce.
I couldn't afford that place if I lived to be 30.
So this is how the 1% live.
I invented fire. He invested in it.
She left him for a guy with wheels.
It makes our place look like a pit.
It looks pricey - they have a doorman.
He comes from prehistoric money.
I knew he'd cave!
I never thought of digging sideways...
Why can't I have a man cave?
Wait til the bear wakes up.
He drew on the walls so we're keeping the security deposit.
Do you think your Dad's been waiting there all night?
Sure our place is a pit, but his is a hole in the wall.
Should we tell him about the bear?
He'll be there forever. It's rent controlled.
He had a place like ours, but people kept dropping in.
I told you we had the instructions upside down!
He may be on to something. He looks dry.
And I heard the kitchen has granite counter tops.
He just came out as homo sapien
The artists move in, the rents go up, and we end up living in some hole.
Getting past the guard is easy. How do we remove the paintings?
His place really is a hole in the wall.
He says he's "waiting for inspiration" but I think he's just gonna paint another bison.
You know what? "Cave Man" does have a better ring to it than "Hole Man"...
No, THIS is a manhole. That's a man cave.
He'll never move. It's rent-controlled.
The real fun starts when the bear wakes up!
We've got to move out of your parents' basement.
Very nice. Makes our place look like a hole in the ground.
He'll never leave, it's rent controlled.
We'll see who's laughing when the bears come back
Oh great, another art gallery opened.
Sure, caves are great until the bears come home.
It's nice, I guess... if you don't mind living in a hole in the wall.
I heard his wife left him for some big wheel inventor.
He also has a cave in the Hamptons.
Sure, he's smug now, but wait until the bear comes back!
Don't expect him to leave anytime soon. That cave is rent controlled.
He'll never leave, it's rent controlled.
I never thought that I would envy a hole in the wall.
I can't believe I hate the hole thing.
Nice space, but his roommate's an animal.
One day we will invent a word for a place where a man goes to be alone with his stuff.
It looks comfy now but just wait until the bear comes back.
Just look at him, staring at his cave wall painting, trying to think of a caption. What an IDIOT!
So this is how the one percent live!
He won't be so smug when the sabre-toothed tiger returns from vacation.
I prefer our skylight.
Yeah, but we have more light.
She got the wheel and fire. All he got was the cave.
I wouldn't live there in a million years.
The only difference is when it rains.
"I knew him before he invented fire".
This should be fun. He’s never seen a woman.
It looks nice now, but give it a couple of months and the walls will be covered with graffiti.
I don’t like the way he draws you on the wall.
Personally, I'm not a big fan of modern architecture.
I don't understand what you see in it. It is just a hole in the wall.
His name is Mankoff. He drew all of those pictures on the cave wall. Been there since before the dinosaurs, so they say.
Uh-oh, looks like your Dad is waiting up!
Why would anyone live in that hole in the wall?
That isn't a "man-cave". It's a grizzly bear-cave. He'll soon be wishing he had a man-hole like us!
I just don't get modern architecture.
I'd yell "fire", but I don't think he knows what that is yet.
Ha! He had the blueprints sideways!
Hmm, horizontal. I think he's onto something.
Isn't that where the bear lives?
He's just in a foul mood because I said his drawings had repetitive themes.
True, but he has a lot more overhead.
Should we tell him about the bear at the back of his cave?
Great! Someone moved in upstairs.
Let's get the name of his architect.
What can I say? He got in on the ground floor.
No way. They're dark, stuffy, hard to clean, limited view and not in our price range.
Patience dear, this is just a starter hole.
So that's how you keep the rain out.
Sure he has a door, but we have a skylight.
He said we make him feel like a third wheel, whatever that means.
Think of the money we'd save on flood insurance.
He was featured in Better Caves & Rock Piles.
He has the place all to himself and I hear it's rent controlled.
We need to wait him out, it's rent controlled.
No hunting, no gathering. He just binge-watches last season's cave murals.
Looks like a real hole-in-the-wall.
Keep dreaming; it's rent-controlled. He'll never move out!
Location, location, location.
You do realize we are hiding in the outhouse?
The one percent.
As soon as the bear comes back and eats him, the cave will be ours.
His flip went south when the bear moved in.
He feels like a third what?
N0 use waiting--looks like a rent controlled apt.!
So...that's how he stays dry when it rains.
What's next, cliff dwelling?
I guess he does know his ass from a hole in the ground.
I highly doubt "Cave Dweller" will become a thing.
Don't forget to walk upright when I introduce you. Dad is kind of racist.
This hole is greater than some of the parties.
Wait! How will your Dad even know if we're late for curfew if he can't tell time?
They say he was once a cartoon editor.
I'd better apologize. He DOES know his cave from a hole in the ground.
Location, location, location.
He gets over five hundred cave drawings and still complains there is nothing on.
I hear he's stepping down as cartoon editor of The New Yorker.
Look -- they got a doorman.
That seems like a lateral move.
Yet another architecture trend that will never last.
Well his Airbnb profile didn't lie, it is a hole in the wall.
It's new money.
You're right, I think that is Bob Mankoff!
Yeah, but there's no basement.
The original man cave.
I knew he'd eventually cave.
I've never seen a cave-man before ... this changes the hole-world.
Noah can explain better
This is just our Starter Hole.
Another McMansion blocking the view.
Sure, it's nice, but at least our hole's paid off.
Now, as soon as the cave bears show up, get ready to move in fast!
Gort meditates as cave bear awakens.
Maybe if you were better at hunting and gathering, we could afford a place like that.
Looks like a case of painter's block.
He's going to be insufferable the next time it rains.
We can get in. I know the bouncer.
Has he invited you inside to see his stupid wall etchings?
Just as I predicted......gentrification.
A horizontal hole in the ground! What will they think of next?
Well, I think the foyer is pretentious.
Yeah, like caveman is even a thing.
I'll admit his place is better in the rain.
A hole in the wall? Damn, that's clever.
"My Dad always waits up for me.".
C'mon Zork, help us dig for grubs. No one is ever going to care about your animal pictures.
He thinks caves are the future.
It's big, but he can't afford to heat it.
It's pretentious, it blocks our view and it complete;y destroys the character of the neighborhood.
He's always been a lateral thinker.
I heard she left after finding all the nude cave paintings...
How bad could it be? They have a doorman.
Another Neanderthal. There goes the neighborhood.
He's still mad I clubbed you first.
He says we'll get what he means when the rains come.
What's he do with all that space?
Yeah, he's between a rock and a hard place but look at the hole we've dug for ourselves.
What hole did he crawl out of?
Stupid Ogg. Hole go wrong way.
How does a hunter-gatherer afford the mortgage on a cave like that?
McMansion's are ruining the feel of the neighborhood.
It's got curb appeal, but I hate the wall art.
Remind me why we have to sleep in the guest room whenever you brother comes to visit.
I always wanted to live in a cave with a doorman.
What do you mean, 'We'll understand when it rains'?
I just love what he's done with the foyer.
Ever since he invented the wheel he's lived in luxury.
What could be in there that needs a bouncer?
It's Mankoff's new job guarding the cartoon bank.
I find you a hole, you want a cave. Will nothing make you happy?
How does a single, unemployed caveman afford a place like that?
At what point do we tell him it's just graffiti?
I hear he moved out of his parents' place to become a painter.
I'm telling you, 'Cave Man' is a fad. Hole Man is the future.
It's been one thing after another since he started walking upright.
OK Donald, break time is over. Now let's continue digging ourselves into this hole.
I don't think he understands hide and seek.
You're the one who wanted to live in the lower East side.
I used to think "hole in the wall" was a negative thing.
What's next? Fire?
See? Living in a hole-in-the-wall does not make one happier.
You should see the art work he's got in there.
He also paints.
The Dawn of Gentrification
Caveman does have a better ring to it than hole people
We need to dig a few more feet to get past security.
How did he get it to go sideways like that?
Gentrification.
Yeah, but at least ours has running water.
He'll never get this by the zoning board.
But is he happy?
It's just a hole in the wall.
So this is how the 1% live.
Caves are the new holes.
Did you see what he did to the walls? SO primitive.
The writing's on the wall.
You know, one of these days your father is going to notice this tunnel.
I hear he once was Caption Editor for the New Yorker.
I thought your lawyer said you were getting the house.
It seemed bigger on Airbnb
Its also rent controlled.
We should flip our hole.
I know he looks scary but the next restroom is like twelve caves away.
I can see them putting in those monstrosities all over town.
Oh, so now you're too good for the hole!
This doesn't look like China.
He wants to be first on the new subway.
He can't come, he's waiting for the cable guy.
I can't believe you dated that Neanderthal.
We can't move. Our place is rent controlled.
He says he doesn't want to be a hunter OR a gatherer.
Well... Cavebnb gave it great reviews..
All we said was that his drawings lack dimension.
See, I told you--a man cave.
Honey, we simply cant afford it.
Typical teenager, he just stays in his cave and watches fire all day.
He leads a sheltered life.
Someday we’ll get out of this hell hole and have a cave of our own.
That's how the one percent lives.
That Frank Lloyd. He just has to be different.
He has everything and he's still not happy.
It only works if the bear is already in the cave.
Guess what, now we'll be called Cavemen!
The doorman is a nice touch but the lobby art was a little too primitive.
I like his idea better.
I don't know--moving from a ground level flat to an apartment with a doorman is a big step.
Above ground is all the rage."
Must be nice to be part of the 1%.
Next year let's book early and try to get a place with a roof.
It's called moving up.
Why can’t your brother stay in the guest hole?
Technically, it's a man cavern.
We're a nation of caves and cave nots.
See - he calls it a roof. It's going to change everything.
See? I told you we were doing it wrong.
The idiot! He dug his burrow sideways!
Steals my idea, turns it on it's side, and now he's the architect.
He invented the wheel. Then he realized he had nowhere to go.
Man, I wish I'd thought of that.
Taking his structure horizontal is going to revolutionize the hole industry.
Zillow has it listed at 16.5 stones.
Doesn't your dad ever sleep?
Ooooo! CAVE artist! Well la-de-dah!
It's that less primitive than thou attitude that gets me.
Then you should have married him!
He doesn't know a cave from a hole in the ground.
It's a hole in the wall
He finally caved.
The very first man cave.
You can come out now, he's not president anymore
I love the new open floor plan!
We finally learn to walk erect, and he just sits there.
...and he insists that we call him a 'cave' man now.
Yea, I guess caveman has a better ring to it than holeman
Ok his hole is sideways. So what?
At least we have a pool.
I heard his wife left him for a more evolved man.
When did he get cable?
I think he might be on to something
Wow! what do you think his mortgage is ....
He might be on to something there.
Tell your dad, it's just till we get back on our feet.
Oh, great! Now, our property taxes will skyrocket!
Look how the other one third lives.
Why didn't WE think of that?
Classic blunder: He bought the most expensive home in the neighborhood.
And I'll bet it doesn't fill up with water when it rains.
Yeah it's big, but the mortgage must be a tusk and a leg.
He's living way beyond his means. But let's be honest, we're in the hole ourselves.
Must be nice to be in the one %.
It's the home of the future!
They added security since we moved.
For an Early Man, your dad stays up pretty late.
It's still just a hole, dear.
I can see the advantages in the rainy season.
I think we may have overlooked some of the charms of the hole in the wall.
He'll miss the sound of the rain thumping off his forehead.
Stop moping and join us in the Jacuzzi.
We need a cave and you need a toilet, let's work this out!
That would be better when it rains...
I think troglodytes sit down and troglomytes stand up.
Horizontal? I never thought of that.
All that on a single income?
Out of our price range.
He said he was tired of always being the third wheel." What's a wheel?
He's got a point about rain.
Nice digs.
Nice digs.
So that's how the other 1% lives
Are we on the wrong side of history?
He hasn’t come out since the election.
And he called our place a hole.
The commutes not bad, and its a doorman building.
Dig horizontally!? Who would'a thunk it?
He thinks he is evolving.
I like the idea. The stairs are killing me.
Fred needs his man cave like I need a hole in the ground.
She left him for a guy with a fire pit.
I said, "Hold your ground," but he caved.
Horizontal. Clever.
So by digging horizontally you get more floor area.
He's depressed because I told him his drawings were primitive and never would stand the test of time.
Ground level--that's very important
He can call it a foyer all he wants. Still smells like bear's ass.
That's what I want when I retire. A place out of the weather where I can paint.
Neighborhood is going to hell with all these McCaves.
That wheel endeavor must've paid off.
Someday, honey, we'll live like the 1%.
So that's a Man Cave...Nice
Third Wheel? What's a wheel?
Gentrification.
Two or three raindrops and he caves.
Just don't say 'fire in the hole' again!
Can we afford a doorman building?
Looks like we have a squatter.
He's in line for tickets to Hamilton. It opens in 500,000 years.
Ya, that man cave is nice, but I'd rather be here, holed up with you babe.
We should have used his architect.
I know it's just a hole-in-the-wall. It's still nicer than ours.
First the wheel, now this
Can you imagine what the taxes and utilities would be on a place like that?
I'm sorry, but there's such a thing as too much house.
You know, he may have a point.
How can he afford that place?
I'm starting to think that maybe we bought the wrong unit.
How come he gets a man cave and I only get a man hole?
How can anyone live like that?
He's watching the paint dry.
He's been like this since the dawn of time.
It's rent-controlled, too.
Whatever he calls it, it's still a hole!
See? If we dig the hole sideways, we won't get wet!
Since inventing fire, he's become quite arrogant.
His place is a hole in the wall.
He calls the place Mar-a- Cavo
Is this China?
Yeah, but what about wind from the south? Ever think about that? And the lack of overhead light? And the lousy feng shui? And the ...
Yeah, but ours is rent controlled.
Wow, did we ever use the wrong architect!
After the divorce he just caved.
Damn, there's going to be a cover charge to get in.
I like the flow of his foyer.
"First fire, and now the sideways hole--what'll they think of next?
We'd live like that if we weren't in the hole.
You lure him out and I'll build a door.
What's next? Fire?
He's just sulking-- his patent on fire was refused.
He caved.
Can you believe that only six months ago that guy was president of the United States!?
Apparently Kevin is neither a hunter nor a gatherer.
Not exactly a hole in the ground is it?
The first man cave.
It still has outdoor plumbing
I want a man cave, too!
He hasn't moved since she left him for that Neanderthal.
He just finished the buffalo painting, but now his wife wants antelopes.
I fear the era of the holeman is over.
You think we'll ever be able to afford a place like that?
Horizontalists think they're so smart.
A critic said his paintings were derivative.
Maybe downsizing wasn't such a great idea.
Tunnel of love, my ass!
There he goes again, perpetuating the stereotype.
Apparently the light at the end of the tunnel is overrated.
Let him be. He's pondering his health care options.
I like the open concept.
I told you there'd be less border control at the north entrance
I'm worried too. He refuses to hunt and gather.
How can he afford it on one income?
It was a nasty divorce but he got the house."
Yo is this China ?
Wow! So that's how the One Percent live!
How'd he get it sideways?
I wish we could afford a door man in our building.
These stakeouts would be more fun if someone invented doughnuts.
Don't you just love mid-paleozoic modern?
I'm worried...he hardly ever moves since he installed that big screen cave drawing.
We didn't dig far enough. The paintings are in the back of the cave.
Damn one-percenter!
Lucy left him
It's really only half a hole, when you think about it.
He worked for the New Yorker.
I'm starting to wonder if our mortgage is sub-prime.
Great. He'll probably make it all cozy by painting some animals on the walls next.
And that's the penthouse.
I think we might not have followed the blueprints correctly.
Hi. We're your new neighbors and we're having a little hole warming.
He's our new financial adviser that's going to get us out of the hole.
He calls it a man-cave. Says it's much more swanky than my man-hole.
True, but ours is in Brooklyn
He got it in the divorce but he'll never be able to afford it.
I have to admit. It has a better ring to it than Hole in the Dirt Man.
How do you swing a place like that on just the one salary?
So this is China?
I can't believe he sits there all day and watches re-runs of the big hunt.
We earn twice as much, but look at the hole we live in.
Sure, we live in a hole, but he lives under a rock.
"You know what, I think he may be on to something"!
He claims it is cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter.
You know, he might be onto something.
He said he's waiting for the light at the end of the tunnel.
Yes, I know they are fundamentally the same, but a cave has a roof.
Well, dream on. You know we can't afford a place like that.
If he sees his shadow, it's another year of no evolution.
Ogg always did think outside of the hole.
Yeah, it's huge. But conspicuous wealth doesn't mean he's happy.
I always thought Ugguz was a bit of a Neanderthal, but you gotta hand it to him for figuring out the rain thing
Ok, so better in the rain, but it looks like a lot more to clean.
Ugh. Another luxury high-rise.
He's figuring out how to install Windows.
Gentrification is killing this neighborhood.
So this is China?
How can he afford that place?
How can he afford a one-bedroom?
I think he is going to post on his wall.
It's called a "hot tub", Og. Just change into your bathing pelt and join us.
We'd never get past the doorman.
The location is a real hole in the wall.
Maybe you shouldn't have said his place was a hole in the wall.
Come back into the jacuzzi, frank
I know it looks like he has it all but he's a real Neanderthal.
Ugh it's even got a doorman.
I think he is waiting for the cable guy.
The hole isn't good enough for him. He's calling himself a 'Caveman' now.
So that's what retired cartoon editors do.
'Alternative fact' or not, this is a hole, not a guest room.
Don't you think it is a bit too post-modern?
The broker said we bought a trendy, minimalist vertical concept cave. Bit I'm starting to think we are just standing in a hole.
But the agent said, ‘Sunken living rooms are in, and caves are so 10,000 B.C.’
Those one-percenters really know how to live. . .
As soon as we pay off our student loans, honey.
Nobody came to his cavewarming.
I'll admit it does have curb appeal
I knew he'd cave!
I've had it, Sheila...tonight your brother gets the guest room.
First he sulks, then he tweets about it.
Yeah, but he doesn't have a skylight.
He still can't believe that she left him for a rock star!
Sure, it's nice. But the taxes must be enormous.
Look! A horizontal home!
Boring stuff. Hunting scenes, mostly. Nobody pays any attention. Nobody is every going to pay attention.
We can take him. We have tools.
He called our place a hole.
Just wait for the property tax.
Oh, I see. You dig horizontally, not vertically.
I'm not impressed; it's just a hole in the wall.
Relax. This was a good investment. Horizontal holes are only a fad.
Hmm. Fletcher may be on to something with his horizontal hole.
He said his man cave has a better ring to it than our man hole.
Man cave?
That's the dream.
I hear he put granite countertops in his kitchen.
Damn! Another toll.
It has recessed torches too.
Hal, call me shallow, but I'm leaving you.
He's part of the top one percent."
Look at Mr. Fancy.
But..., how does he keep the rain in?
He is waiting for some guy named Godot.
Just think of ours as a fixer-upper.
He's been like that ever since GEICO let him go.
I'd hate to live in a hole in the wall like that.
I feel like a Neanderthal at these gallery events.
Oh great ! Now our property taxes will go up.
It's crazy, two years ago I could have had that cave for a wooly mammoth leg and saber tooth tiger tail. Now? You can't touch that for less than eight giant sloths and a cave bear.
He has his strengths, but hide and seek isn't one of them.
If we save our rocks, honey, we could afford a cave like that.
Ostentatious and impractical - plus he barely gets any natural light in there.
Sideways--not down--whoda thunk it?
So that's where Letterman is living these days!
I don't think your father likes me.
This neighborhood is gentrifying too fast.
While his design is derivative; he has managed to improve functionality without sacrificing the classic aesthetic of a hole.
Is Gerald watching the cave drawings again?
How do you know we're not the Neanderthals?
This is the last time we pay for orchestra seats.
Compared to that, I feel like we are living in a hole.
I think they call it a man cave.
I can't believe he got the house.
What a Neanderthal.
Pardon us, would you have any Grey Poupon?
Well I guess it IS better when it rains...
A caveman in a cave, what a cliché.
How could someone live like that?
Makes our place just seem like a dirty little hole, doesn't it?
Ever since he got that new flat screen painting, it's been hard to get Grog out of the cave.
Alright, fine - cave'person'.
You know what they say about men with big caves.
Well, I guess it would be better when it rains.
Love it or list it?
Those high rises are going to ruin the neighborhood.
Yes, but he doesn't have a pool in the rainy season, like we do.
I told you if we dug in he would cave.
What did he mean by 'Third Wheel'?
Says he has an idea for something called a "wheel."
If there's an earthquake before it rains, we win.
This doesn't look like China.
He may have gotten the house but the latrine is ours!
He's clearly overcompensating for something
You know, he might be be on to something. Besides, "Caveman" has better ring to it than "Holeman".
How does he live in that hole in the wall?
Yeah, but what woman is going to live in that hole in the wall?
And that's where he gets all his news.
His wife ran off with a Homo sapiens
I’ve got to admit, his horizontal hole is a good idea. But did you see his stupid plan for a round wheel?
I guess no one came to his hieroglyphics opening.
His time share with the bear is really working out.
Nobody came to his cavewarming.
You shouldn’t have insulted his paintings.
He calls it is man cave. I say what's wrong with the man hole?
The cave goes quick on Airbnb.
Seriously, he can't stay in that cave forever. I'm sure Bob Mankoff's replacement will use him in the next cartoon!
I hate early adopters.
I always knew he'd cave.
Now that he has invented the wheel, he barely talks to us anymore.
Cave dwelling is just a fad.
You distract him and I 'll grab the art
He calls it cave dwelling. It'll never catch on.
Horizontal? Hell, that'll never catch on!
Some day we'll be able to afford a place like that.
He just saw his mom without her fig leaf.
Come back into the hot tub, Bob. I promise, no more bubbles!
Told you it was a real hole in the wall.
Another one of those obnoxious McMansions.
I still say drop-in is better than walk-in.
Sure it's got some advantages but its way too ostentatious for my taste.
You're the one who wanted a tiny house
Oh dear, do we have the wrong night?
At least he's got a roof over his head.
One day the cavemen and the holemen will be friends. One day.
Did they have to put a holeless shelter in our neighborhood?
It's a new group. Call themselves CAVEMEN.
It's just a hole in the wall, but all the locals go there.
Yes, his frontal lobe is larger and he dwells above ground, but is he really happy?
I hate these new high-rises.
He thinks we bring six weeks more of winter.
can' t wait to get out of this basement apartment.
What is he doing home? I thought you said he was out hunting and gathering.
He's still afraid of the basement.
There's still two more weeks of winter.
He's invited me to come see his etchings.
Horizontal! Of course. It makes so much more sense.
I still think "holeman" is catchier.
He won"t be smiling when the 9:15 comes through.
You're expecting Punxsutawney Phil, maybe?
See! Having a better home doesn't necessarily make you happier!
Your divorce lawyer stinks.
Damn it, one more McMansion!
I promise you honey, one day we will live horizontally
He's a one-percenter. Made a fortune in pointy sticks.
It's a step up.
Life after Trump.
They used to call it Trump Tower
Uh oh. Gentrification.
We don't want to be the first to show up.
Sure, he's dry. So are the bears.
I won't let him go clubbing.
Another McMansion in the neighborhood...
Yeah, well, the laugh will be on him when he has to get that roof replaced.
She took absolutely everything when she left him.
Oh great, the first silent treatment.
This "man cave" thing won't last.
Why do so suppose he turned his hole on it's side?
So this is where he thinks up fake news.
Yeah it's nice but I'd hate to be the one who had to clean it.
So this is how the other half lives!
That's it!: We have to make the hole go sideways!
Location, location, location...I told you we should have made a counter offer.
That's not new! That's just a sideways hole!
It's dark and weird, but it does have the advantage of not filling up with water every time it rains.
I tried to tell him it's fake news, but he just keeps staring at the wall.
You distract the guard, I'll steal the cave painting.
It's a fad.
You know.......he was right. Digging horizontally would have worked better.
He never could dig a decent hole.
I told you we should have used our points for the upgrade.
Magnon's a master of Paleolithic minimalism.
THAT's evolved? Honey, it's basically a sideways hole.
They really shouldn't have taken his Twitter account away!
It'll never catch on. I give it a year tops.
He's been that way ever since the election.
Keep digging. Another 20 feet and we'll have invented the basement.
He's never gonna move, it's rent stabilized and granite everything.
Oh, great. Now we’ll be known as “cavemen” for the rest of time.
I don't get it. How's he gonna get rained and snowed on?
No curb appeal, keep digging.
Don't get him started on his cave paintings.
But when it rains we have a pool, and he still just has a cave.
He can't decide between the stone or granite.
He gets all his information about the world from watching cave paintings.
We may not have any walls, but we're not talking to any either!
The commutes a little rugged, but its a doorman building!
It's depressing to see how quickly the neighborhood is being gentrified.
I did not know the penthouse was also on the market .
The horizontal cave. Brilliant. And we thought his wheel was something.
Yeah, sure it looks nice, but the maintenance costs would kill us.
So that's the guy that got the penthouse.
He won't say a word. He thinks his cave is tapped.
Oh crap, I hope he’s not checking for IDs.
Horizontal holes will never catch on.
He calls it his "man cave"

I thought he said he was building a wall.
Man caves aren't everything they're cracked up to be.
He's still hasn't got over Wilma leaving him.

Just tell him our names are on the list.
I hate using the hot tub when others are waiting.
I think it's clearly oversized for the neighborhood.
I don't know how he can afford the rent.
He hasn't been the same after he came out from under the rock
If we work hard enough, and sell this place for a decent amount, that could be us someday.
he bought before the crash
See, the rich really are different!
You said he'd be hunting until Friday.
How again are we going to steal cave art?
I wonder when the rest of Congress will arrive.
Those McMansions are ruining the neighborhood.
someday gloria, someday....
Gentrification is going to force us out of the neighborhood.
I'll ask the doorman if they have any vacancies.
Who the hell told him he could live in our garage?
Doomsday prepping is just a fad, Honey.
Moving into a tiny home was the best decision we've made.
He says he’ll make this cave great again.
He'll cave in.
Only if he throws the paintings in.
You know, it is easier getting in and out.
So that's how the other half lives.
Maybe we should have gone for a highrise too.
They’ll never call me a ‘cave’ man.
He's binge watching ...he hasn't moved in three hours.
Why can't I have a man cave?
Keep your damn man cave; we've got a wine cellar.
Nice. But I don't want a walkup.
The cave market is a total bubble
The 1% may live better, but are they really any happier?
Let him sulk as long as he wants. He DID NOT invent the hole.
...And this is the safe house for The Oscars Accountant.
There's less over head in the outer burrows.
No woman to annoy him, plenty of room...I'd call it a man cave.

I still say our vertical cave has better feng shui.
In retrospect, I suppose that a horizontal cave may have certain advantages over a vertical one.
"Do you think this man cave thing is going to catch on"??
He may have a window, but we have a skylight.
I assume that's the infamous man cave?
"He doesn't know us from a hole in the ground".
Well, look who's showing off his frickin' high-rise pied-a-terre!
I told you he'd cave first.
The genesis of gentrification
His place is nice, sure, but at least ours is paid off.

Also deported due to an existing pre-historic condition.
Mankoff needs a new hobby.
He has his own man cave and he still isn't happy.
I knew he’d cave eventually.
Just think, someday we could live in a home like that.
Somehow he picked that hole up and attached it to the side of the hill!
I got him to cave in.
Maybe he's pissed because the New Yorker cartoon web site never works as it should!
Yeah it's nice, but there's no garage!
On second thought, we should have just asked him what he's using this hole for.
He caved quickly.
But it doesn't collect rainwater.
Maybe he's right. Maybe our place really is a hole in the ground.
Sometimes he can be such a Neanderthal.
If this is China it looks very familiar.
Just wait and see, a roof will cause cancer.
What kind of loser would buy a place with such limited views?
"Horizontal! Brilliant!
He dwells too much.
Great, there's only one guy ahead of us.
We need a new real estate agent.
I thought for sure he would cave.
Here we have the allegory of the cable TV news cycle and yes, that is our president.
Smug, pseudo neanderthal, thinks he's better than us
I would not live there. It's a real hole in a wall.
Why does it get a man cave when we just get a manhole ?
I could never live in a high-rise.
We definitely need to renovate.
I always confused concave and convex.
Just because he's in the oval office doesn't make him any less of a Neanderthal.
Maybe we should have called first.
Honey, I guarantee you he used a realtor.
I knew we should have bought when the housing market was good.
He said we didn't know a cave from a hole in the ground.
Some day we'll be able to move out of this hole-in-the-ground into a more cavernous place.
I don't get it. If he's a cave man, what does that make us?
I'm thinking that the sideways approach is better.
I'm sick of him treating us like gophers.
He's waiting for the doorbell to be invented.
That my dear is a penthouse.

Maybe we shouldn't have said three is a crowd.
I guess he just got tired of being called Hole Man.
We need to find him a woman. Not a single painting in his cave.
Honey, can I get a man cave too?
I have no idea how a guy like that can afford a cave.
He's smug now, but it will never catch on!
He's been stuck between that rock and a hard place all week.
I don't think this is China
I'd like to leave the hole, too, but we've got rent control.
Well Og, I guess no one likes to feel like the third...hey that gives me an idea!
I have no idea how he can afford that place.
Looks like we need to find ourselves a new realtor!
Ugh, the one percent.

If he only knew there was light at the end of the tunnel.
He's in a time-out.

How do you suppose he dug that?
i wonder if he'll sublet.
I want one of those
Imagine, no possessions...
This is his idea of a guest house?
Just what this neighborhood needs -- another hole in the wall joint.
So that's how the other half lives.
What with the divorce and his kids off at college, you'd think he'd downsize.
The security system looks primitive
Well, at least we have each other.
I should have majored in Finance instead of History
How were we supposed to know, we've been living under a rock!
He calls himself a 'Cave Man'.
You think he'll sublet?
This is how it begins...gentrificavetion.
This game may take a while given none of us know how to count.
I have to pee.
Buyer's remorse.
He's defying the cave bear just to make a point.
That idiot thinks he's Plato.
A high rise....do you think it will catch on?
Sure, hon, he's in the one percent, but we have each other.
Honey, trust me, it may look nice but it's a real hole in the wall.
I worry about him, Margaret. Since he lost his job all he ever does is sit at home watching cave paintings.
Doorman building
Should we invite him to go to China with us?
We're not keeping up.
Well, yeah. But then we'd have to move uptown.
He got tired of folks just dropping in.
You'd think he'd be a little happier. He definitely had the better lawyer.

He's been refusing to use the hole ever since it became transgender
Needs a stuffed mammoth head and a neon beer sign.

It's all a matter of perspective.
It's the newest concept. It's called a man-cave.
The realtor says he might be wiling to rent.
So that's what they call a staycation!
If he's a "caveman," what does that make us?
Well, he's right it would solve the rain problem...
I just wish we could get him to try eHarmony.
I envy his upward mobility
He inherited it from his father!
Arches are so passé.
It must be rent controlled. There's no other way he could afford to live there as a bachelor.

Do you think he's pro or con cave?
He refers to it as his "man cave."
I'll jump him while you take down the listing on CaveFinder.

Yeah but he gets to go to Mar-a-Lago on weekends!
Well I think the location is better, but I don't like the looks of that doorman.
"He spends all day there drawing pictures of his pets on the wall".
It'll never catch on.
He's been so moody since he went paleo.
You watch, they'll come up with a term like "cave man" for the earliest humans; "hole couples" won't even make the list.
Our GPS is just a tiny bit off..
He got upset when I told him that there is no future in cave painting.

I didn't expect there to be a cover charge.
Leave him alone. He'll come out of his cave one day.
If your husband sees us, our hole relationship is over.
Nice! ...but could we afford it?
I most certainly did not dig in the wrong direction.
Once again, we're in the hole, while Mr. High and Mighty is living in the lap of luxury.
Yes, close to subway, with doorman. But no concierge.
So far, I'm not impressed with AirBnB

What makes you think he has indoor plumbing?
Hey, some day soon you and I will have our dream hole in the wall.
Look, a literal man cave.
Sure, he's got a cave. But he's lonely.
He's been that way ever since GEICO laid him off.
Now this cave has been listed over 90 days, maybe throw out a lowball offer.
Nice curb appeal, but could be drafty.
Well, on the upside, we've invented the third wheel.
Do you think he knows we're not in our rooms.
It's on the first floor, but at least there's a doorman.

Your husband wasn't supposed to be back until the next Stone Age.
He's gone overground!
I think it's one of those new high-rises.

He had a better architect.
You know, he might be onto something.

Darn cavesteaders.
I tried talking to him, but he doesn't do that yet.
Wow! Check out the penthouse!
He's in a man cave alone; I'm in a man hole... with you
She got the mammoth.
Southern exposure, and no water in the basement.
Dry, sure, but I bet the cell reception is terrible.
It's easy to get a fancy cave if you live to the ripe old age of 30, but then you're too old to enjoy it.
He keeps insisting there's no bear.
Pssst...El Chapo...this way!

Caves? Nah, they'll never catch on.
Now that Glork's wife has left him, this place might come on the market.
Ours is affordable. His is market.

Somebody woke up on the wrong side of the cave.
That's one of those new prefab homes.
I could never stand to be cooped up like that.
He's still tweeting that the button he pushed said LUNCH instead of LAUNCH..
Gentrification is just killing our neighborhood.
He's already invented fire and the wheel, I'm sure he can come up with a way for us to get out of this hole.
Modern architects are so smug.
Well, so much for your China theory.
Isn’t it about time he hunted and gathered?
Our hole is rent-controlled.
Just what this neighborhood needs -- another cave.
I wonder if he's thinking about the days before America became great again.
He's watching jurassic park again.
He prefers a hole-in-the-wall.

He says he is not going to come out until the next election.
How much for that hole in the wall?
Just because he could put a dry roof over your head makes him a better man than me?
I feel like he might be onto something?
What's his problem? He's got way more space than we do.
He just found out that he's been living under a rock.
I guess he didn't find China either.
I see he went with the open door plan.
We may be in a starter hole now, but there is our future.

Aren't you proud that our son has moved up in the world?
He's watching reruns of the Flintstones.
We probably shouldn't have unfriended him
Living in a cave, what will they think of next?
It's just too long a stretch for him to see the light at the end of our tunnel.
Yes, it's strange, but at least his feet are dry.
Don't be fooled, He didn't earn that. It's all family money.
So that's what penthouse living is like.
At least we have a 360 degree view!
I warned him. Chicks don't dig caves.
What a hole in the wall... Maybe we should have him drop in?
Trust me, cave-dwelling is just a fad.
Yeah, he has more space with the horizontal design but it doesn't seem to have made him any happier.
Think he'll sell? This housing market is crazy.
Check out the convex arch.
It's nice, but he'll have to give it up once he's married.

He's struggling with his post-paleolithic style.
Hmm. Modern, yet functional.
I'm fine with fire and the wheel, but the invention of the bouncer is getting me down.
What a concept, a horizontal hole.
I can't help but feeling envious of those who own luxury holes
I don't know. It never occurred to me to live above ground.
When it's finished, this will be the 86th street stop.
Seems lightly guarded for such priceless art.
...and it's rent controlled.
Wait until the HOA hears about this...
At least WE know the difference between a tunnel and a hole in the ground!
He's got a mammoth case of writer's block.
If you can afford all that, I’m pretty sure you can afford to pay someone to clean it.
That's the trouble with modern architecture - No privacy.
So sad, Vlad left and still no Godot.
Maybe he's on to something.

One really is the loneliest number
These zoning variances are ruining the quaintly primitive nature of our community
He's so bourgeois.
We will just tell him the truth. We're his long lost cousins from the land down under.
If there's a light at the end of the tunnel, I can't see it
I'm going to have to kill 2 more dinosaurs a week before we can afford to live like THAT!
I told him a hole with two is just as good as a hole in one
Artist.
Ha! Above ground living never catch on.
Well, I'll be damned.
Bob's on a strict Paleo Diet, he can't even leave the cave.
Well yeah, it's a bit smelly, but just look at all the space! I'm told he even has his own private outhouse hole somewhere around here.
Look--it's the home we always wanted!
Nice man cave.
Trust us, horizontal caves are soo last century.

We definitely need to move up in the world.
I hate this now.

I told you not to mention politics.
It looks like another case of affluenza.
She gave him an ultimatum and he caved.

Bob's guest house isn't at all what I expected.
“We’re going to have write AIRBNB.
His "open concept" nonsense is as bad as his "wheel" and "fire".
That's Og Trump in his first high rise.
It's another one of his nutty alternative housing designs.
His hole isn't any holier than ours.
He's lucky because its under rent control.
His sideways hole design will never catch on.
Man cave, it will never catch on.
A concierge! Must be the new thing with these highrises
Caves are SO ten thousand years ago.

I'm thinking White Pickett Fence, what are you thinking?
Only one word to describe this Wilma, gentrification.
if he's waiting for the cows to come home, he's out of luck - they were delicious!
It's spacious, but I bet he's swimming in debt.
Make him an offer? Lets just bash 'im in the head and take the damned place.

He's better at hunting than hiding
I hate our condo association.
Nice guy, but he lives in a hole-in-the-wall.
Grog seems like a good neighbor, but I can't shake the feeling that he's looking down on us.
Maybe if we're nice he'll let us come over and watch his wall.
Think he's checking IDs?
Wow, and all the amenities that go with above-ground living!
Look at Homo Dejectus over there.
To me it looks just like another hole in the wall
His cave dwelling idea is definitely cutting edge.
Do we tell him about Plato?
Sure, bigger is nice, but then you have the commute.

What does he call that? A man cave.
Any other ideas besides tunneling past the guard?
That's El Chapo. He took a wrong turn in his latest tunnel.
They told him his work was derivative.
He just sits there reminiscing about the great, old stories on the cave painting wall. He hopes we can be great again.
I like our manhole better than his man cave.
He's sad because he saw his shadow.
No Mensa membership his future!
He's brooding. Let's invent the guitar and give it to him.

He's just a whiny monogamist.
This is my dream hole, but I love what the Joneses have done with their place.
Okay so ours is vertical and his is horizontal......big deal!

Some day we can live like that.
The Early mancave.
I thought that he'd be over the election by now.
Still don't know why he built so close to the property line.

So sad. Og's old lady kicked him out. He's calling it his man cave.
Stick with me baby! What's a roof when we are living on love?
He's mad because I told him it should be called person cave.
At least his place is a complete hole in the wall!
He must be the cave concierge.
His place is nice, but ours has an open layout.
Doesn't look like he's going to cave.
OK, you do the tease and get him out of the cave and I'll bop his head and we'll have the mansion!

He calls it his "Man Cave". Says that helps him to get closer to his feminine side!

Look at him, in that hole by himself. What a loser.
He'll be the doorman, when they invent doors.
I don't know what he has to complain about. Electorally speaking, his vote was worth more than ours.
I guess he is waiting for someone to come view his artworks.
Maybe next election they will change their immigration policy.
I hate those smug lateral cave digger types.
Should we invite him over?
Prehistoric prison break.
See? Money can't buy happiness.
Will we own a penthouse like that some day?
Look at the size of that place! You're lucky you don't have to keep house for him.
His name's Jones. Why do you ask?

I've never been a Cave Man."
it said "super host" on airbnb
Another twenty feet of digging, and we could have claimed squatter's rights!
Separate bathrooms, too?
It's his own fault really. She told him if he called it his man cave one more time she was out of that hole in the wall.
I'm just saying--if you're really serious about painting it gets a lot more light.
