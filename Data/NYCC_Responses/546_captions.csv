We never should have applauded.
What's happening on your side?
If we hadn't eaten Ted, he really would have enjoyed this.
Well, I like it more than their "ship on the horizon" gag.
OK. We have two wishes left.
l knew they were smart, but sarcastic?
Apparently their sense of irony is also highly evolved.
Very nice. Now do a boat.
I wish we'd brought food instead of LSD.
They're at it again. It's like they wait for you to go behind the tree.
There's smart, and then there's smartass.
Oh sure they're smart. It's the sarcasm I can't stand.
I knew they were smart. I didn't know they were sarcastic.
Remember how you said we were done talking unless one of three things happened?
That was great guys, now do a rescue boat.
They've captured the look, but not the mood.
Yes, it's art. But is it relevant?
Ironically, they have a very dry sense of humor.
I'm thinking now I probably should have just trained them to get help.
Almost there, but they haven't quite captured the melancholy.
It wasn't funny yesterday and it's not funny today.
Okay, that's pretty good. Now try "boat."
Martin... very slowly, pass me your iPhone.
I'm gonna do a split, just to mess with them.
Let's have sex and see what they do.
I'd always heard they were smart, but I never knew they were smart asses.
The one playing you is creeping me out
I don't care if it's the sincerest form of flattery, it's still obnoxious.
Impressive. Now, make a boat.
On the twenty-third day, Orson realized that the dolphins were not, in fact, trying to help.
Irony and sarcasm, sure signs of advanced intelligence.
It turns out the universal language isn't music. It's sarcasm.
The heartless bastards probably did this to Amelia Earhart, too.
It's not as impressive as it was 3 months ago.
I found seven of the differences -- but you say there are ten?
"Let's train the dolphins," you said. "It'll be fun," you said.
Excellent. Now, try "S.O.S."
Remember when I said I didn't think it could get any worse?
Well, it takes my mind off the election.
This proves it, mimes are annoying in any language.
Well done. Now, can you form the letters SOS?
I'll believe they're intelligent when I see something original.
I changed my mind. They are the kind you eat.
I have never hated performance art as much as I do right now.
I knew they were intelligent. I didn't know they were cruel.
Sure they're smart, but I could do without the sarcasm.
We're not the only ones who are bored.
When they form a lifeboat, let me know.
In hindsight, we probably should have trained them to form a boat
But is it art?
Although their intelligence is often documented, dolphins are less renowned for their satire.
Great form! Now do a raft.
I think they closed another Sea World.
How about we catch dinner after the show?
There's a fine line between playfulness and mockery.
Now if we could only get them to imitate a boat.
Choreography: ten. Empathy: zero.
I'll bet they get rescued before we do.
That little one has you absolutely nailed.
Well, that's the last of the acid.
Ok! Simon says "make a boat".
Now I really wish I had my phone.
Just stay on your side. You wasted your damn wish on the Dolphin Cheerleaders.
It’s a deal. You bring help and we promise to get you an audition.
Simon says "make a raft".
I know it was our last fish, but they deserved it!
These two may be the toughest crowd we've ever worked
It's either a brilliant commentary on man's loneliness, or payback for SeaWorld.
Well now they're just mocking us.
Nice. Now let's see your impression of a boat.
Gotta admit ... clever pod cast.
I don't care if it's the last coconut, I'm hurling it.
You know, it was kind of funny the first day...
Probably bottlenoses, definitely smart-asses.
Just think Bob, we'd have to pay for this back home...
I know I shouldn't have doubted their intelligence but now they're just showing off
I admire their intelligence; it's their vanity that offends me.
...not much, what do you see?
I'll give them points for style, but, overall, I think they failed to capture our air of desperation mingled with hopelessness.
Next time you send a message in a bottle, avoid mentioning that we are talent scouts.
Looks like another round of layoffs at Sea World
That's really nice. Can you make a boat next?
That's great-- now can you do a lifeboat?
If a millennial witnesses something miraculous, but can’t post to social media, did it ever happen?
If you see coconuts fall from the other palm tree don't eat them
Just when I thought my life was devoid of porpoise...
I knew dolphins were smart, but who knew they could be sarcastic?
It was funny the first month.
They think they're so clever, let them come up with a caption.
Do you think they can do a boat?
What's your guess -- empathy or mockery?
But is it art?
Entertaining, but not as good as the seal act.
Remind me again about the difference between sarcasm and satire.
Do you have any more of those mushrooms?
I heard they were capable of human like feelings- but schadenfreude?
The irony would be if they get rescued before us.
Bob, after 3,698 days, I hate to say it, but I'm no longer impressed with the dolphin show.
Ted, I 'm thinking maybe we should lay off the fermented coconuts for awhile.
It may just be a coincidence.
They aren't just smart, they're smartasses.
I know what happened to that bottle of antidepressants you lost.
Rough times. Abandoned at sea ... mocked by dolphins ... Trump got elected. I mean, what's next?
Every time you look, they stop.
Well, the good news is we've been seen...
Do you think they know how to do a cell phone tower?
Whoa... what was in that coconut?
Don't look now, Ron, but the locals are definitely mocking us.
Same show twice a day! It's making me crazy.
Smart, maybe. Annoying, definitely.
This is the highlight of our stay so far.
Oh look, dinner and a show.
I'd be happier if they imitated a rescue ship.
I dunno, it seems derivative.
Now they're just rubbing it in.
You guys think you could do a sailboat?
Now I'm certain that they are mocking us on porpoise.
I guess the larger the brain the more biting the sarcasm
I heard dolphins were smart but who knew they were such jerks.
The tree's off, but they captured your slouch perfectly.
Alright guys, tomorrow we'll work on spelling HELP.
I can't help wishing we'd trained them to do something more useful.
Hey Bob, check it out, these guys are getting good.
Are they being flippant?
You sure that was dramamine ?
Mocking the victims... that's human intelligence all right.
What do you think, is that sympathy or shadenfreude?
I'd say it's more mockery than flattery.
No, Robert, I'm pretty sure it's not a coincidence.
You always hear about dolphins being smart, but no one ever mentions how sarcastic the little creatures can be.
Don't look know, but I think we have a dolphinganger.
When do you suppose delirium sets in?
Okay, now they're just showing off.
You really gotta look this time!
Do you think they're doing it on porpoise?
Start doing jumping jacks - we will see how smart they are then.
It was cute when they imitated us on the sailboat...now it just seems mean.
How much of the brownie did you say to eat?
Better than what they imitated us doing last night...
Could we just get them to spell 'help'?
Remember when you told me to look for signs of intelligent life?
This would be much better if it was dinner and a show.
Initially I thought empathy, but now I'm only getting a sarcastic vibe.
I never thought I'd say it... but I miss the sharks.
I knew they were smart, but that's just mean.
Intelligent, sure. Helpful? Not so much.
I don't know. Fireworks? A flower?
Too bad we lost cell phones, that definitely would go viral.
There was a time I'd have paid good money to see that.
I never thought that I would see a dolphin as lovely as a tree.
So much for us being the only species capable of irony.
I saw them when they were in Vegas.
Finally, something worth tweeting.
Not bad. Can you do a boat?
This is the last group and I'm giving them a 10.
Very intelligent, but a little short on empathy.
The silver lining is that this would have cost us 150 bucks at Sea World
Well, sure, but they haven't won a Super Bowl since '74.
I think that's what they mean by multi porpoise
There's a thin line between performance art and parody, and these guys have crossed it.
There's a thin line between sympathy and sarcasm.
They're not only smart, they're smart-asses.
That's not bad..Can you do one of a boat?
They do know that we don't have snacks, right?
Go ahead. Mock my day.
Frankly, I find it derivative.
Look, a school of fish. Art school, probably.
They must be as bored as we are.
Am I hallucinating or are there two guys stuck on that Island?
Do you think they can spell 'HELP'?
Nice, but I think teaching them to get help would have been a better use of your time.
You should have never told them you worked on Broadway.
Look, the one doing you really nailed your despondent slouch
I can never tell if they're being playful or just mean.
Seriously, how about a boat formation?!
When you worked at Sea World, was irony part of their training?
Ok, now they are just rubbing it in
OK. I got one I know they won't be able to do.
They never get my nose right.
Let's stay til the show's over.
What ever happened to dinner first and then a show?
I would prefer it if rescue was the sincerest form of flattery.
It's our dolphingänger.
Okay, so maybe they are smarter.
I knew the sea would be harsh, but that's just mean.
If we just had my phone. That would totally go viral.
Before global warming, Sea World was right here
The line between idolatry and mockery is so very thin, isn't it?
I realize they're empathetic creatures, but this is overkill.
Apparently, they're a performance arts school.
I finally understand the concept of art imitating life.
More layoffs at SeaWorld.
Imitation is the highest form of f*#!*ing with us.
Yes, but is it art?
You should take a look at this, Sam. There's some very dark humor going on.
It's either a welcome to the neighborhood or schadenfreude.
All I'm saying is that I'm just not as fat as that dolphin who's playing me.
I told you not to feed them.
"OK... NOW their making fun of us.
You can take a dolphin out of Sea World, but you can't take Sea World out of a dolphin.
Well, I say there's a fine line between mimicry and mockery.
Bravo, but we're looking for a SEAL team.
That's great, but can they mimic a boat?
Hundreds of rescuers and we get cirque du soleil.
Yeah, but how long can they hold it?
Remember when you said this couldn't get any worse?
Only NEW YORKER readers would think this was funny.
Herbert, look! There are two dolphins stranded just like us!
Let me know when they form into a boat.
It's good. But derivative.
Observational research finds dolphins' intelligence advanced enough to mock the plight of man.
I don't stand like that.
If they can do that in the wild, I think even less of Sea World.
Looks like synchronized mockery.
There's never a camera around when you need one.
It's a nice gesture. But, I don't think they fully understand our situation.
It's bad enough without being mocked by the locals...
They're back...you up for another game of charades?
I wish they'd do the life raft again ...
Sometimes nature can be so cruel.
No, no Flipper. Bring a search and rescue team, not a synchronized swimming team.
Intelligent, yes - original, no.....
I'm starting to miss cable.
That's kind of cold blooded, guys.
No dolphin is an island
No, I don't see any ships on this side either.
Undeniably intelligent, yet sardonic.
Do you think we could get them to do a boat next?
They're flipping us off.
Is my nose really that big?
I knew we shouldn't eat the palm leaves.
Our charades team doesn't stand a chance.
Sushi sounds good. Why do you ask?
What would you say if I told you that abandoning a sinking ship isn't the most unusual thing that's happened to me today?
Well-Well. Synchronized belittling!
We could invite them over.
Did you order an edible dolphins arrangement?
Are you sure? 'Cause it feels like they're mocking us.
I never knew they were ironic.
Great! Sarcasm!
Nah, it's just the same one they did yesterday.
Everyday the same thing!
Nope, there's nothing to see on this side, either.
It's like saltwater in the wound.
I envy their family tree.
Good depiction but they don't capture your despair.
Let me know when they form a boat.
Well, no man is an island, but apparently a pod of dolphins manages it pretty well.
If you could teach them to spell out "HELP" then we'd really have something.
OK, now they’re really starting to piss me off.
I don't care if they're dolphins. I hate mimes.
That's nothing. We have opposing thumbs.
Do you think it has a porpoise?
Maybe they're looking for an agent.
Did you know that dolphins not only have a language, but they also understand satire?
Nope. Nothing on this side either.
Let's yell 'shark!'
Cheer up, the finale might be more impressive.
I don't think they're taking our plight seriously.
Let me know when they form a damn boat.
...Okay, now they're just rubbing it in...
Not bad! Now can you spell "HELP"?
I didn't know that schadenfreude was one of their emotions.
Paul, tell me the truth. Is my nose really that big?
Is sarcasm a sign of intelligence?
Does my nose really look that big?
Lassie would have gone for help.
No, I do not "gotta come see this."
Well, at least we've earned the sincerest form of flattery.
I expected this from the clownfish, but not you.
Well, the resort brochure DID promise live animal shows.
It's a shame we'll never get to share with the world our discovery that dolphins are total jerks
You know their doing that on porpoise.
It's eerily familiar, but I can't place it.
We should stop challenging them in charades.
I heard they were smarter than humans, they're also more sarcastic.
The one playing me--I'm gonna eat that guy first.
It's flattery all right, but I don't know how sincere they really are.
They are clearly strarved for subject matter.
Yes, they are trying to communicate with us. I think they're saying, "You're screwed."
They just don't seem to realize we're out of fish.
I think those two guys on the island are mocking us.
You have to admit their attention to detail is quite good
Sure, that's impressive. But Lassie would have at least gone for help.
Only talk to me if you see a boat.
Now they're just fishing for compliments.
Is it just me or is that island getting closer?
Hey Dude. It's Cirque du Fillet.
Suddenly I no longer care about dolphin safe tuna.
No, this time I'm sure they're trying to communicate with us.
I agree it's depressing. It's the same show every day.
Hey Fred, you're missing the grand finale
I know you said they're smart, but that's just mean.
Evidently our S.O.S call was recorded for training porpoises
They have great schools here.
Conspicuously derivative, but with a cruelly mocking flair.
On the other hand, maybe we're imitating them.
Okay, very slowly, give me your phone. I need to send a picture to my sister.
Yeah, it's not so charming the eighth time.
I know it looks fishy, but they're mammals.
And I thought I was bored.
Wow ! Now do SOS.
That's great guys, but can you make a boat?
That's OK, but can they make a boat?
If this is a mating ritual we're in serious trouble Fred.
I just don't understand performance art.
You're right. After the first few times it kind of loses its impact.
It took a few months. Now I'm teaching them to go for help.
I guess it's a performing arts school.
Why the hell couldn't they mimic a lifeboat?
I'm really glad they didn't see us last night!
Relax, it's a tropical illusion.
We're being schooled.
I also didn't believe Trump could win the election.
That's just mean.
Now they're just messing with us.
If they're so smart, why'd they end up on a desert island?
Jim, your gonna miss the finale!
You have to admit that their impressions aren't too bad.
I don't appreciate their sarcasm.
Elegant, intelligent and, clearly, assholes.
Okay, now they're just showing off.
I appreciate irony, but I think they're making fun of us.
Now they're just messing with us.
If their intelligence is so superior, why don't they mimic a boat?
Snark Attack
It would be cute, if we didn't have to listen to them laugh.
Now I understand the meaning of schadenfreude.
That's the same act I saw in Orlando.
Now they're just porpoisely mocking us
Not funny.
Damn it Joey. I told you realism was out and surrealism is in.
Does their art seem derivative to you?
Masterful execution, but the subject matter is derivative.
I don't know, it feels derivative.
I never knew they were capable of taunting.
Apparently, the smartest animals are also the most desperate for approval.
Do me a favor, please stop saying "everything happens for a reason."
I hope they're not expecting a treat!
Okay, you clowns. Now go get the Coast Guard
They may be intelligent but they're not funny.
Are we expected to give them a tip?
Is that empathy or sarcasm?
At what point does mimicry become mockery?
I've always known dolphins were smart. I just never realized they were so smart ass.
They perform well before a captive audience.
I knew they were smart, but I didn't know they were capable of sarcasm.
At least we won't be starved for entertainment.
It hurts more when you're mocked on porpoise.
Look! We've got dinner and a show.
Turns out dolphins are assholes
Clearly, you can take dolphins out of Sea World but you can't take Sea World out of the dolphins.
Their capacity for empathy is remarkable.
Man, voting 2-0 to legalize weed has been great.
the only edible leaf on this island had to be hallucinogenic
of course I like it, but it's not original.
Do you think after the show one of them could give us a ride home?
Highly intelligent and highly sarcastic.
And you think we're bored.
Kevin, do you still have that hammock?
There may, in fact, be a parallel universe.
I hate when they do that.
They're definitely doing it on porpoise.
Do you think we could get them to spell out "S.O.S."?
They're really rubbing it in.
I saw this on Broadway with the original cast.
'The realtor said there was a school nearby!'
Everyone's a comedian.
Does my nose really look like that?
Pretend you're a rescue boat.
You're not the only one who's bored.
Just great. Floor show but no dinner.
Your not gonna believe this, but remember those Dolphins we trained?
Um..... forget what I said earlier about how our situation was "bound to improve".
They're either highly empathic or they're totally mocking us.
Okay, now they're just being mean.
I prefer imitation crab.
Quick, pretend to be a boat.
What if we're the mirage?
Look, a message in a bottlenose!
I was having suicidal thoughts, but this is just so cute!
Say, did that coconut taste funny to you?
If they're so smart they'd be walking on land a long time ago.
Oh...nothing. What do you see?
I'll give it a 9.5
Turn around. I just realized we're "stranded" in the middle of Sea World.
If we only had a picture of a raft.
As I lean, dying against this palm tree, I take solace in the fact that I was at least born a human, the only animal with full consciousness granting the ability to observe life and communicate deep meaning through wry humor and irony.
I dunno, for all its obvious intelligence, it's disappointingly derivative.
It's certainly environmentally-friendly. But I'm not sure it's sustainable.
I don't get it.
Check it out, it's art imitating life!
I don't mind the taunting, but I could do without the smug smiles.
I don't think they're going for help.
I miss the sharks.
There’s hope: we’re trending.
I'd kill for a tuna sandwich.
Uh, Paul, come here a second.
Hey bonehead, God answered your call for 'a miracle'. You were too busy to elaborate?
Its either empathy or satire.
God, I miss cable.
At least we've been spotted.
If they do the show again this evening, then today is either Wednesday, Saturday or Sunday.
I gotta say, I thought your wish was about as stupid as they come, but this is pretty freakin' cool...
That's just mean.
I'm crushed to learn that dolphins are complete assholes.
C'mon Dale. One more sardine and I know I can get them to do YMCA.
You're missing the grand finale.
God I miss Cirque de Soleil.
Hmph! Clever but derivative.
Big deal. You did the exact same show last month.
Cruise director Rodrigo has also apparently survived the shipwreck.
They are performing No Man is an Island. Again.
I can't tell if we're in on the joke.
They're screwing with us again!
They look like they are having a lot more fun.
That one really captures your look of depression & hopelessness.
Spot 5 differences between the two images
I bet someone will come by and upload this to the internet before actually saving us.
Ask if they can do SOS ?
Not funny.
Somewhere out there, a cruise ship is missing an ice sculpture.
I know you said to just ignore them, Harv, but you really should see this.
Hey Carl, do you think they're sympathizing or empathizing....I always get those confused.
I'd give it a 9.5 for difficulty, but only a 4 for originality
It's a visually appealing reinterpretation, but lacking the compelling emotional gravitas of the original.
No more clapping for them, I've seen enough.
Day 3: They have accepted us as one of their own
Let's pretend to be a boat.
I guess dolphins are the only other mammal capable of mockery.
okay, in this instance, imitation is NOT the highest form of flattery!
Sure, that's nice, but can you get them to do a life raft next?
You can't tell me they're not mocking us this time.
The cruise ship sinks and yet the buffet centerpiece remains afloat.
I don't suppose you have a picture a of a boat on you?
Oh, that's just great. Like I've never seen that before.
I think I need to lay off the seaweed for a while.
These guys have way too much time on their fins.
Do you think they can make a boat?
SAVE, not COPY!
I can't believe those humans are mimicking us!
How do we tell them we're not playing charades?
If they're so smart, how come they're stuck on a desert island, too?
Forget everything I said about buying only dolphin free tuna.
Are dolphins known for their sarcasm?
Oh great, now the neighbors are mocking us.
"Do you think they noticed us"?
Now, that's just mean.
They think we're talent scouts from Sea World.
I miss Netflix.
Their mode of artistic expression is too literal for my taste.
Uh-oh, now they're humming the theme from "Jaws".
Nice, but not exactly original.
They got your nose perfectly.
You think they remember us from SeaWorld?
Quick, let's lie on the beach and look like a boat.
Yeah, like I said before, this is very impressive, but it's still not how you spell, "Help."
I'm going to give them the finger and see how they copy that
Are they mocking us on porpoise?
Very good, but can you do a boat?
You just HAD to use "Swim with the dolphins" as your final wish, didn't you?
I guess they meant it when they said "'No man is an island."
Perfect! Go show the Coast Guard and lead 'em here!
I think the dolphin playing me today is new.
Seriously? Couldn't think of something better to teach them in the past six months?
They were much more helpful in The Little Mermaid.
Definitely dolphins. Porpoises lack the capacity to mock in groups.
Now they're really just flipping us off.
That's adding insult to injury
Too representational for my tastes.
You're right, the quality of the entertainment is superior on this side of the island.
Nature IS cruel.
Once again, art imitates life.
Wow. Dolphins are assholes.
Dolphin-gänger?
Do you think they're doing it on porpoise?
OK, OK - I'm flattered. Now do a ship.
Believe me, if I was dreaming you wouldn't be in it!
Hal, I think we're being profiled.
Be patient Henry, this is the finale.
Okay, now let's train them to get help.
Derivative!
I said I wanted my life to have purpose.
They say they're as sarcastic as humans.
You can take the dolphins out of Sea World but you can’t take Sea World out of the dolphins…
My nose isn't THAT big.
In case it’s mockery I’m going to applaud ironically.
Now they are just taunting us.
I think we're being mocked.
Let me know when they form the shape of a rescue ship.
I think we've just crossed the line from entertainment to mockery.
Not bad, but it's a little derivative.
You do realize we can never have sex again.
No really. You really,really should see this. They have exactly captured you.
We should have trained them to be a boat.
Derivative, yes, but not without irony.
Hey Jake. You always told me to let you know when we've been here too long.
No, wait... they're definitely mocking us.
My hallucinations are mocking me.
Yeah, dolphins are smart but do they also have to be so sarcastic?
They may be smart but they're also irritating as hell.
Am I really that fat?
At least the sharks don't mock us.
Well, they captured the silhouette but they lack angst.
Don't blame me- charades was your suggestion.
I think they've seen us!
I get the sense we're being mocked.
Short on the comic and even shorter on the relief.
They're getting a lot better.
Could you do an impression of a rescue boat?
See, I told you animals CAN be cruel.
You're missing quite the show on this side of the island.
Intelligent, yes. But I didn't know they have a morbid sense of humor . . .
You have to admit, they learned a lot at Sea World.
I think Cirque du Porpeil has arrived.
I appreciate the energy and technique, but I still say it's derivative.
I mean seriously, you have to see this!
Ok, they're mocking us.
Our dolphingängers are back.
Playful? Yes. Creative? Definitely. Helpful? No.
Even if they are just trying to annoy us, it's impressive.
They must think we're talent scouts for Sea World.
They took gold in Rio
I never have a camera when I need one.
Are they being cruel or just highly communicative?
Why is this the best form of flattery?
I saw this show at the Bellagio.
It would really be impressive if they moved west and gave us some shade.
He has your nose.
Now that I see it, I don't think imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
Let me know when they build us a raft.
Boy, the one time I really wish I had my camera!
No more coconut wine for me.
Does art reflect reality or does reality reflect art? I just don't think it's the most urgent question, Karen.
There's something fishy about the new neighbors.
They're not going to leave until we applaud.
The accommodations aren't much to speak of here but the entertainment is first rate
Do I detect a note of sarcasm?
If only something would break up the monotony...
C'mon Joe. Be a sport. Hold up the 9 again
Do you ever just feel like you're in a New Yorker cartoon?
You win. The Dolphins beat the Marlins again!
No, seriously, you've gotta see this!
Do you think they are doing that on porpoise?
Bud look, I think our game of Charades has taken a sarcastic turn.
Is this what they mean by life imitating art?
OK, now do Trump's hair!
I think it's photoshopped.
I don't think they are going to stop until we pay them
That would be perfect for a New Yorker cartoon.
Well, I guess eating them is out of the question now.
Playful bastards, aren't they.
They don't have the angst right.
Do you sometimes see things that aren't there? Or are dolphins just assholes?
I think our time on the island has made me see things differently.
Dinner theater on this island really sucks.
I knew they were smart, but I didn't think them capable of mockery.
Technically, I think this makes us an archipelago.
Remember how you said that drinking sea water was "no big deal"?
I call it plagiarism.
I never said 'Simon says'
Don't bother getting up, we saw them at Sea World.
Try looking like a boat.
Could you maybe copy a lifeboat instead?
Well, I've stopped hallucinating simple foods.
NOT Charades again.
OK, the flashmob has officially jumped the shark.
Woaaaaah...I think we should've rationed those mushrooms.
Maybe they could form a raft next!
Dude, I never noticed, the big toe on my left foot is bigger than the one on my right.
And I thought we were bored
Do you ever get the feeling that there's a parallel tuna-verse out there?
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but we're still going to die.
Yeah sure, you're gonna tell me Donald Trump is president next...
See if they can mimic a yacht.
Now I'm sure the dolphins are mocking us.
I went through hell and high water to get tickets for this Cirque du Seaworld performance, the least you could do is turn around.
Until today, I had no idea I was pro trawler nets.
If we get out of here I'm eating tuna again.
I am going to keep making "the porpoise of life" jokes until you agree to switch sides with me.
You see a bunch of blowholes and I see Trump's cabinet; I'd call that a tie.
I hate team-building.
Not sure about you, but I'M going to stop licking those lizards.
And now we teach them to spell "HELP"
They definitely were holding back at Sea World.
I no longer believe that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
I can't stop thinking about sushi.
Maybe it's synchronicity, but I think they're doing it on porpoise.
I'm pretty sure they're porpoises. Dolphins have elongated beaks and are more creative at charades.
Don't look now, but I think we are being porpoisely mocked.
They're getting back at us for making squeaky-balloon noises at them all day yesterday.
You had to taunt them.
I've heard of mocking birds, but this is ridiculous.
I never realized dolphins were sarcastic.
Do me a favor. Stand on your head for a second.
Lighten up Phil and enjoy the entertainment
This may sound a little anthropomorphic, but I'm getting a real sarcastic vibe here.
At least they have a porpoise.
For the matinée they do the Eiffel Tower.
They're cute, but I still would rather have Netflix.
The food here is terrible but the entertainment is great.
"Sure, they're smart....but, ironic?
Herb, remember the time we were crawling through the desert and the prairie dogs started mocking us?
They're mocking us. Majestically.
I'm sorry. I have no spare change.
Do you think sarcasm's a sign of intelligence?
Remember when you said no one knows or cares where we are or what we are doing?
Simon says, "Stop playing around and go get help!"
This show would cost $500 at the Tropicana.
On the other hand... it is the sincerest form of flattery
Once we're rescued, I'll put in a good word for them at Sea World.
Great, now they're mocking us.
I drank way too much salt water.
They must think we're agents.
I bet if we're stranded long enough I can get them to do the Eiffel Tower.
On the bright side, you can't beat the podcasts.
The mocking has begun.
I wish they'd mimic a boat.
Do you have your camera?
Come look, honey – the neighbors have their holiday decorations up.
Oh my, it's the dinner show!
Now I just think they're mocking us.
The show's okay, I guess, but I would've killed for dinner.
It's one thing to be stranded, but quite another to be mocked.
Do you think they're mocking us?
Or we could take it as the sincerest form of flattery.
Interesting act, but we're really looking for something different.
My views on sushi have changed.
No, what's amazing is that you still don't know the difference between dolphins and porpoises.
I love art with a porpoise.
They're blocking my view.
Look! They're mocking us on porpoise.
I wonder if they can make a boat.
Honey, I know things don't look good, but can't we at least enjoy the show together?
Geez, would it kill them to clap? At Sea World, something like this would bring people out of their seats.
OK, now there just being jerks.
Haha, very funny...Can you save us now?
Oo, I could live forever on satire, couldn't you?
Now they’re just mocking us on porpoise.
Hey, Joe, your message in a bottlenose is back.
Part II: Question 93. Draw the next logical image.
Let's redecorate.
You're missing a helluva show!
Now they are just laughing at us.
And just like that, the dolphins captured the existential ennui of the castaways.
Maybe there is no porpoise.
Darwin, I think you should see this.
Henry, the dolphins are making fun of us again.
This sure beats that lame cabaret act on the cruise ship.
That does it, I'm done buying dolphin-safe tuna
We'll both do the splits; let's see them try and mock us then.
Wait till you see their dismount!
other than the flipper, he has you down perfectly.
Looks like Miami won this week.
So much for opposing thumbs.
These splash zone seats were worth it.
You can take the dolphins out of SeaWorld...
I hate charades.
Somehow they seem less stranded than we are.
''I still think it should take the form of a boat to qualify as irony.''
Yeah...but I'd still eat one.
You were right about those berries that washed ashore.
"Even more humiliating is that they call themselves 'The Trump Tower' ''
Four words. First word; three syllables. First syllable sounds like...
I think there might be a SeaWorld near here.
I think I can finally see the porpoise of life.
Even here he builds a Tower!
That’s either a mirage or the best seafood buffet I’ve ever seen.
Did you know, that in addition to the use of tools, sarcasm is a clear sign of intelligence in animals?
I bet they learned that in school.
The dolphins never got over being named the second smartest species on the planet
I don't have the heart to tell them we are out of fish.
I'm not questioning your skills as a 'Seaworld' trainer - I'm just not sure it conveys our message.
Even their mockery is downright cute.
Yes, but is it art?
Honestly, I'd prefer their imitation of a boat.
No one likes sarcasm.
If they're so damn smart, why aren't they at SeaWorld?
Shhhh, slowly--stand up and act like a boat.
Live from Galapagos, it's Saturday Night!
I know I have bigger worries right now, but am I really that short?
I've got a good one this time. I spy, with my little eye...
Nice, but rather derivative.
It's art. It doesn't have to have a porpoise.
Ya know, we're pretty lucky. In season they play the Bellagio Fountains in Vegas.
We really should've used that glue on the raft.
Although I wished I had my iPhone, this still wouldn't get as many views as a cat playing a piano.
Smart, yeah, but smart alecks, too.
Yup, we definitely shouldn't have eaten those coconuts.
Ooh! Ooh! I know this one!
See? I told you, stay positive and nice things will happen.
I guess they know we're vegans.
Sincerest form of flippery
Our message in a bottle must have ended up at Sea World.
They are much more creative than the sharks.
Do you really want to impress us? Spell out SOS.
I gotta say, the one on the left does have your nose.
Not just intelligent--ironic.
You can take the dolphin out of SeaWorld, but you can't take the SeaWorld out of the dolphin.
It's nice, but not quite ready for Cirque du soleil.
Let's don't eat any more tree bark.
Pretend you don't see them.
I know it's playful, but it still hurts.
They might win charades, but at least we beat them at rock-paper-scissors.
You sure that was just a regular cigarette?
They should know that there's a fine line between comedy and sarcasm.
OK, I'm starting to side with Japan.
No ship will ever notice us now.
See, even they're sick of desert island cartoons
You gave them a 3.2 last week. What did you expect?
Do you think they're being satirical or just mean?
That doesn't look like me at all.
Fred and George found out the hard way just how cruel dolphins can be.
I think we're being flippered off.
"Ok we get it. You're really smart".
Well, I'd give 'em an 8.5.
I guess I could have trained them to be a raft.
Schadenfreude: pleasure derived from the misfortune of others.
That's it. I'm no longer a vegan.
Not as great as yesterday when they spelled TRUMP without the T.
At least the neighbors are friendly.
If you can't laugh, at least applaud politely.
Not only they are smart, they also have a sense of humour!
You know those dolphins you told to make like a tree and leave?
I don't remember Flipper ever being this sarcastic.
Their chances of rescue are probablely better.
Trust me. This you're gonna want to see.
We must be the luckiest guys in the world--these seats are awesome!
I can't experience this properly without Twitter.
At least they're not sharks
Oh yeah? Well maybe THEY are imagining us.
And you thought life had lost all porpoise.
Now I see that life has more than one porpoise.
I love that entertainment is part of the all-inclusive package.
What takes more intelligence, mockery or conceptual art ?
I think they want to play charades.
If you're not going to look, Gary, imagine Jacque Cousteau meets Siegfried and Roy.
Now they're just making fun of us.
Perhaps it's their way of demonstrating empathy.
No Frank, I swear, you gotta see this mirage.
That one doesn't even look like you.
Just ignore them. They're doing that on porpoise.
Now they're just flipping us off!
They think they're so smart.
Nice, but that doesn't spell "HELP".
Empathy is overrated.
They sure know how to rub it in.
Copycats.
Man, that coconut we ate must have been bad.
I'm feeling a renewed sense of porpoise.
The hallucinations began on day 29.
Man, everyone's doing the mannequin challenge.
I hate it when art imitates life.
It's well beyond anthropomorphic.
Do you think they know life raft?
I think they are trying to imitate us on porpoise.
They make us look redundant, don't they?
I hate being objectified.
I guess it was funnier the first time.
sarcastic dolphins...who knew???
This morning I thought they were sympathizing with us but now I'm convinced they're mocking us.
There's something fishy about that palm tree.
Quick! Phil! They're doing it again!
On second thought, you might believe what I'm seeing....
Oh, it's no accident...they're mocking us on porpoise.
Don't stare, they'll want a fish.
It's Thursday again.
There's definitely something fishy about that island....
There's a fine line between playful and mocking.
They think they're so smart.
At least the neighbors are friendly.
I've heard them called 'playful'. I'd call it 'mocking'.
Beautiful as it is, I'm afraid this is going to have to be an Edible Arrangement.
I know they're mocking us; and yet, I'm strangely drawn to the coy one peeking out from beneath the fin.
If you'd just look, you'd see it's not just another one of my fish stories.
Okay, fine- you call it empathy. I call it sarcasm.
Very funny, boys, but sarcasm is not the same thing as intelligence.
I think it’s payback for visiting SeaWorld.
Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but I still can't shake the feeling they're making fun of us.
We must be close to Sea World.
Same pattern. I'm beginning to doubt they intend to go for help.
"Sometimes the line between comedy and cruelty is a thin one".
Lucky me. I get stranded with Cristo.
UNBELIEVABLE! The little one has your expression down pat.
Now they're just making fun of us.
They're touring.
This I can stand - what I really hate is when they go into boat formation.
Pretty good, but the sharks depicting our crash on the island was much more impressive.
Ever feel like the universe is just mocking you?
Are we being entertained or mocked?
Not sure, I think it's a cheer for a Miami football team.
Maybe, if we promise to lay off the sushi, we can get them to spell out 'S.O.S.
They're getting better at our voices.
I'm not flattered!
I guess they've also figured out postmodernism.
Apparently the animal kingdom has been faking it the whole time.
Yes, clearly this is art imitating life.
Climb the tree again, Harold, so they fall down.
I thought the matinee was more authentic.
I'll watch the 3pm show
No rescue party yet, Harry. Only a pod of schadenfreude dolphins.
It's the sincerest form of flattery
For intelligent mammals their satire is a little too on the nose.
And now they're just mocking us.
They can do that, but they can't get help.
Uh huh. And what was your third wish again?
I’ve always heard that dolphins are the smartest animals – but I didn’t know they were also the biggest smart alecks.
Apparently each one of us does in fact have a porpoise.
Look George it's Cirque Sea-Lay
Either excessive celebration or unsportsmanlike conduct - if I had a flag I'd throw it.
I'm sorry Bob, but I am a little flattered.
I had no idea that dolphins have a sense of humor.
I think they're still upset we ate their cousin.
I think you're right: that can't be a coincidence.
It's been three days, Chuck. Should we say something?
They must be bored too.
Huh. How derivative.
They're mocking us again Dom, screw "dolphin safe tuna."
I miss Ed Sullivan.
Nature really is cruel!
I could watch them forever.
Do me a favor, stand up.
Too much mercury.
Negotiations with Sea World failed. They're going out on their own.
Do you think they could mimic a boat?
Something tells me they are not here to help.
No, I don't think dolphins are more intelligent than humans. Why do you ask?
Does art imitate life, or life imitate art?
I never liked performance art.
Do we really look that fat?
There's something fishy about that tree.
Unlike its bottlenose cousin, the brown-nose dolphin is distinguished by its tendency to imitate as a form of flattery.
That's nothing. Last week they plaigerized my message in a bottle.
It's a windmill, right?
Out here, it's Cirque du Sole.
That's the problem with dinner theaters today. The show is impressive but where's the buffet?
You're right. It's mockery.
When are we going to tell them that we ran out of fish?
You're right. Shark du Soleil has lost its creative edge.
It's a benefit of our cruise travel insurance policy.
I don't care how good the joke is. We're the wrong audience.
got to cut down on those magic coconuts
Imitation may be the highest form of flattery but I stull think they're laughing at us.
There's no escaping Cirque du Soleil.
I, too, find post-modern live dolphin sculpture art to be rather jejune.
They're mocking us on porpoise.
Very nice, but I'd be more flattered by a ride to shore.
They're doing it again, aren't they?
We're not lost at sea, we're lost at Sea World.
I hate sharkasm!!
They say it's the highest form of flattery.
Great job! Can you make a boat now?
We need to be doing more yoga.
Weren't you the CEO of Seaworld?
I can’t believe what I’m seeing, Fred. They nailed it.
I always thought I was taller than that.
Either I’m hallucinating or we’re about to be rescued by Sea World.
Meh.
Sure they're cute, and I'm a vegan, but if I catch one, it's dinner!
Should we try shaping our bodies into a boat?
Are they mocking us on porpoise?
Bob, I swear they're copying us on porpoise.
At first, I enjoyed their company - now it seems they're just mocking us.
This must be the live entertainment that was promised in the vacation brochure.
And everyone thinks dolphins are so nice! Sarcastic bastards.
Well, they say it's the sincerest form of flattery.
now that's what i call synchronized swimming
That's not helpful.
I'd be more flattered if they cooked us dinner.
The North Atlantic's Got Talent.
They seem pretty smart, but I said S.O.S. and they give us U.S.O.
Wish they'd stop empathizing long enough to form a boat.
I feel like they're making fun of us.
I really wish I had my phone.
I prefer to think they're laughing WITH us, not AT us.
Must be some art school.
Let's see if they will do a life raft.
When SeaWorld's animal stars are set free...
I didn't know dolphins could be so sarcastic.
SEA WORLD escapees no doubt.
Float like a dolphin, shaped like a tree
I know they're mocking us, but you have to admire their creativity
Do you think I have a big nose?
I'm guessing this is payback for Sea World.
I don't know about you, but I think they're making fun of us.
Ok, for your next trick you need to become a boat and take us to the mainland.
Then again, maybe they should throw us a herring.
I didn't say 'Simon says.'
They do this on porpoise.
...no. no particular reason. I just think it would be fun to sit in the shape of a rescue boat.
Bill, where is that genie? I wished for some "purpose" in my life. "PURPOSE!"
I don't want to swim with them anymore - they are just mocking us.
I think I hate being mocked even more than I hate sea-level rise.
It's more like taunting than 'playful'
...and the Dolphins are penalized for an Illegal Formation.
The brochure did say. 'Watch the dolphins play."
They remind me of us.
Why is everything so curated nowadays? What happened to just hanging out?
You ask what are they doing now? Messing with us.
I don't care how intelligent they are, it feels a bit mean.
Next time, let's form a catamaran.
We're not interested, try Sea World
Dolphins or porpoises? I wish we could Google it.
Who said imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
It wouldn't have been so bad if they weren't all smiling.
If they can do that, surely we can swim.
Couldn't you have trained them to get help?
So let me guess ... you think the mermaids were better.
I always buy dolphin friendly tuna, and this is the thanks I get?
Oh come on. I don't look like that!
Does that island look a little fishy to you?
Stuck in shark infested waters, the Winstons suffer through the warm-up act.
It's not flattery; they are taunting us.
I think they're mocking us again.
Hey Stu, let's moon them.
Very funny, but that doesn't look like me at all.
They say they feel our pain.
Vertebrates, warmblooded, feed milk to young, sense of sarcasm ...
I hate mimes.
Look! I think they're doing that on-porpoise
Quick Harold! Look! They're doing it again...
We are not amused.
It's just irritating if you ask me.
You say it's empathy, I say it's mockery.
If we ever get off this island, that is the exact tattoo I'm getting
"They mock what they don't understand".
Are my thighs really that wide?
Suddenly I feel very insignificant.
Too soon, guys.
Yeah, but can you juggle
Do you ever get the feeling we're being mocked?
Impressive, but I'd still rather see a boat.
I stopped eating tuna for this?
Is THAT what I really look like?
The neighbors are showing off again!
Wait! They do this in the wild too?
SeaWorld really needed to do a better retirement preparation program.
I hear they're the only other species to openly mock you in life-threatening situations.
That palm tree looks a little fishie to me.
Now do 'potable water.'
Bob, I'm sure it's just a coincidence.
I think we should re-think that Vegan oath we took!
It's so annoying. They see the fun side of everything!
I'm sensing a lot more mockery than flattery.
I've seen better.
If no man is an island, is it because he lacks a porpoise?
Find out if they have an Uber dolphin among them.
Just what we need: SeaWorld, with irony.
Intelligent, maybe. But I think they're just jerks.
I'm not sure, but I think we may have just won something
Gawd, nothing ever happens here!
They're mocking us, but for what porpoise?
Wow! I wonder what inspired that?
It is entertaining, but we should've trained them to fetch us some food.
Quick, look like a motor boat.
Do you think they might be Uber dolphins?
Too bad there aren't more people to watch this!
I think we provide them a sense of porpoise.
Can they do a yacht?
I think all that sushi has started to effect my hallucinations.
Is it a good or bad omen when you see your dolphingänger?
There's nothing so truly annoying as synchronized swimming.
I can't look. It was bad enough when they all did the " Flipper laugh.."
Is it mimicry, mockery, or performance art?
It's not that good of an impression; the one standing up doesn't look like me at all.
No fish is an island.
I'm not getting up to look unless they do the Statue of Liberty.
Only God can make a tree.
No food. No fresh-water. And now you're telling me you didn't pack the cameral!
At least our message in a bottle reached SeaWorld.
Wait'll they find out we ate all the fish.
I swear they do that on porpoise.
I can't believe you called them gay sharks.
What is the porpoise of this mockery?
I think they're teasing us on porpoise.
I just realized that I forgot to renew our Sea World membership!
If it weren't for all their clicking, they'd be pretty good Mimes.
We never laugh anymore.
They're mocking us now, Harold.
I think art for art’s sake is the term you’re looking for.
Sadly, many of them haven't been able to adjust to life on the outside.
I know it's supposed to be a palm tree, but all I see is food.
Well, it beats staring at the horizon.
I think they're mocking us.... Yes, on porpoise!!!
Funny...Dazzling displays of nature usually distract me from our plight.
Sure it's clever, but what's the porpoise?
I miss the man-eating sharks. At least they didn't mock us.
Don't look impressed, act normal.
They're dolphinately doing it on porpoise.
But can they turn into a life raft?
It’s either a playful homage or a mocking taunt.
Charades was a lot less cruel before we met the dolphins.
Well, it is the sincerest form of flattery
Dolphins are jerks
I never imagined that dolphins could be capable of such a twisted sense of humour.
Atoll trolls
I don't have the heart to tell them we're not from SeaWorld.
Don't lose hope. Apparently we're now a meme.
Nice; where we see crisis, they see art.
Keep still. Mimes usually do not attack unless they feel threatened.
Did you know that dolphins are the only other animal that mock people for pleasure?
Well, if they're sincere then I suppose we should be flattered.
I see it the other way: life imitates art.
Larry, do you believe in an animal parallel universe?
Oh how I've missed sarcasm.
Do we really look like that?
Do you think we blend in?
After this, do you think you could teach us to swim?
Frank, look quick! They're doing it again!
What's the opposite of a mirage?
Do you think they would form into a boat if we asked nicely?
Now that's synchronized swimming!
Built with porpoise.
I know I should be angry, but they're making it difficult.
Oh, forget it...If you didn't believe me about the whale rectangle and the shark trapezoid, you're definitely not going to believe this one.
I'm still not convinced it's intelligence and not just instinct.
Now they’re mocking us on porpoise.
No... I think it's Nature imitates Art.
make like a boat,lets see what they can do with that
I'd give anything for a harpoon right now.
I have the feeling we are being mocked.
They're teasing us on porpoise.
You never believe me; so...nothing happening here!
Looks like Sea World released more dolphins ...
Cheer up the dolphin show is amazing.
What’s a hallucination look like?
Honey, you're wrong. There IS a porpoise in life.
I've heard of intelligent design - but that's ridiculous!
The mimicking I can take. It’s the taunting I can’t stand.
Exactly what kind of brownies did your sister make for us...?
George, look! It's Cirque Du Soleil Pacifica!
'Sea World should have never set them free.'
I am praying they will transform again into a seaplane.
No dolphin is an island
You can take the dolphins out of SeaWorld...
Can't they turn into a raft instead?
I've heard they're great mimics, but now I think they're just being cruel.
Congrats Gary, you're no longer the biggest asshole in a 100 mile radius.
Think of it as art imitating life?
They may be good at charades, but they are still really bad at rock, paper, scissors
How do you know that the dolphins aren't hallucinating you?
They're imitating us, but if you look you'll ruin it.
I think we're being trolled.
"I knew I shouldn't have eaten that little mushroom I found growing on the tree".
On the bright side, we've discovered that dolphins can mock.
Quick - make like a boat!
Hey Chuck, you wouldn't happen to know much about the mating process of Bottlenose Dolphins?
They're not only smart...they have sense of irony.
We may have no food, but at least we have performance art.
They're out-performing us again, George.
It's like we're stuck in a New Yorker cartoon.
It's either a serious hallucination or fake news.
Sure, they're talented. But they are also extremely insensitive.
Look guys, I'm flattered but it'd be more helpful if we could just ride on your backs
Art imitates life!
Very talented, but no creativity.
They say humor is the key to survival. That and a speargun.
Nah... nothing interesting on this side either. Keep looking in that direction.
I think those humans are mocking us
I've heard of mocking birds, but this is ridiculous.
What happens in the South Seas, stays in the South Seas.
Fuck you.
They're porpoises. Dolphins don't mock.
I'd like to think it's more empathy than mockery.
They're mocking us again, Marvin.
I would give anything for a new Mirage
If they’re imitating us, I’m not flattered.
Is my nose really that big?
Public art---such a waste of tax dollars.
Next category is "familiar place."
The last show in the world I want to see now is SEA WORLD
Bob, we should try and make the shape of a raft.
Impressive, but would you mind doing that again for the Coast Guard?
Everybody is into performance art these days.
Great Mannequin Challenge entry, guys, but we still need help.
And to think they did this just to get in the New Yorker caption contest.
Wouldn't it be better to teach them how to imitate a ship?
I always knew they are smarter than us.
Now I think they are just mocking us....
I think those dolphins are mocking us on porpoise.
We mock that which we do not understand.
Now their just mocking us.
Nice job Flipper, now show us your S.O.S.
Who said climate change isn't real?
So much for the theory that once released from captivity into the wild, they resort back to their natural ways.
Never mind. It's imitation seafood.
So, performance art IS an evolutionary form.
Big deal! I saw the same thing in an Esther Williams movie.
Let's see if they can do a helicopter.
At least there's some intelligent life out here.
And here I am without my camera. Can you believe it?
I think they are mocking your long nose
Do you think they're mocking us or just trying to make us feel a little less screwed?
I think we're near Florida
Remember when you said that our lives have no porpoise...?
They're mocking us, Dave.
Should we build a wall?
Yeah, dolphins are playful. Big deal.
Wrong miracle.
Yea but can they grow coconuts?
The cartoonist is making fun of our misery.
You call it empathy; I call it Schadenfreude.
They say imitation is the best form of flattery.
Dolphins are assholes
I think they are doing that on porpoise
Maybe we should pretend we're a boat.
Just wait until they do their dolphin impression.
Seaworld must be holding auditions again.
Yeah, well, I don't think imitation is always the sincerest form of flattery.
I don't have the heart to tell them about the election.
Are they doing it on porpoise?
Did you ever get the feeling you were being mocked?
At least they have a porpoise.
Wait 'til Sea World hears about this.
You're missing the show.
I'm done... No more games of Charade with the dolphins.
Ask them if they know how to do pastrami on rye.
Ever feel like nature is mocking us?
They had to block the view, didn't they.
Did they say Life imitates Art or vice-versa?
How do we tell them we're not here auditioning for Sea World?
Don't know about you, but I am SO bored with the same old routine.
Hon, remember what you said about monotony driving you crazy?
Look, Fred, a cirque du soleil dolphin mirage
Get the camera
Do you think they did that on porpoise?
That's just great. Sadistic dolphins.
They're mocking us again!
It's hard to decide whether art imitates life or life imitates art.
There's a fine line between 'playful' and 'immature.'
What's the porpoise of life anyway?
See... it's not impossible to have fun under these circumstances.
I think they're teasing us on porpoise.
TripAdvisor said whales, not dolphins. They'll be lucky to get 3 stars from me!
I suppose life does imitate art.
Please tell me Uber has a fleet of dolphins now.
Al are you sure that coconut milk was not fermented?
I think my mirage was better.
Highly intelligent but wildly impractical.
Are they mocking us? I feel like they're mocking us.
I'm in the mood for an Esther Williams movie.
Jim, don't turn around. This will NOT help your mood.
What's the difference between flora and fauna again?
My hallucinations are getting unoriginal.
Looks like SeaWorld released its performance art division back into the wild.
I think they're trying to tell us that we're stuck on a desert island.
Now could you get them to spell "help?"
I knew they could be cheerful; who knew they could be sarcastic?
I hate smug dolphins.
They nailed it again.
I'm feeling imitated but not flattered.
I'm sure they are doing that on porpoise
I am never going to Sea World again.
Which one of us is the hallucination?
I didn't know they were capable of sarcasm.
Training them to bring us fish to eat? -- NO! You want to be entertained!
The good news is that you've been granted eight fishes.
Ahoy, there! Can you guys make a boat?
Dolphins are too smart for their own good.
Okay, enough with the charades!
I'm pretty sure they're doing it on porpoise.
Dolphins are such bastards.
So does this mean the universe has intelligent design, or that it just likes messing with us?
My life has no porpoise.
You look and look for a porpoise in life, and then tree come along at once.
Great. Now can you synchronize a distress call?
I still see no porpoise.
Really, I see it more as an abstract work.
I don't think those were coconuts.
Our friends did this on porpoise
Sea World can't be far.
I'd give the technical difficulty a '5' at best.
The good news? We seem to be the envy of the neighborhood.
Now they're just being jerks.
Don't worry, I've sent a message in a bottlenose.
Don't tell them we're out of fish.
Tom, did you drink the water, too?
I can't believe we lost the mannequin challenge to a pod of posers...
At least the hallucinations are entertaining.
There's no way I'm as old as the one they've got playing me.
Well, at least somebody is enjoying themselves.
I liked them more before they found out about performance art.
Stranded on an island at Sea World, someone should find us soon.
If they're so smart, why don't they rescue us?
"Those dolphins are really starting to make me lose my passion for post modern abstract symbolist representation.''
They're doing that thing they do before they attack.
Well, at least nobody left us stranded on porpoise.
We had to get stuck with one-trick dolphins.
They're not mocking us. It's just one of those Facebook Flash mobs.
If they're that smart, why don't they order us some take-out.
Harold ... the mimes ... they've found us!
Thanks, but we're not flattered!
I wonder what happens if the bottom one sneezes.
Yeah, yeah, fantastic. But theirs can't grow coconuts!
There's something you don't see every day.
I don't mind being deserted, but I hate being mocked for it
I think something mysterious was in that coconut.
Remember when I accused you yesterday of hallucinating?
A fountain? Uh, windmill? I know - a pinwheel! No? This one's a toughie...
I think they are mocking us somehow.
They're mocking us and they're doing it on porpoise.
I knew dolphins were friendly, but who knew they were such good mimes?
Art mocking Life.
They're making fun of us, aren't they?
The Aqua-Uber's here.
"Yeah, rub it in show offs.
I hear they taste like chicken.
Let's play rock, paper, scissors and see what they do...
Dude, I think I'm starting to hallucinate.
They're doing that on porpoise!
Imitation is highest form of flattery!
They're right, we need to lighten up and enjoy the moment.
Dolphins are well known for irony.
Ever get the feeling we're being mocked?
Of course they're magnificent. But I'm still going to write a scathing review.
I think they are trying to tell us something.
Is it sympathy or mockery?
All those years as a marine biologist, and now they show me complex taunting behavior.
Is that the dolphin signal for 'You're screwed'?
What does one have to do to get away from this kind of crap?
Show offs.
Something about that other island looks fishy.
Yeah, the food sucks, but the entertainment is marvelous!
Do we have a higher porpoise?
Nice to see they've found work after all the water park lawsuits
I think the sun is frying my brains. That tree is starting to look like a pod of dolphins.
Do you think they see us?
Well, that wasn't in the brochure.
Oh, I have been DYING to see this show!
Not exactly my idea of dinner and a show either.
They are porpoisely mocking us!
I take it back, I would eat those damn condescending mammals.
They're mocking us on porpoise.
Listen, you there.....SOS does not mean Same Old Shtick!
I wish I could see what you see, but my life has no porpoise.
I guess I never realized flattery could be so goddamn ironic.
Surrounded by ocean...yet nothing but imitation fish.
You think they can do a motorboat?
No, still no ships ...
Hey, look, it's the Island of the Blue Dolphins!
How good are you at reading omens?
Tell them to try the Bellagio.
Well I think giving them all the fish was worth it.
I do believe they're mocking us on porpoise.
I don't remember Flipper being so flippant.
...And just when I thought my life had no porpoise...
It seems man isn't the only mammal capable of mockery.
I might be impressed if I wasn't so hungry.
Don't be silly, you are only imagining the whole world is mocking us"
Their performances are starting to take atoll.
Now let's see if they can keep it up as long as us...
Do you get the feeling we're being mocked?
Are they mocking us, or the tree?
Appropriation or homage?
They're either here to save us or they're having a laugh.
Looks fishy to me
I don't think we're doing enough with our lives.
I'm telling you, that tree just winked at me.
I thought they were supposed to be smarter than us.
Mockingbirds are one thing - but mocking dolphins? That's just cruel.
Well, they say "imitation is the sincerest form of flattery".
Jerks...
Don't move Eunice; let's see how long they can stay like that.
I see no porpoise in that.
I knew your flipper imitation would come back to haunt you.
Boy, I miss YouTube.
Reminds me of the ice sculpture at my wedding!
I wish they'd quit using us to hide from the orcas.
Great news, our fresh and creative sea food platter has finally arrived.
Don't look now, but that dolphin mime troupe is at it again.
Tell me if I'm out of line but I think they're doing that on porpoise
It's the twinkly little half-smiles that make it hurt.
The one on the left is starting to look pretty cute.
Joe, they are making fun of us again.
i think they're giving us the 'fin'ger!
They are so mocking us!
This is our lucky day they need an agent.
I still say they're porpoisely mocking us.
It's all just so depressingly derivative.
They're dolphinantly mocking us.
Must they copy everything we do?
Do you think they're mocking us on porpoise?
I spy with my little eye...
Flattery, shmattery. If they come any closer, I say we eat them.
I heard that dolphins can be kind of mean, but wow.
Great mimic intelligence, but no empathy!
I can't decide if they're taunting us.... or entertaining us.
Yeah, they're super-talented and smart, but I already know what a desert island looks like.
We could have sushi for dinner
Look how they've reporpoised themselves.
Their waiting for their score.
No, I think they travel in pods, not octets. Why?
A porpoise full demonstration.
There's a special place in hell for whoever said imitation is the greatest form of flattery.
The SeaWorld refugees are back...
You're right, no more intimacy until they leave.
They're mocking our perceived hierachical order of intelligence.
No imagination!
Imitation is a form of flattery my ass.
They're dolphins, clearly - the porpoise does not have such a well-developed sense of schadenfreude.
When life imitates art there is no porpoise.- The Dali Dolphin
You're missing the whole fin-ale.
Sure they're smart, but they obviously can't hear. I said, "Can you make yourselves into a raft," not "Do you want to be photographed."
I knew they possessed excellent emotional mirroring skills but this is some next level stuff.
Mating season will be a challenge.
Well that certainly is impressive. Do you also do a "Rescue at Sea" routine or is this your only act?
Being stranded is bad enough, but I didn't count on the mocking.
There is a message in the bottle-nose for us.
Oh for Pete's sake! Can't you talk about anything but FISH.
I see several porpoises, but no purpose.
They're definitely doing it on porpoise.
We should have brought the kids!
Maybe I'm losing it, but I think we're approaching Finland.
Bob. Can you pantomime a raft?
Lassie was better signaling for help.
I'm not sure but I think they are doing that on porpoise.
"Playful" my eye. That's just mean.
I told you to not throw them a fish
I see a new porpoise in life.
It's like they understand us only enough to taunt us.
Honey, either you were right about not drinking the sea water, or those dolphins are taunting us.
Let's just remember that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
I've reconsidered who should get the title of "Second Smartest Mammal"
If we only had a cell signal -- this is Instagram gold!
It makes me look fat
Those must be the extremely rare "MockingFish"
All that training we gave them. Just so they could mock us.
Uggh, we're being saved by Cirque de Dauphin
I think they're Flipper-ing us off.
Please impersonate a boat!
Let's take it one more time from the top.
Rehearsing for their upcoming debut, the Blue Dolphin Group entertains a captive audience.
The dolphins are mocking us again.
Endangered species be damned!
Personally, I think synchronized swimming is overrated.
I get the meaning, but I'm not sure about the tone.
I guess art does imitate art, Mike.
Looks like dolphins are good at irony too.
I wish Sea World had taught them to fetch a rescue ship.
I think they're using irony.
Well, it is the sincerest form of flattery
It's like they were mocking us....
If I were Hemingway, I could write about this.
They need to find a new porpoise.
Harold, is that a tableau or a tableau vivant?
Now can they get serious and spell out SOS?
Remind me to update Wikipedia if we get rescued.
They're intelligent enough to mock us.
We just can't compete with these pop-up islands...
I think we're somewhere near Mandalay.
Yeah, they got the bronze in Rio - synchronized swimming.
How is this better than a message in a bottle?
"It's payback for all those fishing trips we took".
That's lovely and all, but can you form a rescue ship?
There is something fishy about that other island
I think I'm Flippering out bro.
Now they're just showing off.
I know they're smart, but they don't know how to get out of here either.
Really, guys? Really? You won't let us ride you back to civilization?
This whole synchronized swimming thing has gotten out of hand.
Its at times like this that I wonder what is the porpoise of life.
They think they're such hot stuff; just remember, we have opposable thumbs.
I don't think they have middle fingers, do you?
Message in a Bottlenose.
They say they use to rescue people, but then decided based on our television preferences that we preferred to be entertained to death.
They're not mocking us, Jerry, that's just the sound they make.
now they are just mocking us
So they can be a palm tree, but not a rescue boat? That's just passive aggressive.
At least our predicament is not without porpoise.
Either they're very talented or we should lay off the raw bream for awhile.....
Dolphins can be really insensitive
Do you think they're trying to make us feel bad on porpoise?
I'd prefer an iPod.
What's the tipping etiquette in this situation?
Nope. I'm not falling for that again.
They ARE playful and intelligent. And I think they're messing with us.
Well on the bright side at least we get the Dolphin game this weekend.
Do you think they have a porpoise behind this?
When I wished for an island worth of fish, I should have been more specific
Who says life is without porpoise?
If they're so smart, how come they don't have anything better to do than making fun of us?
I would rather be circled by sharks than have to watch synchronized dolphins
I suddenly have a sense of porpoise in my life.
They're just taunting us now.
Oh, my God, the one on top looks like Esther Williams!
Life imitating art.
Somebody's been watching too many Esther Williams movies.
now that's what i call synchronized swimming
The experts say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but I'm pretty sure they're just mocking us.
You only hear from the people they save.
Now I just think they're mocking us.
Not only they are as smart as we are, they also have a finer and cruel sense of humour.
Oh look, they're trying to cheer us up.
Impressive, yes, but replicating a raft would be more so.
Sometimes, its art that imitates life.
I now find it just annoying.
Two words...first word...sounds like....
There are some days I just wish we weren't vegans.
Okay, I give up. What DO you spy beginning with 'D'?
These ones don't appear to be the rescuing kind.
Tell me again, how pigs are smarter than dolphins?
I wish we had a spear and some sticky rice.
They must have figured out 'ironic realism' before they were released from Sea World.
I'd like to think it's flattery.
I've decided I'm not going to clap anymore. They like it so much that I think they don't want to get us rescued.
Their just messing with us now!
See anything on your side?" "No. See anything on your side?" "No.
You need to see this new twist to the desert island joke.
It's the rescue team from the Cirque du Soleil cruise ship.
Clever. But I bet they didn't predict the presidential election.
Talk about mockery at its finest...couldn't they just snort "na na nana na"?!
Ignore them. They're just trying to be clever.
Okay, now they're just taunting us.
Are they mocking us, or are we mocking them?
They show so much empathy.
Biomimicry? This is biomockery!
I like theirs better.
At least it's entertainment.
It wasn't the best performance ever, but it was still better than Cats.
We'll tell everybody that we were stranded on an island with the Dolphin Cheerleaders.
The entertainment value is starting to wear off.
A raft is a much simpler configuration.
I think they misunderstood when I asked for a ride
They're echolocation clicking at us, not with us.
Caricature? Or homage?
How far are we from sea world?
Don't they know representational art is out?
Just when your convinced that there's no order in the universe.
Mimes, they're everywhere.
Sure they're smart animals, but I still wish we had cable.
Look, Fred. Our dolphinium is in bloom!
Mocking birds I get.
Well you know what they say, Bob. Art imitates life.
Let's just hope it's not a mating dance.
They are doing this on porpoise.
There's nothing worse than a school of mockfish.
It just proves there's a porpoise for everything.
I hate it when they make fun of us.
Same show - every day! Booorrrring!
If we are this close to SeaWorld, let's save ourselves by swimming.
They say imitation is the fin-est form of flattery.
They have empathy!
Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but I think they're just rubbing it in.
What if our palm tree had coconuts on it?
This is way better than a message in a bottle.
God !! I hate sarcasm !!
Perfect! Now go find help.
I told you they have a porpoise.
Somehow it doesn't feel like flattery to me.
It's not flattery. They're making fun of us.
I knew they were nimble. I didn't know they were smart-alecks.
Here come the rejects from Sea World again.
It's a snarky sense of humor, that's true, but not an unsophisticated one.
Well, at least they're having fun.
No fish is an island.
Well, yes…I suppose schadenfreude is a sign of animal intelligence.
Pictionary?
I think they're mocking us on porpoise!
Ok, now they're just making fun.
Do they have to be smarter than us in EVERYTHING?
Do you think they're good enough to make a plane?
Am I hallucinating or are the dolphins mocking us?
You know what they say: a cetacean is the sincerest form of flattery.
Scan the horizon when they form a yacht.
The did that on porpoise.
I've never hallucinated on porpoise before.
I hate to interrupt your thoughts but what is the difference between dolphins and porpoises?
Check it out, Bob. Those humans on that island over there are posing just like us!
I got it, they're intelligent, but do they have to mock us, too?
I hate being mocked on porpoise.
I'm starting to think imitation is not the sincerest form of flattery.
How close are we to Vegas?
Well now they're just mocking us.
It's an advertisement for Christmas seals.
There's something fishy about that island...
I'm suddenly feeling guilty about all the tuna I've eaten.
Part of me wishes I hadn't used all our fish for training porpoises.
Do you think they're making fun of us?
I'm pretty sure it's a mockumentary.
Impressive - but we can't afford to take on any more staff.
I'll bet you for the last candy bar that we'll see a dolphin today.
I think the folks from Sea World have found us.
There goes the lagoon!
They're mocking us again!
Now I’m sorry I ever bought dolphin safe tuna.
Well... immitation is the greatest form of flattery.
They're only taunting us because we're vegans.
Best impersonation I've seen since Alec Baldwin.
You know, I'm starting to think they're mocking us.
I think they're showing either empathy or sarcasm.
Look, copycatfish!
They're as bored as we are.
Ah, Doug! Look how hard they try to keep us amused!
If they're so smart, why don't they know another game besides Charades?
Do we really look like that?
Something fishy is going on.
Being a fish out of water just doesn't have the same meaning that it used to.
I miss the imitation crab.
I think it's the cast from that new Vegas act, Cirque du Filet.
This week on Survivor, the Miami Dolphins vs. the Minnesota Twins.
Purpose. I said I'd like to know the purpose of this island.
Mocking or not, they're really good!
Do you get the feeling they're mocking us?
Should I tell them Sea World isn't hiring?
I think they are mocking us
I don't really feel like water yoga today.
Fish or mammal, dolphins can be real dicks sometimes
Perhaps we should have eaten those fish, rather than using them all as training rewards
You should see their Eiffel Tower
I miss whimsy.
I've finally stopped hallucinating simple carbohydrates.
I don't mind being entertained, it's the mocking tone that's really bumming me out.
Hey, Bob, you'll never guess what I see this time.
Hey, Stan. Who knew porpoises know sarcasm?
Hey Bill, I think I finally figured out what a "meme" is.
I forgot how much I miss Sea World.
We need to make it look like we're on a boat.
Shall we swim over for Happy Hour?
George, I may be going crazy, but I think they're doing that on porpoise.
I think it's empathy
I appreciate the entertainment, but can't they just puke up a couple of mackerels?
Should I tell them Trump won?
Hey, we must be close to Sea World.
I think I miss Miami football the most.
Playful, we know. A sense of irony has never been observed, before now.
Movie title, three syllables, first syllable rhymes with 'fast'; c'mon, Harry, I could use some help here.
Let's see how well they do with our tap dance routine.
They say imitation is the sincerest form of mockery.
No dolphin is an island, but eight are.
I can't decide if they're rescuing us or making fun of us.
You should have finished that course in sign language.
But can it really be called an "installation" if it's not in a gallery?
I thought dolphins were supposed to be all sensitive and new-agey.
I think they're trying to tell us they understand our plight.
They're saying Shark du Soleil is coming
I wonder what we are sitting on?
They make it look so easy.
Is it just me, or do you think there is something fishy about that other island?
I miss the days when we did the baiting.
How do we get them to mimic a rescue boat?
Fine, Brett, I admit it: Dolphins are total assholes.
There's no way this is a coincidence. They have to be doing it on porpoise.
Either I'm hallucinating or their brains are larger than ours.
Are they mocking us porpoisely?
The absurdity of our situation compels me to question the porpoise of life.
Great impression but we would prefer a ride home.
I think they're flirting with us.
They're just messing with our heads...on porpoise
I'm confused ... is this really evidence of dolphin intelligence?
After first mocking the castaways in a stunningly creative tableau, the dolphins then escorted them to a deserted island without a tree, just for giggles.
Damn mimes!
Are they doing it on porpoise?
How come ours doesn't have those tiny coconuts?
This could be the beginning of a meaningful communication or just a spectacular display of flippancy.
Quick, let's try to look like a boat!
A graceful taunt is worth a thousand insults.
Now they're doing it on porpoise.
Our lives finally have porpoise.
They're just Republicans. The exuberance will pass.
COPYFISH
Hey, I think they're doing it on porpoise.
George, you're missing the dolphins' cheerleading competition.
Cheeky, aren’t they?
I don't see the porpoise.
That's the last time I play "Simon Says" with a bunch of dolphins.
Now who is the more intelligent species...
Porpoise envy.
Empathy is overrated.
I feel like they are doing it on porpoise.
Hey, look! I finally taught them how to make a 'selfie.'
You can take the dolphin out of the aquarium but...
They're making fun of us.
How on earth did they hear about the Mannequin Challenge?
I'll say this, what these dudes lack in imagination, they make up for in showmanship.
Sorry, gang. We’re just not in the mood for whimsy.
Well, at least, imitation is the sincerest form of flippery.
Quick, build a wall!
We should bring this show to a bigger audience.
I don't think they get us.
You don't by any chance have a photograph of a boat, do you?
It's beautiful, but does it serve a porpoise?
honey.....today's mirage looks like dolphin with the stars
Quick - make like a boat!
Remember when you were saying you were sorry you hadn't had a porpoise-filled life?
Granted, porpoises are smart; also a morbid sense of humor.
I had given up hope until I experienced art with a porpoise...
Blue Fin Tuna Man Group?
They may not be helpful, but they sure are entertaining.
Do you think they learned that at school?
The good news is we are three thousand miles away. The bad news is we can still get Twitter.
At least they're empathetic.
How can they be so degrading and still be so cute?
If we spoke Dolphin we could hitch a ride out of here.
Finally a chance to find porpoise in our lives
Okay, now you're just showing off
"Very impressive, but you wouldn't have a chance on 'Shark Tank'".
Day 47: We have infiltrated the enemy base. They still have not noticed.
It was the best of times. It was the worst of times
It took me eight years to train there guys and you're not even going to take a look?
I wish I had my camera!
Remember that bad sushi we ate on the cruise ship?
That's quite the effort. Should we ask them over for drinks?
Those assholes are really getting a little too good at charades.
Do you think they know how to write "S.O.S"?
Sincere or not, I'm just not in the mood for flattery.
Quick, pretend to be a boat.
If they're so intelligent, why can't they do a motor boat?
Hey, I think they're mocking us...
I told you I hate the Ice Capades, I hate synchronized swimming and I hate "stranded on an island" cartoons.
Don't get so excited... It's imitation seafood.
"Maybe we can train them to form SOS".
It's cute, but I don't see the porpoise of it!
I need to stop saying "That could never happen".
We trained them too well.
I see the entertainment made it, too!
And just after I had gotten over the seagulls mocking us.
Funny--used to be known as monkey see--monkey do!
No, thanks. I went to the 8 o'clock show.
It's life imitating life.
They sure are good. It's just a shame they go away every time a rescue boat comes.
I can't tell if it's art imitating life, or if they're just ridiculing us.
Eddie! That pod of dolphins that we saw leap off the cruise ship is back with a new routine. Don't know why they came our way but I suppose they have a porpoise.
Think we can get them to make an SOS?
Well, they say "imitation is the sincerest form of flattery".
Actually, never mind.
Hey Bob, are you sure you left your camera in the boat?
Oh, look - it's an informal grouping of the order Cetacea.
I'm beginning to think that the ability of dolphins to mimic is more than just folklore
Nobody likes a show off.
I didn't know dolphins could be so mean.
Yes, Jim, you're hallucinating.
I think I finally found a porpoise in life.
Are they waiting for our applause?
It’s hard to tell if they’re just being jerks when they always smile like that.
I hope for their next act they form into a life boat
Do you think they're trying to tell us something?
Quick, shake the tree!
Ignore them. They're mocking us!
I knew there'd be a payoff for buying ethical canned tuna.
Well, I would just as soon our life didn't imitate their art.
Meh...I've seen better at Sea World.
I can deal with no food and no water, but the incessant mocking.....
Every filet o'fish I ever ate is getting revenge on me!
Months of hard work, training the dolphins, finally pays off
They must have escaped from Las Vegas
Looks like they are mocking us on porpoise!
If this was Sea World, I'd be really impressed.
Imitation is the sincerest form of mockery.
Ok, they're mocking us.
I said shrimp cocktail.
Paul, I think there is something in that water we drank...
So much for going to get help
I thought dolphins had feelings.
I remember SeaWorld when it was just a tank and some beach balls.
Once they're done mocking us do you think they'll go for help?
So they haven't gotten help yet... this is still pretty impressive.
I promised them an audition at Seaworld when we get home.
I think we're their charades clue.
We'd cream them in Pictionary.
Their school must teach that art imitates life.
You up for some sushi tonight.
Cute, but not original.
Well, look at that. A podcast of ourselves!
I think they like us ironically.
Don't look. They're just showing-off.
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery but isn't very helpful.
Now I know they have always been laughing at us.
Stop it, you're projecting.
It's nice they're trying to cheer us up.
It's the dolphin show promised in the island cruise brochure.
You should have taught them to catch fish.
It's the sincerest form of flattery
Yeah, well the top ones are fake.
This is not a good time to be a vegan.
Also the schools are better
I was hoping for something more escapist.
I do believe they're mocking us on porpoise.
I'm not feeling sincerely flattered at the moment.
Sorry, I was wrong. They aren't rescue dolphins. They are Sea World escapees.
The little one sorta looks like you.
Who’s the idiot who said, ‘Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery?’
So, what's their porpoise in mocking us?
I'm flattered by the sincerity of their imitation but flattery gets us nowhere.
I just feel like our life here lacks porpoise.
Did you ever get the feeling that you were being mocked?
I know how we got stuck on this island, but... what about them?
Next summer I vote we go to Europe.
Since their release from captivity, the dolphins were still unclear on the concept.
Copy cat! Copy cat!
Talented? Granted. But the mockery is just so hurtful...
Now I just think they're making fun of us.
Despite their best efforts, the troop of wandering, porpoise acrobats were unable to cheer up the castaways.
Are they making fun of us?
Simon says...
Is it porpoises or porpi?
I think they are mocking us
You up for a visit to a theme park?
Now that's an island that can survive rising sea levels!
I guess mocking us is their porpoise in life.
Life is art.
Alas. No porpoise is an island.
I'II give them a TEN.
Do you think they are doing that on porpoise?
Young, bored dolphins learn the cruel but entertaining art of mockery.
That island seems awfully fishy.
Now they are just taunting us.
What gets me is how do they stay out of the water so long?
Boy, they really have a wicked sense of humor!
They say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery but I can't help but feel like they're mocking us.
I think synchronized swimming is way over overrated.
If they're smart enough to mock us, they're smart enough to send for help.
Hmmm, just musing if cartoonists get paid regardless of what they submit?
Is 'mocking' a sign of intelligence?
Let's just say that I'm not flattered.
Now they're just showing off.
So like us.
You think they're doing that on porpoise?
It's not simple mockery. I think it's their reasoned commentary on the overuse of the desert island cartoon trope.
Posers
I think they're doing it on porpoise.
Look at them. Those dolphins think they're so much smarter than us.
It's cetacean for, "And what did those opposable thumbs get you on Election Day?"
Looks like they found their porpoise.
Roger...this whole time we've been at SeaWorld.
What's the porpoise?
There goes the neighborhood.
I think they're mocking us on porpoise!
It's all fun and games until somebody gets hurt.
Remember I told you about the Mannequin Challenge?
Well, it was your idea to move here to get away from the mimes in Times Square.
Well, the last guys thought it was funny...
Those snarky dolphins are back.
Hey, George, we're here because we got shipwrecked.But, they're all here on porpoise!
Meh.
We've been reporpoised...
'Was that it for the mushrooms?'
Very impressive. Now see if you can train them to make a boat.
Uh oh. I think they want to reporpoise the island.
I see they’re clever, but I wish they’d be more empathetic and swim for help.
No, they're mocking us. It's no accident. They're doing it on porpoise.
Know what Ralph, I think there's something fishy about our situation here.
They did it on porpoise.
Amazing, isn't it? But is it real intelligence or just sophisticated imitation?
The one mimicking you looks pretty tasty.
I can't stand any more of these useless displays of cheerfulness.
Now I think they are just mocking us....
The last thing I need to hear about right now is overachieving dolphins.
I'm feeling disrespected.
While I am enjoying the show, I am getting nervous about the killer while performance at 2pm.
Look Ed, Ludibrium Phocoenidae, common name Mocking Porpoise.
Let's go to Sea World, you said. They created a new program, you said. You wanted to be a captive audience.
Those dolphin mimes are starting to get on my nerves.
now they are just mocking us
Ed, do you know about quantum continuous symmetries and corresponding conservation laws?
Well, they're either making fun of us or performing "Waiting for Godot." Either way, you should look.
Ha, the jokes on them. We have clothes on.
Honey, can hallucinations mock?
Do you ever feel like Life is mocking you?
Rethinking your vegan stance yet, mate?
I didn't say 'Simon Says'! I win!
We should have stayed in school.
I don't really see the porpoise of this.
Dolphins can be so cruel when others aren't looking.
Cute, but I still miss reality TV.
Don't throw them any more fish, Stanley. They're making a mockery of us.
They've really come a long way since we first arrived here.
Looks like Sea World's orcas have taken their show on the road
Now I know how Trump feels about Alec Baldwin.
I hate it when they patronize us!
I think we're being mocked.
Do you think they're doing it on porpoise?" "Dolphinitely.
They think you said our lives had no porpoise.
That tropical décor motif is so yesterday.
They gonna just frolic or help us?
They choreograph this, but flagging down a passing ship it too much to ask?
This whole synchronized swimming thing is getting out of control.
I think they may be phishing us!
So much for " Go get help, Flipper! ... Do you understand me , Flipper?"....
We'll see how funny you think it is when a six pack ring washes up on shore...
Quit dwelling on being rescued. Did you ever read "The Porpoise Driven Life?"
No more of your 'Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.' OK?
Brad! Seven dolphins are making fun of us on porpoise!
What started as entertainment has turned into bullying.
I liked them better when they were giving us the Flipper.
So, so sympatico.
I do believe that we are being mocked.
Is that how I look in photos now?
It's so hard to tell if imitation is a compliment or just sarcasm.
It sure makes you wonder--dolphins or porpoises?
Okay,this time let's hold hands around the tree
Now that's what I call re-porpoise-ing
Yep, you're dying.
When we hear the whistle we have to switch places.
You think that's funny?
John, look! They're mocking us again.
This morning when I looked out the cabin window they were swimming alongside the ship. I didn't take a photo because, you know, dolphins swimming beside the ship.
My kingdom for a hook
They'll let us ride them back to Sea World, but I've been there like a million times already.
Smart, huh? I clearly said "pontoon boat" not "palm tree afloat."
Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.
*You* told them you were Simon Cowell. Now make them go away.
Derivative!
I still say we should have opted for rescue not entertainment.
Do sharks like to play before they eat their food?
Sea World escapees turn the table: "Who's the trapped mammal now?"
I have an idea, Henry. Get over here and help pantomime a boat.
If we ever get out of this, I'm moving to Japan.
There's a bunch of dolphins having a good time rubbing it in. Don't get up.
Where's the harpoon?
Simon says, make some sushi.
I sent the message in a bottlenose.
Quick! Draw a picture of a cheeseburger in the sand!
They're supposed to be smart, not smart alecks!
You can take the porpoise out of Sea World, but you can't take Sea World out of the porpoise.
Oh, bravo. Now do it in Kansas.
Please don't start up with the whole "opposable thumbs" thing again.
I dare you to tell me one more time that life imitates art.
Do you think they get it?
Lacks sincerity.
You're wrong - life does have a porpoise.
The whales' one was better.
Don't go by me, I thought downward facing dog was an awkward pose
They're nice, but I ordered whales.
We just need six more people to compete.
Do you think they know they can just swim away?
I get the feeling they're making fun of us.
I know it’s cliche’, but we’re like fish out of water…
If I didn't know better I'd say they were mocking our predicament on porpoise.
Humans - mocking us? So rude.
For god's sake, stop saying "Something looks fishy here". For the hundredth time, they're not fish!"
They are very intelligent but their sense of humor is in very poor taste.
Another pun for you. Imagine if we were stranded out here on porpoise.
Does art imitate life, or does life imitate art?
Aren't dolphins supposed to be helpful?
Wonder if we can eat tuna free dolphin?
If it's not satire, then it's irony.
How long are we going to have to hold this?
And you thought topiary wasn't relevant anymore
I know we don't have much land. But what a swell lawn ornament!
I know their brains are bigger than ours - but mocking strandees is in downright bad taste!
He looks nothing like me.
Wait, are they doing this on porpoise?
I've always enjoyed synchronized swimming.
Don't look. They're just making fun of us.
Mimes. See, I told you we're stranded in French Polynesia.
Is your iPhone charged?
They really nailed our chemistry.
I wish I never said cheerleading isn't a sport.
Phil, just act natural. They won't even notice we're here.
There's a dark porpoise behind this.
It's not a mirage. There doing it on porpoise.
They can't see us if we don't move
Pic or it didn't happen.
Looks like a school of mockingfish.
For the last time, Henry! They said that they don't have any Grey Poupon!
That's just animal cruelty.
It's dolphin for no man is an island.
Let's switch sides.
I'm flattered.
Impressive but not helpful.
We've already seen that one, you unoriginal bastards!
I think it's for camouflage porpoises.
Maybe I should have kept the fish bucket for us.
That's great but ask them for a lift to the shore and see how much help they are
Just our luck, shipwrecked at SeaWorld.
It's either a mirage or lunch!
I don't mind the mocking; it's the sneering I can't abide.
I hate mimes.
Now naked women. That would be a good hallucination
I guess everyone is preparing for the Trump presidency.
You know, it's not their intelligence that bothers me, it's their mocking attitude.
Who knew dolphin mimes could be so sarcastic?
Didn't we see this same act at the last shipwreck?
I really hate installation artists
It seems like the Dolphins are beginning to play with a real sense of porpoise.
But my GPS said, "Mahi."
Ah yes, imitation...the least sincere form of predation.
And you said humor should always have a porpoise.
There's some amazing animal shows on this channel.
They must be that group that escaped from SeaWorld.
Why do those damned porpoises have to be so competitive?
No, you're the less-evolved species.
They trained at Cirque du Filet of Sole.
I don't know if I like art just for art's sake.
Um...Phil, did I ever tell you about the first time we saw Cirque du Soleil?
This is the last time I'm doing coconuts.
If they get the Sea World gig, maybe they'll take us with them.
Copycats.
This used to be such a nice quiet neighborhood.
Life imitating art.
I know the brochure said, "Quiet getaway with unusual sightseeing opportunities," but don't you think you should have checked the reviews.
I think we've been eating too many rotten coconuts.
Somebody had too much time on their flippers.
Yeah, we've definitely been here too long.
No, I think they're chunk light.
I can't tell if they're trying to mock us or amuse us.
Oh, no. More refugees from Seaworld.
Want to switch sides?
I'm sincerely flattered.
Ok . . . one-word, two-syllables, rhymes with lampooned.
Thank goodness, we must be somewhere near one of the Disney Resort islands!
So that's our fate, sea life imitating art.
...and these are homo sapiens... now on to the next island.
Good news- we're not far from Art Basel Miami.
"A joke about our sense of porpoise would really be grabbing the low hanging fruit".
Just when I thought life had no porpoise...
Try hallucinating about the Jets, you never know......
I now feel like my life has porpoise.
Well, they do have the home court advantage.
They look like us, but they're having fun
Yeah, yeah, I believe you.
Now they're just taunting us on porpoise!
Our new neighbors are show-offs.
We need to figure out how to have a lot more fun.
Looks good, but now we need to work on your facial expressions.
I already told them we had nothing to do with Sea World.
I think those two humans are trying to tell us something.
No, I'm not interested in your phantasmagorial dolpinatious fantasies at this point in time.
I don't know . . . I just feel like a fish out of water here.
Marco?
The good news is we won't have to lie when we tell this fish story.
Imitation is the highest form of flattery.
And for the hundredth time, NO, I don't have a cameraphone on me!
That's very insensitive.
Now will you stop lecturing me about all the tuna sandwiches?
They are porpoisely mocking us!
Cool! Salt water is a hallucinogen.
What hallucination?
This feels more welcoming, but what's their end game?
Something tells me that those berries we ate are hallucinogenic.
No, I don't get it either.
I heard dolphins were intelligent but I think these are mocking us.
I think they're doing it on porpoise.
This one's a real hallucination.
I'd kill for a tuna salad sandwich right now.
Its ok, I guess, if you're into that sort of thing.
Show offs.
Dolphins are natural mimics...and assholes.
Is that a mirage, or are they doing that on porpoise?
Whose idea was it to play charades?
I've flippered out!
You have this power and all you can think of is dolphins?
I'm sending a message in a bottlenose
They make it look so easy.
Dolphins do have a perverted sense of humor, don't they?
Psssttt...that dolphin looks nothing like me
Oh no! Stranded dolphins!
Intelligence, playfulness, and a proclivity for rescuing humans... I tell you two out of three is bad.
You can call it fun-loving, I call it ridicule.
I suppose it's the thought that counts.
Sure we're safe here, but over there we would be dolphin safe.
I told you that swimming with the dolphins was a bad idea!
We've reached a new low - mocked by dolphins.
Okay, we get it, you guys are clever, now can you please stop mocking us?!
Sam, they're rubbing it in our face again.
Should we try a message in a bottlenose?
Stop being such a good audience--they're scaring all the fish away.
If we could just get six other guys..
My kingdom for a harpoon!
Rescue Ships? No, we're being parodied by dolphins.
I think its an ad for seaworld
Yes they have a porpoise and clearly it's to mock us
I can't be certain, but I think they are mocking us."
If that's a mirage, maybe this is a mirage, too!
Another (ironic) example of art imitating life.
Are they teasing us on porpoise?
I've finally seen my porpoise in life...
C'est la fin.
No, it's not Cirque de Soleil but it's the best I could do.
Imitation is the saddest form of global warning.
Do you think we should decorate it?
They're mocking us, how cute.
I don't think that clapping is the reward that they were hoping for!
The Poignant Poised Porpoise Dance Troupe are back.
Think what you like, I still say they're taunting us.
I hate imitation tuna!
I guess the whole "no man is an island" thing only applies to us.
I think we've finally driven them crazy.
I thought it was 'monkey see, monkey do'.
I found the tree of life.
They're just making fun of us. Pretend you don't notice.
I told you to stop training them; we're not working for Sea World anymore.
Are you seeing this Bob?!" "No, I'll catch the 6pm show.
We could make a fortune with this.
Out of Tragedy comes Great Porpoise.
Don't look now, but I just saw our 'porpoise' in life
Something fishy about that mirage ...
Arrogant, and on porpoise.
I find it a little ostentatious for the neighborhood.
They're a shoe-in for the gold in synchronized swimming.
Not sure what they're doing but they say there's a porpoise for everything.
How can they be such trenchant satirists and still be so cute?
Well, at least they're not building the wall
I thinks they want us to visit.
If that's not mocking, it is amazing choreography!
I think they are trying to be sarcastic.
I wish we'd treated them better when we worked at Seaworld.
Random? No, they did it on porpoise.
Did you order a life raft from the Nieman-Marcus catalogue?
OK! We get you're part of a well-balanced diet.
Cirque de Mer has finally arrived.
I never subscribed to the theory of natural selection until now.
It's the caffeine in the herring.
Snap out of it Doris, what could possibly remind you of our trip to Vegas?
I guess it's better than being stranded on an island woth no porpoise
Something tells me they know more than we do.
Remind me please the difference between flora and fauna.
As Tim and Bob waited to be rescued, Bob stood there and watched the dolpins reflecting.
Harry, you won't believe this! The rescue fish are here.
a simple dinghy would be nice.
Well if it isn't the podcasters.
Or, they're auditioning for The Dolphins new halftime show.
The gravity of our situation doesn't concern them.
Now they're just mocking.
This is not Sea World ... just knock it off.
Is it just me or are they mocking us?
Really, you can't see the porpoise?
At least hallucinating keeps one going
Maybe evolution was a hoax?
I feel mocked and flattered at the same time! Plus I'm really thirsty...
That's not art, it's imitation
If we moved to Canada like we originally said, we wouldn't have to put up with this.
Oh, it's on porpoise alright.
Maybe no man is an island, but...
I'm guessing this is some sort of payback for cancelling Flipper.
I can't help but feel like they're mocking us
Enough with the clowning. Go back to Sea World and get help!
I can't stand it. Now they're mocking us!
Aren’t mirages only in a desert?
I don't know if they're flattering us or mocking us.
Just think of what they're paying to see at Aqua World.
Should I ask them if they have a deck of cards?
They swept us on synchronized swimming.
Did I eat that mushroom or did you?
- They're still there. - Yeah, there's no getting used to it...
Hey Steve, are you seeing this too?
Would you look at this? They are mocking us on porpoise!
Porpoises? I don't know, they really look like dolphins to me.
What makes you think they're razzing us?
I hate the mannequin challenge.
This mannequin challenge thing is everywhere!
Sally was again reminded that she was missing water ballet class.
I guess art does imitate life, Steve
The porpoise of art is reflecting life. Now if only we could make it reflect a life raft.
I think they are teasing us on poipose
Do I really look that depressed?
I have heard of copy cats, but.......
It is better than Ten Lords a Leaping.
It looks like they've been re-porpoised.
The artistic impulse is the only thing separating us from the dolphins.
We should move there. They have entertainment.
They're getting better and they'll keep practicing till they get it right
At least we're a meme.
And those sounds they make . . . it's like they're laughing at us.
Eight, if you must know.
Hey Ed, I dreamed about cheerleader camp last night.
I still say it's the highest form of flattery
Don't be flattered . . . they're mocking us.
Sea life imitates art.
I hate that we are being upstaged by some Sea World wannabees.
Hey John... This dolphin REALLY captures your essence.
My desert island fantasy also involves unclothed bodies
If you ask me they're jumping the shark.
They think we're pretty stupid.
Bobby, why am I always teased by everyone in a school?
Mockery is the most insulting from of torture
Great, you get one wish and rather than clearly saying iPod, you mumble and just get a pod!
I told you dolphins were a smart-assed as humans.
Do you think that they taste like chicken?
Tough crowd.
What were you saying about dolphins being highly intelligent?
Honey, do I really look like that?
I don't think they have really captured the essence of the palm tree.
They say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
"Cirque du Soleil" does it better.
Sometimes they can be just jerks.
C'mon Jeff just one more! How much bread do you have left?
This attention-seeking behavior has gotta stop.
They call it performance art...
worst part of this whole experience is the all the mockery
It's really great. You should have bought a ticket.
A camera, a camera. My kingdom for a camera.
Harry, the dolphins are showing off again.
Do you they can reconfigure into a boat?
Something is fishy about that isle.
Don't you think public art brings us all closer together?
I think they misinterpreted our message in a bottle.
What will we feed them with at the end of the show?
I think I read that mimicry is a precursor to mating.
Bob, you have to see this
Just when you think your life has no porpoise
"We all wish to be what we are not".
Okay, let's find out, once and for all, if these 'people' have any intelligence.
So, now we know; it's nature not nurture.
Maybe someday I'll see the one who plays me.
I bet they do a mean 'Burghers of Calais.'
Big surprise! The dolphin cheerleaders you wished for are here, and they're teasing us.
Remember when dolphin shaped mailboxes used to annoy you?
Have you ever wondered about an alternate universe?
They haven't blinked in days.
No, I don't want to hear about your idea for a new act at Sea World.
There is a parallel universe!
Marooned and schooled
Thought you were only suppose to see mirages in the desert?
No, they're dolphinately porpoisely mocking us.
We're saved. Animal Planet has to be close.
Our lives are meaningless without porpoise."
They've been mocking us for an hour.
Don't look now but I think they're mocking us again.
Crowdfunding with a porpoise
Honey, do you think that porpoises are capable of satire?
You can stop worrying about food and water--we've died and gone to hell.
And you thought your life had no porpoise.
Presentation schmesentation... I'm sick of sushi.
No, I'm fairly certain those are porpoises.
Quick, make like a cheeseburger!
Some say mockery is the highest form of flattery.
Are you mocking me?
I hope they aren't waiting for a tip...
They're doing that to us on porpoise.
I think a few of them are Second City guys.
I've heard of mock turtles but never mocking dolphins!
Ahh, the true mockery of captivity...
Care to watch? The dolphin show just started.
Are they making fun of us?
Dolphin see, dolphin do, ha ha
Taunting is so declasse.
They've even managed to perfect your slouch of Trump despair this time round.
So bizarrely unnatural –it’s a cellphone tower!
Dude, now even Flipper is making fun of us!
Are they mocking our situation on porpoise?
You are missing the best part of the matinee performance.
George, the SeaWorld dolphins are gloating again.
It's my first podcast.
Okay, good. Now go tell the Coast Guard that.
It's tragic, really. They keep reliving the moment they lost on "American Idol."
Why do I get the feeling they're enjoying this?
I thought we came here to get away from performance art!
Who knew dolphins were so much better at Tree Pose?
No, it seems more like mocking.
Just like I've always said--sarcasm is a sign of intelligence.
Uh oh, I made I contact. Do you have any change for a tip?
Is this something we'd understand if we had taken Fine Arts instead of Law?
I've had it with trying to keep with the Joneses.
Sea life imitates art.
I suppose we could credit them for their attention to detail.
Something's fishy about that other island. . .
I hear they're planning to build a wall.
For the 100th time, no, I don't know the difference between porpoises and dolphins.
There's something fishy about the new neighbors.
Now they're just doing it on porpoise...
I even hate dolphin mimes
They love to show off!
Those so-called experts are so wrong. Dolphins love to perform.
Convergent evolution is an amazing process.
I know it's the sincerest form of flattery but I would rather they just bring us a sandwich.
It was then that the boys discovered that dolphins had the capability to mimic and cruelly mock humans.
I can't remember -- are they mimics or mimes?
What a bunch of dicks.
At least they have a porpoise in life
It's sad that Sea World cut them loose last year.
It certainly raises questions about where inter-species communication is taking us.
Ed, I've seen my first mirage. It's an 'Edible Arrangement' of fish.
We have to improve out act.
Highly intelligent? How about a rescue instead of a show!
The dolphins are taunting again!
I know dolphins are very playful, but now they are just making fun of our little island
Are they imitating us, or are we imitating them?
My turn. What’s more annoying than a Vegas mime troupe?
I guess riding them to shore is out of the question.
No--I won't turn around for another one of your boring fish stories." "No--I won't turn around to hear another of your boring fish stories.
They think we're going to feed them.
They're showing off again.
Mirror neurons?
I have a feeling that in the next life, I will be working at Sea World.
It would be sensational, if they weren't so in-your-face about it.
Do you think we'll ever get our act together like that?
People say dolphins are smart, but I just don't see it.
I'm not laughing this time—just to prove a point.
If they're so smart, why do they always resort to mocking humor ?
Nice show, but I've seen it before.
Is that really what I look like?
As if things weren't bad enough, now they're mocking us.
I still say performance art is over-appreciated.
Art imitates reality.
Just what we need....clown dolphins
Now I think we're about to be victims of identity fraud.
I liked it better when they were doing synchronized swimming.
It's true what they say, dolphins are the most smart-ass animals on the planet.
I think we're going to lose the synchronized swimming contest.
I think they're just making fun of us.
It's tough keeping up with the Dolphins.
I don't know, I just feel that they're mocking us somehow.
We must be dehydrated because I see a fish mirage.
Their idea of camouflage seems a bit fishy.
Coach, we must be near Miami.
As they drift by, we'll take out the small one.
Too soon?
Yes, I'm sure they're doing that on porpoise.
Our last hope is by going viral on Street View.
You'd think they'd have better things to do than mock us.
A deeper form of flattery would be to damn-well whistle for help!
They're intelligent enough to mock us, but not to get us off of this god-forsaken island!
These Chinese acrobat porpoises are amazing.
We have been here too long
You're right, maybe we should've gone to Canada.
I wish Wilson could have lived to see this, too.
Look, it's the Dolphrey Ballet!
Who knew they did synchronized swimming?
What were you saying about humans being the smartest mammals?
Looks fishy to me
We never should have mentioned we were trainers.
Dolphins? Porpoises? Which one would you turn around for?
Great. Another troupe of Seaworld escapees.
I spy with my little eye...
No, I don't have a tip. So shove off!
If we had a coconut, I'd throw it at them.
And now they've made a multi porpoise structure.
They're showing off on porpoise!
It's times like this that make me wonder if my life has a porpoise.
Do they know that they aren't at SeaWorld anymore?
I might be hallucinating, but I think I see a dolphinium.
I think you'll see we have a lot in common with the neighbors.
Ocean's got talent.
Now they are making fun of us!
Sit up straight, the neighbors are watching.
Have I ever told you I hate SeaWorld?
You say they're playful, I say they're making fun of us.
Last week they did Heatherwick's Vessel. Truly stunning.
I didn't know a school of fish could literally be an art school of fish.
I know this one. It's right on the tip of my tongue. Oh geez, where is my google when I need it?
Mock us as they like, but they're the ones who taste just like chicken.
We need leaders, not followers.
Where's a camera when you need it.
I am shocked by the compassion, the mighty showmanship and too the overwhelming sarcasm
I do NOT hunch like that.
They're mimicking us because we have no porpoise in life.
Sometimes I think Sea World should have kept them...
Animal, mineral or vegetable?
Bob, I'm beginning to believe you when you say we and the universe are one.
I don't think they're as smart as everyone says.
I don't think they mean to help us.
I believe they want us to suggest a caption...
Somehow it doesn't feel sincere and it doesn't feel like flattery
Look Fred, they're ready for Trump University!
Remember when you said you wished we could take a selfie?
I get the feeling they're making fun of us.
They say they're smart, but I've never really believed it until now..
They say imitation is a form of flattery
I must admit, except for the hairline, he does look a lot like me.
"I know they're dolphins but they're obviously taunting us on porpoise".
I don't think we should have eaten those mushrooms.
They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
Well obviously they're doing it on porpoise!
Just another school of smart-ass dolphins!
To think we wasted all that money at Sea World.
They're obviously smarter than we thought...
Why us? Why them? I give up.
I told you to pack the dolphin treats, but no!!
Sheesh. I really thought that once we were out here, we could stop keeping up with the Joneses.
I see with my little eye something that is.....ah, never mind.
I prayed for deliverance and purpose and god delivered us porpoise. Not funny.
Looks like we finally have a porpoise for being here.
I think they're messing with us on porpoise.
Those dolphins are really talented but they need a porpoise.
Just when I was beginning to think that our lives no longer had a porpoise.
Until now I never realized how much my life lacked porpoise.
Everyone's a critic!
I guess they really are more intelligent than us.
i think they're okay with climate change.
I'm not looking forward to the big finish.
Is it a genius for imitation or cruel mockery?
Dude my Rorschach Test came to life.
And now they're just mocking us.
They did it on porpoise.
That's the last time I accept free tickets to a dolphin show.
I think our next door neighbors are showing off.
I think I like mimes over performance artists.
They were cruel to approach us in the shape of a boat.
C'mon, think. How can we monetize this?
Intelligence and diligence aside, their sense of humor leaves much to be desired.
With that much brain power, you'd think the message would be easier to understand...
Should I get tickets for the new show tomorrow?
'O wad some Power the giftie gie us, to see oursels as ithers see us!'.... No? Then I give up. Anyway, poetry charades is for show-offs.
Right Brain Dolphins
Next time, let's go with the all inclusive.
The fish still see you.
There's something fishy about our reflection.
It's time for you to vote me off the island.
Remember when the Coast Guard released a bunch of search and rescue trained dolphins into the wild? It's like that, but these are from SeaWorld.
I've heard of acrobats, but acrodolphins?
Do you have any change?
Uh, Bob? If dolphins can't climb trees I wouldn't fall asleep if I were you.
Do you think perhaps they are trying to tell us something?
They've given me an idea for a cartoon . . .
I know dolphins are smart and can do whatever you show 'em how to do, but I think they're just making fun of us.
Don't you think the neighbors are kind of weird?
I think this lack of food is getting to me.
Most Americans can't tell whats different in this picture
Don't take it like that... they say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
What do I see? Same old, same old
Your mirage has been re-porpoised.
If dolphins were in charge, we wouldn't be in this mess.
Geez, you'll never guess who's doing the Mannequin.
Somehow 'clever and cute' are not the words that come to mind.
Look! Cirque du Mer!
No more rum.
Sure, but to what porpoise?
They say they're practically as smart as humans, but they got one of the leaves all wrong.
Heartless bastards, but also consummate showmen--so like Bing Crosby.
Very good, guys. Now make like a boat and get us out of here.
Yes, I'm sorry we're stuck here, I'm sorry you sunburn so easily and I'm sorry - I'm not gay! - but you are missing some really really talented dolphins.
I wish I had a dollar to give to these guys.
My hallucinations are mocking me.
I hope they're beached.
Look, Timmy, I think they're trying to tell us something.
Well I have to say this burlesque is making me reconsider my position on dolphin-safe tuna.
I no longer believe our a cappella rendition of "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" has chance in the talent show.
That's just cruel.
Those San Jose cheerleaders are good.
Trust me. You don't want to be us.
I thought the saying was MONKEY see MONKEY do.
They're good, but I'm thinkin' mahimahi.
Did you see Flipper on 'Dancing With the Stars'?
The dolphins are mocking us again.
I'm not falling for that one again, Jim...
Tall one's a babe.
Yeah, porpoises are pretty smart.....why?
At least they can enjoy the rising sea levels.
Let's see if Captain Obvious can spot the difference.
I told you to ignore them, they love to show off.
Think of the money I saved not going to Sea World when I was young.
So they can't get us off- that's no reason not to appreciate them doing what they can for us.
I don't look "that" fat, do I?
Is there a workaround to post this on Facebook?
I'm no palm reader, but that doesn't look right.
Don't look now, but I think I see some Sea World escapees.
Hey, do you remember what I said about boycotting SeaWorld?
Look! Its Cirque De L'Ocean!
It's nice but frankly I'd prefer a tuna salad on white about now.
This is better than that Blue Dolphin Group
I don't know if it's flattery or mockery
Are we near Sea World?
Purest form of flattery my ass!
So this is where imitation fish come from.
Dolphin see. Dolphin do.
They're still making fun of us
It just doesn't serve any porpoise
Hey, I know how we could pass the time
They are definitely a more impressive species.
If we weren't around, what would dolphins do with their time?
No, it's no "man" is an island.
Well, I still say humans are smarter.
I think they're just making fun of us.
I don't know where we've ended up, either, but I want to say we must be somewhere near Miami.
Wow, they're not only smart but they're comedians too!
As much as I disliked the snub nosed dolphins, the mocking ones are truly insufferable
Jimmy, look, these are the best impressionists I've ever seen!
What was in that coconut I ate?
Is it just me hallucinating, or I see the ocean making fun of us.
Give me a "D", give me a "O", give me a "L", give me a "P", give me a "H", give me a "I", give me a "N". What's that spell, what's that spell???????
Just more crap from that sunken cruise ship.
And we thought we were lost.
So, the Bermuda Triangle isn't that far from Orlando?
I guess they're smarter than us after all.
Not bad, but they’re no Bellagio
I told you not to use up the phone battery!
I don't know how I feel about SeaWorld's new image
We have no porpoise.
At least we won't die of boredom.
So smart....it's a real shame we will have to eat them.
Am I hungry, or do sushi what I see?
mammal-quin challenge
Those dolphins' Mannequin Challenge is amazing; that dolphin has perfectly captured and held your despondent look for minutes!
We should have ordered the California rolls.
I didn't know Dolphins had cheerleader camp...
I think our Release Into the Wild project still needs work.
Such cruel smiles.
They can communicate - and mock us.
Are they taunting us again?" "Yeah, don't turn around.
Which one should we eat first?
I think they're messing with us. I'm starting to wonder if a cruise ship full of mackerel is really coming.
Looks like we picked the wrong week to go vegan.
Well, they do say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery...
I think the dolphins won this round, best two out of three?
I think we're being watched.
Suddenly, my life has porpoise again...
I see satire is alive and well at SeaWorld.
Our Airbnb hosts are here, again.
I finally see my life has porpoise
Are they doing that on Porpoise, Bob?
Taunting?! This borders on bullying
Hey Scott? I need a second opinion on something.
I'd say they're mocking us, but I don't see the porpoise.
You say rescuing, I say mocking.
Fate vs. Choice
Those dolphins are giving me a fishy look.
The worst part was being mocked daily by dolphins.
Look they are mocking us!
They're not mocking us, Fred, it's just their way of being playful.
I think we should release the two of them back into the wild.
Fishy sea, fishy do.
Perhaps they escaped from SeaWorld.
I guess that's better than jumping through a hoop.
I would appreciate the artistic creation much better if I didn’t feel so mocked.
I think they're trying to annoy us on porpoise.
I told you we should've taken my camera instead of your Bon Jovi collection.
No one likes a show-off.
It's Schadenfreude.
I feel like we're leading a porpoiseless life!
They move with such porpoise!
Does mercury poison cause hallucinations?
I maybe wrong, but I think we are being played.
Never felt more like a fish out of water
The dolphins are mocking us again, Steve.
Island of the Blue Dolphins meets the Island of the Blue Castaways
Who knew that dolphins can master the art of satire.
Hang on, this is just the opening act.
I'm done trying to keep up with the Joneses.
Stupid Parrotfish.
I have a feeling we've seen this one before, but there's nothing else to watch.
Do you want the good news or the bad news?
We should have them over when we get back to mainland.
D'ja ever go to Vegas?
I think our tableaux is ready.
I told you it was going to be a rough mating season.
Sea World pensioners can be SO irritating!
Look Mom, No Hands!
OK Joe, I'm getting bored watching them. It's your turn again.
They're mocking me! I hate when dolphins mock me!
Well, they do say that imitation is the most sincere form of flattery.
Sure, they're clever, but who'll they impress after we're gone?
They're Mockfish!
I've had some time to reflect lately, and synchronized swimming definitely belongs in the Olympics.
I am not hallucinating..... they are mocking us
I thought dolphins were supposed to be nice.
Since when did the Bellagio build outside of Las Vegas?
If I didn't know better, I'd think they were making fun of us.
I didn't realize that Dolphins were so insensitive to survivors rights!
Wow, now this staring contest defies all sense of normalcy.
Are they looking? Are they looking? Are they looking?
There's something fishy going on.
All they had to do was bring the rum.
Since the theme park gave them their freedom they just keep showing off.
Sure, Lassie would have swam for help, but we'd have been bored.
Those aren't dolphins, you idiot. They're porpoises.
I told you we shouldn't have let them see us eat the canned tuna
I thought I saw our shadow, but it was just a fluke.
....either that's a mirage, or, that was a baaaad coconut!
Hey, Sid, you know the theory that everyone has a doppelgänger....
Going vegan is tougher than I thought.
Do you think they did that on porpoise?
"Monkeys see, dolphins do".
No, seriously, look—it’s the second one on the right. He was at the Brooklyn Aquarium last year!
I've found my porpoise in life.
You still think my argument that "art imitates life" is too simplistic?
Hey look, Barney, they finally got it perfect ... and we didn't bring the camera!
Norm, what's the saying, 'Art imitates life? or Life imitates Art'?
I'd find that much more amusing at SeaWorld.
Why do I feel like they're mocking us.
Pssst... do you think they've seen us?
Apparently flattery has gotten us nowhere.
Ya know, I think they're mocking us.
There is an ocean of difference between a tree house , and being a fish out of water .
If they really had higher intelligence, they'd of given us a boat.
They're doing that on porpoise, I swear.
Even the dolphins know that Cognitive Behavioural Therapy works in times of crisis!
It's either great performance art or our ticket outta here.
It's interesting, but it doesn't serve much porpoise...
There must be some mistake. We ordered the shrimp platter.
If nobody finds us, we still have a lovely memorial.
,I realize imitation is the sincerest form of flatary, but I wish they would just rescue us.
Whaddaya mean look at the porpoise? What possible porpoise is there in any a' this?
Life imitates life.
See, I told you there were other fish in the sea.
Can domesticated dolphins really be happy in the wild?
I didn't know that a school of fish could literally be an art school.
I thought it was 'monkey see, monkey do'.
Mime dolphins huh? Wish they'd 'mime' their own business and stop making fun of us!
The dolphins are taunting again!
Yesterday the did a cruise ship ....
Flippant Flippers, that's all we need.
Yes, it's somehow familiar, but I still don't understand the porpoise.
Flattery? No. Mockery is more like it.
I always thought that their laughter sounded mocking.
" I bet you they are Sea World alumni ".
We'd definitely win if we could color it in.
Do we tip them, or...
“So you still don’t believe in climate change?”.
See! I told you the mannequin challenge was still a thing!
Did you just say, Why?
Damnit, Fred--you've been feeding the porpoises again!
I'm not feeling the flattery in their imitation.
You think you're funny, but you're not.
I hate being mocked!
Have you ever wondered if there's a parallel universe inhabited only by dolphins?
I thought they were friendly but they're mocking us.
What do you think they'll do when they realize we're out of fish?
What d’ya know, they really do relate.
I always knew Dolphins were smart, but not artistic.
Just act natural.
This is no time to be doing an Esther Williams performance!
Well it seems we've given them a new porpoise, at least.
Cirque de Soleil: Coming to a Bermuda Triangle near you!
I never thought I'd miss Shark Week ....
If we get out of here, I'm not buying 'Dolphin safe' tuna anymore.
Ever get the feeling we're fish out of water?
Have you ever noticed anything fishy about that island?
Really?
That settles it, life imitates art, but who is going to believe two stranded cartoon characters?
Well, there goes the neighborhood!
Oh, look! A work by Salvador Dolphin!
OK, they're good. but let's see if they can do Jazz Hands.
Either they’re signaling for help, or it’s their mating ritual. Only time will tell.
Would you please start problem solving and stop mimicking.
PETA freed them from Marineland and yet they don't care a whit about saving us.
maybe we're looking at this all wrong
Brilliant? I think they're making fun of us!!
When Sea World hears about this, we're gonna be rich.
Oh that's just great! And you forgot the cellphone charger...no ones going to see this on our Facebook feed now!
That was our last coconut " Tonight it's sushi."
Fred, I'm serious! Those damn dolphins are mocking us!
They're saying we could become a PBS sustainable donor if we act now.
If they were really friendly, they'd offer to take a message somewhere for us.
ya know, I thought this "Island Bit" would never get old...
I think Ocean World is sending a rescue team.
You have to admit, those are seven dolphins with a porpoise!
Do you think this is the transition team?
Harry, you're missing the Sea World finale.
I think it's "life imitating art"!!
We really should not have eaten those coconuts
We understand the situation.
If we ever get out of this remind me to stop going green.
I don't think we can win.
Do you have any plastic debris?
Ignore them, they're just taunting us.
Let me guess, you just got out of Sea World?
Its not imitation, its blatant mockery. Look at them smiling.
To be honest I don't see the porpoise to it.
So glad we could provide you with entertainment!
Any of you guys play for Miami?
Ginger or Mary Ann?" "Mary Ann." "Lassie or Flipper?" "Flipper. Definitely Flipper.
You're missing the point. Good species copy. Great species steal.
Did you order sushi?
Hmmm. If we can shape ourselves like a boat this could work.
Do you eat fish?
Something's fishey about this mirage
Bob, remember that giant ice cream fudge vision you had?
We're not going to win the synchronized swimming gold in the next Olympics.
OK, we're flattered, enough already.
Could we teach them to orient themselves to spell out "help"?
How many times do I have to tell you? Millennials can't be impressed.
Don't look now but I believe the end is nigh.
The rare, but extremely annoying dolphinis mockus.
Art imitates life? We don't have a life.
Great. The one thing that floats is your consignment store monstrosity.
Dolphin see. Dolphin do.
You're right! They're mocking us!
Are those fish mocking us, or what!?
You know they're mocking us.
Well, this IS a sea world.
For the last time, I don't have any fish. Now can you please get us out of here?
They might be trying to tell us something about themselves.
Do you ever get the feeling you're in a cartoon?
Ignore them - they're only being fishetious.
I think we can train them to sign HELP
Yes, I know that, but in this case flattery is getting us nowhere.
Just ignore them, their doing it on porpoise!
Bob, let's reenact the rescue scene from Castaway.
They are entertaining, but can they organize a rescue?
'I said "PURPOSES"! It's good enough for our PURPOSES!'
I notice that the humans don't have as much fun mating as us.
Is it even a mannequin challenge if nobody has a camera?
Dolphin behavior is a product of their environment.
Whether mockery, subterfuge, or intimidation, their ingenuity is pretty damned impressive!
Harold, did you call a water taxi?
We came here to get away from smart mammals, and now this!
I'll bet they wouldn't make fun of me if I was President of the United States.
"Do you ever wonder what you could have accomplished if your life had more porpoise"?
That one on this side has your exact facial expression.
It's just another audition for Sea World
Now that's an impressive Mannequin Challenge.
Their search for the rare mockingfin lead to an ironic ending.
Hey Dan, they're back again. I am beginning to think they are doing this on porpoise.
Mort they're doing synchronized swimming again
But don't forget, it's much easier to float in salt water.
'Forgetaboutit!' That dolphin does not have a crush on you.
Stand up and reach out your hand, I have an idea.
They're trolling us again.
Bo-ring! Figurative is SO 20th-Century.
The Porpoise Driven Life
About that nightmare you had involving mimes...
It's memetic theory gone wild!
Are they porpoisely mocking us?
Elaborate mockery? They really are more intelligent than we thought!
"Why did we have to get marooned at Sea World.
There may be some hope for us. I'm thinking there might be a 'Sea World' nearby.
What's that old saying, imitation is the sincerest for of what?
Mocked by mime dolphins
You'd have to pay at least 50 bucks at Seaworld to see this.
You're missing the porpoise for the trees.
Oh yeah? Well Cirque de Soleil a little closer and we'll eat you for lunch.
Uh ... bummer news on getting your own room, Ron.
Yah, and I'm seeing a mirage on porpoise.
Two words, four syllables. Sounds like dessert.
In hindsight, we should have made friends with the dolphin.
As though being here is not torment enough. I thought they were supposed to be kind, understanding creatures......
Carl, quick! Look like a boat!
Hey, look! An escape pod!
Flattery or mockery?
Wow, those six pack holders are really bad for the environment!
We need help, not entertainment. I'd trade 'em all for Lassie.
Okay, now they're just plain mocking us.
It's full, but there's bound to be another one in a few minutes.
Escapees from SeaWorld getting their revenge.
I think those dolphins are mocking us.
I've never really appreciated art for art sake.
While we were out, the neighbors redecorated.
You and your damn time shares!
Forget Canada, I'm moving there.
Take a look at the artists who won the NEA grant.
Yeah, they're mean-spirited bastards, but don't you adore their puckish grins?
I know this is going to sound fishy, but ...
They're showing off on porpoise again.
They're doing it again, reveling in our tragic circumstances.
Youse guys trying to make fun of us on porpoise?
Blame it on eminent domain.
I never did like mock tuna.
I don't know what's worse: the fact that they're being pricks or the fact that I want to book them for a show...
I can't imagine that they know we are even here
The political mocking never ends.
Reintroducing Sea World Dolphins to the wild may not have been a good idea after all!
I’m thinking they’re either Sea World escapees or really weird synchronized swimmers.
OK, now, slowly sit down.
And I thought I was a fish out of water.
There goes the neighborhood.
I don't see the porpoise in them doing that, do you?
They know something we don't.
oh that's so nice, they're trying to make us feel at home.
They said there was so such thing as "climate change" then they said there was such a thing as "climate change" and that there was an upside to it....here it is!
I told you not to do your Flipper impression.
Will you let them know that this is not a game and that we really need help…
You're still the most insufferable thing around
My grasp of reality is more like a feeble pinch.
Yeah, they are intelligent, but their ability to mock us is surprising.
Imitation is NOT the sincerest form of flattery!
Dear, I think dolphins believe Art imitates Life.
Do you happen to have a picture of a coast guard rescue craft on you?
It's either an homage or they're trolling us.
"Well, at least I got a chance to see the rare 'Taunting Dolphins".
Are we on LSD?
Their sense of humor is a little too on the nose for me.
I wish you would click and whistle once in awhile.
I am going to give them the benefit of the doubt that it is performance art and that they are not making fun of us.
I hate it when they mock us!
Those damned Seaworld dolphins have no modesty.
They must be doping.
So this is where Seaworld released their dolphins into the wild.
It's silly, I know, and I always meant to go...but I regret never getting to see Cirque de Soleil.
Despite their mocking tone, the pattern recognition and social cohesion demonstrated in such a display showed that these really were dolphins with a porpoise.
I think it's called "mocking us on porpoise."
Is it just me, or is that island moving towards us?
Stop contemplating the Porpoise of Life
2, 4, 6, 8, who do we appreciate?
Dude, look at them, humans are so weird.
Dolphin Quixote
You just know that they're doing it on porpoise.
Sea World refugees - they just don't get it.
See, I told you. Global warming won't hurt wildlife!
Joe, are dolphins known for mocking?
Calm down, John. You're just hallucinating.
I think they're missing the spirit of the Mannequin Challenge.
They think they're being funny, but I don't.
What do you suppose the porpoise of this is?
They're doing the man-akin challenge.
I think deep down they're really insecure.
Insouciant, with a soupçon of showoffishness.
I believe their trainer was synchronized swimmer.
Very funny, guys!
Are you sure our message said "Send a rescue team purposefully?"
They taunt us without porpoise.
It's your hallucination...enjoy it
At least the synchronized swimming team is getting better.
We're being mocked, and it's beautiful.
Have you seen anything unusual off the north shore this morning?
I knew that fish tasted funny.
The trouble with our relationship is that we're just not synchronized.
Savage wit, but what's their porpoise?
I was talking about the "purposes" of art.
Best mannequin challenge ever.
I think they are trying to tell us something.
Where's my camera when I need it?
Is that a trompe l'oeil or are they doing that on porpoise?
Don't give up... I'm starting to see porpoise in our lives.
Pilobolus? I swear I asked them to "Please Help Us!"
They were more fun when they were still at Sea World.
Do you think they're making fun of us?
A book. No, a movie. A book and a movie! Five words. Oh! Blue Dolphins Island! Wait, that's only three words. They're not very good at counting, are they?
Ugh, they are just so freaking superior!
It IS one their best. I just wish they'd stop trying so hard to make us laugh.
President-elect Albatross is going to bring us together.
He moved!
Sea World nostalgia.
For the last time: I don't know why they're trying to impress us.
What's the porpoise?
Ok, ok...one word, three syllables, starts with the letter C.
Jerry come over here. I think I found a mirror.
This must be that Marcel Mer Sole troupe
Why can't they use their "intelligence" to get help instead of mocking us?
Wow, the porpoise-driven life.
I already told them, we are not from sea world
Man, I could really go for a tuna sandwich.
If we could just make these interactions more useful....
Your not going to believe this
It's global warping dude.
There's something fishy about that mirage.
Porpoise see, porpoise do.
Where's a tuna net when you really need one?
those damn porpoises are making fun of us again.
I don't see a beautiful example of mimicry in nature--I see fresh meat.
1 word, movie, Castaway...
We really need to step up our charades game.
Looks a little fishy to me ....
I get they're one of the smartest mammals but there's no need to show off.
They are doing it again...
Do you think there's any chance that they could give us a lift?
That islands looks a little fishy to me
Are they trying to tell us how hopeless we look?
They think we're a 'Mannequin Challenge.'
What's the porpoise of that tree?
It's nice to know that even out here, mimicry is still the sincerest form of flattery.
Oh boy! Cirque de Porpoise has arrived.
My favorite dolphin game just got even more hallucinogenic.
Next step, a lighthouse, and we are out of here.
Those Cirque du Soleil shows are everywhere.
That does not look dolphin-safe
Never say we have no "porpoise ".
Call me hopeless, but I think that's pretty cool.
Something's fishy over there.
For such an intelligent species, you'd think they'd know that sarcasm is considered the lowest form of humor.
Do you think they're being jerks on porpoise?
Oh come on, their doing that on porpoise.
It appears as if our plight has been re-porpoised.
Some of us are here on porpoise.
This Mannequin Challenge is really getting annoying!
Performance art.
I see our porpoise .
I wonder if they did that on porpoise.
This is a fish tale that no one will believe.
Look who's making fun of us again.
At least today they're mounting each other.
So that's Porpoise Island....No wonder the British fought a war for the Falklands!
There's something fishy about that island...
So which gets your vote, Phil: "Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery" or "Ridicule is the tribute paid to the genius by the mediocrities"?
Now that's what I call marketing!
Ok, but I bet they didn't predict the presidential election.
Perhaps, group-think works better than what we assume.
Do you think this mockery is on porpoise?
Don't be discouraged, theres a porpoise for everything!
Do you guys have an agent?
They appear to be a Sol de Soleil type group trying to explain the meaning and porpoise of our predicament?
I really think they are mocking us.
The chart did say Mime Island.
Dolphin-whistle politics is the new normal.
Remember: imitation is the sincerest form of flattery
I feel like they're mocking us.
Does the one playing me make my butt look big?
Dolphin-freude.
I thought imitation was the best form of flattery, not sarcasm.
You think they are sentient creatures communicating? I think they are mocking.
I'm hearing that ominous and repetitive music again.
Earl, now they've resorted to mockery.
Now, if I could just teach them to catch fish for us.
I'd throw them a fish but I just finished the last one.
Apparently dolphins live in a parallel universe.
They must have liked starring in those dolphin shows more than we thought.
I know I made you buy dolphin safe tuna, but I'm starving!
"They came close to winning on 'America's Got Talent'".
Who the heck said that imitation is the highest form of flattery?
Are they mocking us?
I'm seeing either a good dinner or a cheap ride home. What's our current foreign policy?
I still think gorilla glue holds better.
Tom, their mocking us again!
That's the best you guys have got?
I think they are asking us to do synchronize with them
Someone's mocking at the door
I sometimes wonder: "What´s the porpoise of it all?"
I think they're Sea World escapees.
The sun's getting to me, I feel I have no porpoise..
They say 'it is better to fail in originality than to succeed in imitation.'
There's something weird about that other island, but I can't put my finger on it.
Even in the remotest of places, there is always somebody showing off.
Look,Mac -- a reporpoised island!
Hey, I think we're near SeaWorld !
If you would just ignore them, they'd probably stop teasing
I think we're being heckled by retirees from Sea World
Dolphins may think they're funny, but they're the only ones who think they're funny !!
Let's swim over to that island; it looks like fun.
Their life seems to have more porpoise.
It's the Leaning Tower of Pisces
Just our luck, Alec Baldwin Dolphins.
You think we can convince them to take a message back to Sea World?
They're actually quite good, Simon!
I guess they're capable of sarcasm as well as their other abilities.
I think they missed the point of empathy training.
I guess it's true. Practicing yoga can lead to a more porpoiseful life.
This is one of the tightest groups I've seen.
I know dolphins are playful, but now they're just toying with us.
Take 327 -no it's still not right either dolphin # 4 looses weight or we prune that tree again.
That was a big mistake you made yesterday, calling that pod of dolphins porpoises.
I least we get front row to the show.
There's just something fishy about that other island.
In your mirage, was it porpoises or dolphins?
More bad luck. These ones mock, rather than talk.
Gentrification.
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
Is this what you'd call a porpoise-driven life?
Harry, come look. They're trying to tell us something.
Cheer up, man. They made you the cute one.
I blame SeaWorld for this.
I don't see the porpoise of that.
Have you ever just wondered what's the porpoise?
They're laughing at us again.
'Pilobolus' is an even more ubiquitous phenomenon than I realized
Well I guess imitation is the highest form of flattery.
Liberated SeaWorld dolphins now use their talents for playful mockery.
wow...an island of blue dolphins
We're here on porpoise.
I told you when it sounds like laughing it's really sarcasm and ridicule.
They're trying to tell us something. Or else they're just making fun of us.
Nothing like a good dolphin mocking.
It's too fishy for my taste.
They're not teasing us, Bill. They've actually evolved that way to fool illegal Japanese fishing trawlers.
Come on, Steve. Get on my shoulders. We can do better than that!
Their island is safe from global warming.
The porpoise of art is reflecting life.
You know, it seems to me that it may be sincere, but it feels more like mockery than flattery.
They say that imitation is the most sincere form of flattery.
They can do that, but can't even bring us back to land?
I just don't know what's real and what's an illusion anymore.
If those were blue whales, that would really be somethin'!
So this is where they retire performing dolphins.
"Now that one is just plain mean!" (Mocking Dolphins pose #733)
We're being flipped off by Flipper.
Are you here for the synchronized swim pod tryouts?
Dolphin Cove's attempt to reintroduce dolphins into the wild may have been a bit premature.
I wish we were alone.
Trump must have won. I told (italics) you that he would win when dolphins become acrobats.
The hallucinations are starting, so I guess I'd be open to revisiting that cannibalism pact you proposed.
I'm impressed by their showmanship, but I hate their mockery.
So... still not budging on the whole "dolphin free" thing?
Bill, I'm telling you, they are doing it on porpoise
Proof that life has a porpoise
Nothing, just another copypod.
Remember the mannequin challenge idea you said was so stupid?
OK. Now I am ready to die.
I don't understand the porpoise of that...
...though some islands are fish.
Finally I have some Porpoise in my life...
I was beginning to despair that life had no porpoise.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
So what's the purpose of Porpoises?
I believe Dolphins might have more creative intelligence. I don't think we're getting a ride off this island.
Your dolphin looks better than my dolphin.
I'm guessing they've escaped from Sea World.
I guess their main porpoise is cerebrating his being freed from Sea World.
First guy says, "I need a sense of porpoise in my life." Second guy responds, "yeah, I'm feeling a little stuck myself."
God, I hate Henry Moore sculptures.
They are doing it again...
Hey guys, how about a lift to Miami?
I think they're saying ''no man is an island."
The mockingbirds were cruel enough.
I told you we shouldn't have kept them bottled up.
Mannequin Challenge
Honey, the dolphins are mocking us again. You'd think they have a much nobler "porpoise."
Let me know when you start seeing chips.
Well Steve, I think I see a porpoise in life.
At least now I have a porpoise.
Honey, can you remind me again what the difference between dolphins and porpoises is?
Fox News.
They must be using echolocation.
Eight fucking porpoises shaped just like us! How the fuck do you not see them?
Now they're just taunting us on porpoise!
Looky here, you just need some sense of porpoise.
I don't think they're making fun of us - I think they're just bored....
Wow. Another endolphin reuptake inhibitor.
Too soon?

It's their vacation away from Sea World.

Don't they have anything better to do then copy us?
They're from the Realism School... but I preferred the Cubists.
Now do you believe me that you look like Simon Cowell?
Wish we have could gotten something more interesting than synchronized swimming!
PREPARING FOR THE MANNEQUIN CHALLENGE
Well, this is a novel approach. All of that circling was making me dizzy anyway.
Isn't there supposed to be a penalty for taunting?
We should have them over for seafood sometime.
If dolphins were like humans, I would call this payback...
Remember how you were telling me about your parrot?
Me? I'm never bored.
They're secretly just as depressed as we are, but their trained not to show it.
They beat us at our own game!

I knew dolphins have been found to be highly intelligent but this is truly humiliating .

I it just me, or are the dolphins mocking us?
Okay, it looks a little like the palm tree we’re standing under, except with a lot of dolphins.
Their playfull swims have turnd to pure mockery.
Turn around, George. It's really nice of them to try to keep us entertained.
Honey, they’ve got mirror neurons!!!
Which one is Simon?
This must be an all inclusive deserted island.
Girl, it sounds like you've been in the sun too long.
Ugh. Just what we need, Cirque du soleil wannabes.
Sure, they are mocking us. But this is better than Sea World.
Very funny. Not!
Hey, Ishmael, here's a thought. Instead of a whale, how does a group of dolphins sound?
Mimicking our misfortune is not helpful.

They're taking this mannequin challenge too far.
Jerry's slumping a little bit. Must be off his game.
Let's play "I spy" again.

You need to get out more often.
They're more intelligent and more creative than us.
Joe, did you ever find yourself at a loss for words?
Impressive, but their vocalization mimicry might be more helpful.
I think I'll mention this to my friend Matisse.

At least our lives had porpoise.
The dolphins are mocking us. Should we be worried?
If you don't stop singing 'One Moment in Time,' I'm going to kick your ass.
Is there something called a mockingfish?
A rescue operation display would impress me more.
What's this, 'reality imitating art?' It's just not helpful, guys.
I suppose I'd be more impressed if they weren't squirting water and laughing at us like that.
They escaped from Sea World with a porpoise.
Stranded on a desert island. It's almost like nature is mocking us.

Aquatic Realism?
Funnily enough, Frank, about your feeling like a fish out of water...

Let's just call it the porpoise driven life.
I hear they can do abstract art as well.
It's just not that funny.
I think they're the ones that were released from Sea World.

George, did you call Uber?
Eight is enough.
Sorry, but I just don't believe in dolphin epiphanies anymore since the election.
Ooohhh, Dolphin Du Soleil!
I see our porpoise .
Are those dolphins playing charades again?

I think there's something fishy going on with the dolphins!

Those aquarium raised dolphins never seem to forget.
I prayed for a boat...
Who do you like this week? I have a feeling the Dolphins are putting it together now.
Looks like this was a nuclear testing site...
Dolphins also have big left brains.
Impressive, huh? But you're actually standing on Karl.
I'd still say it looks pretty fishy to me.
You know, the whole idea was that you could bring 8 DIFFERENT objects here.
This Pacific's Got Talent is getting pretty deep.
We'll have to penalize them 15 yards for poor sportsmanship.
No, those are porpoises.
What do you suppose they eat?
They can't speak. They can't write. They can only show it. They are sending a message in a bottlenose sign language.
What's the porpoise of that? I think they're just making fin of us.
Herb, these ARE the renowned imitation dolphins.
I thought they were supposed to save us; but now they're just acting deplorable.
It's a Dolphin franchise.
Have you seen my phone charger? This is amazing!

So much for a vacation on a quiet beach!
That tree over there looks delicious.
Can't... escape... mannequin challenge...
I never thought I'd say this but I'm really impressed by the new imitation seafood.
So this is what you get when you're NOT called to a higher porpoise?
I definitely didn't get us stranded on porpoise.
I don't think they care about your stupid Albacore tuna joke.
After Seaworld shut down, the dolphins had a hard time assimilating back to their primitive ways.
Hilarious. Utterly hilarious.
Oh, you guys are hilarious.
I understand Sea World had to release them.
It's their world now....!
I'm taller than that island of empathic dolphins suggests, right?
The stranded marine biologists were hoping to see the normal 'rafting formation' they've studied, but today the rarely documented empathy behavior happened to kick in.
I want to be rescued by a Japanese fishing fleet.
I find their mockery so offensive, Harold, and you won't bat an eye.
Waiting for Uber
Modern art bores me.
I guess it's "art imitates life".
Not a bad plan, but where do we find a circus?
You think the Miami Dolphins will make the playoffs this year.
Boy, I could really go for a can of dolphin-safe tuna right now!
Sure wish that synchronized swim team would come up with a new routine.
Ditto dolphin is fine, but I'm going to stick to copycat, if it's all the same to you.
How about that? Imitation IS the finest form of flattery.
Why can't you be more like Flipper?
We just can't get away from those mimes.
Ignore them. It's only a childish trick to annoy us.
So, I'm guessing your wish was to be given a clear vision of our current situation?
Nature imitating Bart.
Honey, Imitation is NOT the best form of flattery in this instance.

I knew we should have tried Canada.
I wonder what desert island records they brought.
Look, that's definitely on porpoise..

They may have removed his name but it's unmistakeably Trump.
I know, that same boring routine
The Miami Dolphins' cheerleader pickers missed the boat.
I'd imagine an art school of dolphins could mock us, why do you ask?
All the news that's fish, we print.
At least we've got food, so do you have a knife on you by any chance?
'I think they are making fun of us.'
I'll bet survivors of the USS Indianapolis didn't have to put up with this bullcrap.
If we stay still they'll never see us.
Oh, no, showboating neighbors.
Harold, why does beer battered porpoise sound so much better than dolphin and chips?
They're just imitating us!
I don't know.....something fishy about this.
Does karma apply in the dolphin world?
I don't remember seeing that yesterday.
I wish I had a porpoise-driven life
Maybe they can morph themselves into a boat so we can get out of here?
They mock us.
Amazing? Yes, but will they stick their entries?
They're trying to give us a sense of porpoise
Do you have some change?
I'm telling you, dolphins are empathic creatures!
I understand they are the world champion synchronised swimming team.
Do you still want to bet that they aren't capable of any porpoise full activity?
You're right. Its only dolphin humor, again.
Why do you think they're trying to be sneaky?
I finally got an illusion ... but ... it sucks!
They're here to save us! No wait...they're mocking us.
If art imitates life, and we are a work of art, then what do you call that?
Wow, could you guys make me a tuna fish sandwich?
In hindsight, we probably should have just eaten the fish.
This is going to sound a little crazy. But I think I just saw something.
They literally aren't taunting us on porpoise.
We're being treated very badly by dolphins, who can't even breathe underwater. Rude and unhelpful!
I always bought "dolphin safe" tuna, and yet, they taunt me.
We'll see who'll have the last laugh.
Look they are mocking us!
Land, Ho
I'm dolphin-etily starting to see things.
We said Mackerel not Mockery!
How many days have we been on this island? I'm dolphinately seeing things..
There's a great part coming up where the one sitting down acts out getting dragged into the water by a shark or something.
Oh - not that Trojan crocodile again !
Do you think we can find common ground?
I just wish I could be happy like them.
I'm starting to think maybe we shouldn't have let the Queen Mary go by just so we could see the Christmas show.
Don't move...I saw this in Jurassic Park once.
I realize now all I ever wanted was a porpoise-driven life.
This show is to die for.
That never gets old.
bro i am freaking out.
It's eerie how much their cries sound human
Who's entertaining who?
Damnit, Jerry. Now that they've won the election, the right will NEVER stop mocking us.
They were hoping to meet Ed Sullivan
Yeah, but can they mime that they're in a box?
They mean well.
Very funny smart fish - now take a hike
Now is not the time to mimic us.
At least it's figurative masturbation today.
Cliff, I'm beginning to see some empathy here.
I often think about my porpoise in life...
And I thought it was supposed to be raining cats and dogs!
Wow! Cirque du Dauphin just for us.
And, they saw dolphins are more intelligent.
Their only option: to ponder life's porpoise.
All we've gone through and they wouldn't even give us seats in the splash zone.
Art imitating life imitating art.The difference between life and fiction is that fiction has to make sense.
You think they have any spare chargers?
Just wait until a helicopter comes by.
Are they trying to help us or mock us?
It's always about us.
So why can't they spell out SOS on a sandbar?
Looks like porpoises have a real purpose out here.
They're mocking us again, Ralph.
Until now my life had no porpoise.
I'm really tired of being ridiculed by those creatures.
Deja dolphin vu!
They must have escaped from Sea World!
Life imitates life.
They said they'll continue to mock us until we give them herring" "Ask if they can do a boat.
Wow. There really is sun-kissed tuna.
Yes dolphined are smart, but do they really have to mock us like that?
It's like they were mocking us....
This is so boring, I wish I was at Disney
You wanted to see the world. Will you settle for Sea World.
John, I need more time off.
Do you remember when all those dolphins escaped from SeaWorld? I think I found them.
It is not a mirage of fish, it is a mirage of mammals.
Talk about ill-timed mimicry!
Are they sustainable seafood?
Don't despair. I think there's a Sea World is near here.
Dolphins pretending to be a palm tree? What a day.
If I just had Snap!
Very funny. I hope one of their noses lands right in your blow hole!
Helen, pick a cod, any cod!
Have I got a story for you.
Did you know that dolphins are known for being playful?
You probably shouldn't have imitated their cute little noises. Instead of helping us off the island, now they're just mocking us.
They say that imitation is the highest form of flattery" OR "What's the porpoise?
Come on guys, quit showing off. This isn't Sea World.
Now I know how people in flyover country feel.
I think I told you Jerry, if I have to look at another fish, I'll turn into one
Imitation is the greatest form of flattery...
I knew dolphins were smart, but not architects!
What is the porpoise of life?
Honestly some deserted islands have all the fun!
George, do you agree with Charles Caleb Colton that 'imitation is sincerest flattery'?
Quick look! They're back!
It's gotta be a mirage!
If I'm not mistaken, I think they're trying to cheer us up and instill in us a sense of porpoise.
Hey Ed, I think I just flippered out.
Mannequin Challenge
Imagine - GMO's way out here!
In retrospect, Fred, rather than arborsculpting, you might have considered carving us a boat.
Um...they're not helping.
Look, an arabesque for us. What does it mean?
Sea World’s renown ocean mammal training techniques may be a tad overrated.
I always believed performance art imitated life but now I see it differently.
I've been thinking... there is a PORPOISE in life for everything.
At least their not in the shape of a beer bottle anymore.
Your last bottle's message begged for a water fountain?
I know you're mammals but it's not nice to ape.
I say "Fish or cut bait."
I'm more impressed than scared.
Do you think they will let us ride along when they play Tampa next week?
I don't mind them hazing us, but I hate the smiles on their faces.
Sorry guys, but marine art isn't really my thing.
Hey Wally, you've been to Sea World?
George, I think we are saved, or at least being entertained."
Imitation is the best form of flattery.
They can copy our formation, but at least we can take this show on the road.
How sweet. They are putting a show for us.
Look! They're saying I have a big nose!
Well, I guess we don't have to worry about those released Sea World whales now, either.
I have a really bad feeling that the election didn't go the way we thought it would.
So they can mock too.
Miami 2024: Since the US withdrew from the Paris Climate Talks, the porpoises have been practicing this gesture of consolation. But Bob still thinks they're "gloating."
They've not as nice as I thought they were.
if this is your idea of date night, I'm not interested.
Perhaps their brains are so advanced they are capable of "mocking compassion."
Either I am hallucinating or we are marooned at Discovery Cove in Orlando.
Ever hear of the marine mammal mocking mirror revue?
They're making fun of us.
Sure, it seems odd, but I bet from the right angle they would look just like us on this island.
Ah...dolphins ain't so smart.
Look, those jellyfish are spelling something out over there...'Any similarity to actual persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental.'
I said “Aix île” , not exile. Even THEY understand!
Land! err... Dolphin HO!!
Do you think they're mock fish?
They were part of Cirque du Soleil's underwater troop .. we may be able to teach them to spell out S-O-S.
I can't stand it, they have all the luck, even if there is a high tide.
I thought there was only one Flipper.
Smart-ASS is more like it!
...and there are women on it.
Don't you sometimes feel like life is utterly without porpoise?
Do you do card tricks?
Do you think the neocortex and cerebral cortex of the bottlenose dolphins are particularly large with convoluted folds similar to those found in human brains and strongly associated with intelligence?
At least they stopped doing that damned gigolo cheer
I liked being stranded before the Sea World expats--damn show-offs!
They seem to think this is Sea World.
They're only happy because they have the Wi-Fi password.
Well at least some of us are concerned about rising sea levels.
They know Art Deco will captivate the cruise crowd.
I'm not flattered!
I don't know why, but I just came to wonder - is there a purpose to our lives?
I can buy cavorting. But this is cruel.
Who knew that dolphins are mimics with a sense of humour?
Purposeless. Porpoiseful!
Great art class models this week!
Quit talking about Sea World. Wishing won't make it happen.
Oh, great. Mimic Dolphins.
Next time maybe a more helpful message in that bottle, eh, friend?
Great.The Russian judge is gonna love this.
She doesn't even look like me.
Remember when I said, 'wanna switch sides' and you said, 'kiss my ass'?
I'm starting to think National Geographic just make it up as they go.
I don't care if they have no scales and will consider them Kosher, let's eat
By golly, they're copying our pod cast.
Wow, they are great at charades, but lousy at finding rescue.
Hey Earl - I think the sharks are trying to tell us something!
What we call synchronized swimming, they probably call cheerleading.
Hey! That's my likeness! Cease and desist!
The winner will be announced soon.
Oh yeah, if I were hallucinating would there be an alternate dolphin universe mirroring our every move?
I miss my iPad.
Craving human meat, the dolphins sprang into action
No man is an island...
I’m waiting for the turtle.
I think we are about to be rescued by a group of unemployed Atlantic City casino workers
And you thought my degree in oceanography would never come in handy.
Don't look, it makes 'em nuts
Sincerest forms of flattery speaking, right now I'd settle for rescue rather than imitation.
Quick, act like you're a pizza.
I feel like fish tonight. What about you?
Get on my sea level.
Do I still have time to change my vote for best mannequin challenge?
Did we buy tickets for cirque del dolfin?
Those damn mockerels are at it again...
Teamwork makes the dream work.
Hey Al, I think I'm suffering from Post Flipper Syndrome!
I TOLD YOU ISLAND LIFE WON'T BE BORING.
My god I am bored
Mom always told me that flattery had a porpoise in life!
Either I'm hallucinating or we're being mocked by escapees from SeaWorld.
Looks can be deceiving, can sharks masquerade as porpoises?
I give up, we're stranded on a deserted island and we can't even win a mannequin challenge.
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
Don't move Hank, we're getting closer, I knew we could find some tuna safe humans.
Again with the mannequin challenge?
'The accomodations are lacking but the entertainment is fin-omenal.' Oh, that Yelp is always so spot on.
Day 17: I don't think the humans suspect a thing.
Hey, do you think they're mocking us?
That’s good. Now, you on the floor, recall the shame you felt that day you led your beloved brother into the gill net.
Man, I can sure go for some mahi tonight.
Lets try making a boat shape,we maybe able to sail off .
They used to have an act at SeaWorld.
There must be a SeaWorld near by.
Great, another Mannequin Challenge.
Why? I don't understand the Porpoise...
Why not?
Bob, what exactly did the wrapper on that candy bar say?
You know, everyone always says that dolphins are so smart, but I've always found performance art to be the stuff of imbeciles.
Synchronized surviving.
I am so over dolphin art.
It's the neighborhood welcoming commite It's the neighborhood welcoming commitee
LOOK DOLPHINS WE MUST BE CLOSE TO LAND !
I think I see land.
I always knew it would come to this
Don't get taken in. I bet they trumped it up to fool us.
Sure, I like it but how about teaching them a new finale to the routine?
That SeaWorld crowd is back to taunt us again
You call them 'intelligent'. I call them mockery mammals.
Larry and Karl soon regretted not eating more tuna salad as youngsters.
Can't we have a little privacy, please!?
I guess they didn't understand what I meant by 'flair.'
I think they've beaten us in the Romanesque Column Capital category.
So what if you're Cirque du Soleil, big deal!
"I feel like we have no porpoise anymore".
Thank you for the sincere flattery.
I cannot wait for this viral video thing to be over with.
Wake me up when they start dropping coconuts.
I think help is here!
Guess that seals the deal.
We should stop eating dolphin sashimi, Gary.
"Imitation is the highest form of Flattery",....... I still feel like they are mocking our little Island !
People around you change and act based on how you behave.
I spy some purposely posing Porpoises.
If that's what this island is made of, then I'm in the water.
It must get really boring around here after a while
Maybe they will take us home.
There is something fishy going on here. Very fishy.
It could be worse.
Well finally, a Supreme Court that can decide things 4/3
I said we need purpose not porpoise!
Our island is much more stable than theirs.
Pyramids cannot hold up for long, and they should know better.
I've heard of copycats, but copydolphins?
I'm in the mood for a tuna fish sandwich
An independent study discovers that a strict diet of Mahi-Mahi can cause hallucinations
It must be a mirage.
The result of legalizing marijuana on the island
Look Peter! The Porpoise Precision Pantomime Players are practicing their performance again!
It's called the 'Busby Berkeley Effect'.
I found the dolphins!
We've only been here a few weeks, but the neighbors seem to like what we've already done to the property.
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
I wish we were over there on Carnival's private island.
At least some of us can swim away.
I can tell that we'll grow to like this place.
I've always suspected dolphins are unreconstructed satiric optimists.
Showoffs...they must think were filming Castaway 2.
We have no choice in the matter, but those two look to be stranded on porpoise.
Either they're mocking us or practicing for the next Olympic games.
Oh, great ... Sealand dolphins!
I'm thinkn' seafood for dinner.
That's one way to spend the time while waiting to be discovered.
It looks like dinner to me.
I'd prefer sharks.
I know I asked for a flotilla, but this is ridiculous.
I wish they'd get closer.
They finally broke out of the R.I.P formation.
Does Cirque du Soleil have a dolphin rehabilitation program?
There is nothing very entertaing to look at since my cell phone battery ran out of charge
It's one of those Icelandic public art things.
Doppelganger.
Do you click and whistle like a dolphin? Now's the time.
Maybe they have coconuts!!
I think they are doing that on porpoise
I don't understand why all tuna isn't dolphin safe
I never saw this at Seaworld.
If they really want to be helpful, they'd swim out and find someone to rescue us.
They'll do whatever I tell them. Cool, huh?
I'd heard that they were great mimics.
Give them a mackerel and they'll never leave.
Do you get the feeling that they are mocking us?
They're a volunteer group providing entertainment to reduce stress!
Why would I want to look at something just like this island?
Don't tell me...you're seeing a dolphin mirage.
I think their making fun of us.
At least they didn't go for the family name in gold letters.
Tell them to go back to Sea World!
Now what's wrong!!
It's deja vu all over again.
Didn't an aquatic circus cruise ship get shipwrecked recently?
Perspective is everything
If only they'd learn how to rotate and fan us.
I believe they are mocking us as superior life.
Assume the formation so they don't notice us!
Well, I think I'm seeing a mannequin challenge.
So Tres outre and yet banal. Was Jeff Koons here last night?
Esther Wiliams would be proud...
I'm not quite sure they're paying attention.
They're known as the Flying Wallendas of synchronized swimming.
Friendly, sure, everyone knows they're friendly. But who ever thought they could be this entertaining?
What porpoise does this serve Marino?
Conway, someone's making fun of us.
Don't look ... it's the Seaworld Travelling Show ... they'll never leave.
I've never wanted tuna fish so badly in my life.
Those 'clowns of the sea' sure like to punch down.
Looks like migrating is more enjoyable than immigrating.
No, you're not hallucinating... for whatever the reason, the porpoises have made us part of their tableau vivant.
Hey, I visualize us in a better place right now!
It's so sad---Sea World phased them out...
I guess you'd call it dinner theater at the Mirage?
I think it's time to merge the tribes.
Who knew they were mime artists?
The smell will kill us before starvation.
Wow, the sun really must be getting to me!
Performance art can truly reflect on our sorry existence...
Next summer I vote we go to Europe.
Yes, but are they blue?
I told you dolphins are intelligent. I just didn't know they are mocking jerks.
Thar she blows
Copy Cats or Dolphins?
That reminds me, I think I left the iron on.
I thought SeaWorld closed down their shows?
Looks like the neighbors copied our Christmas decorations again.
Cultural collision course
I like when they do the doggy.
Make fun . . .we'll have you for dinner!
Imitation is the sincerest form of fishery
I think we're near Sea World.
I didn't realize we were zoned for Entertainment.
One of us needs work.
" Hey Mike, yeah Fred? Im so hungry the trees are looking fish.
Stop watching, man! We have no fish to pay for this, and even sharks know that nobody stiffs a dolphin.
Ya know, there may be more intelligent life here than where we should be going!
Looks like California's legalized marijuana.
We've been invited for dinner at a nearby island.
I didn't know they could reproduce that way.
Please tell me 'escaped the mannequin challenge' isn't the only thing left on our 'pro' list.
The dolphins are mocking us but I always look forward to the show.
So that's what big data looks like.
Supposedly, they're quite intelligent.
I never realized the irony of porpoises was so drenched in irony.
You give me purpose everyday -- You give me porpoise in every way
I think they're beating us at the Mannequin Challenge.
My hallucinations are not on porpoise are they?
What did you say Sea World did with their killer whales when they shut down the show?
No, not after watching "The Cove"
All dressed up and no where to go
Shamu-wannabes!
And you said we should vacation in Las Vegas!
The dolphins are amusing, but now I'm craving mock turtle soup.
Do you think they are now genetically predisposed to entertain us,or are they making fun?
Quick! How can we look like a rescue boat?
Now only if we could make our island spell HELP.
At least our island doesn't smell like dolphin.
It's a mock island.
Bloody cheek!
Who knew they'd be so good at truth or dare.
bruh, their mocking us.
You need to shave.
Dolphins suck at satire.
When pigs fly...
Entertaining...? No, I think they are mocking us!
Poised for purpose
No, It's got to be a Banksy.
Well, I think the whole thing is kinda fishy.
I think this species is in danger, Ed.
They’re pantomiming, ‘Global warming will flood your island.’
Don't look now but I think there is a school of camouflage sharks coming this way!
Thompson, your'e fired! Now, make like a tree and get outta here!
You know, being vegan is not as boring as they say
Dolphinum kitschii
Do you ever get the feeling someone's watching you?
THEY'RE NOT THE COAST GUARD, BUT THEY'RE CLEVER!
It's worse than you think. We're in Seaworld.
Alright already, so we voted for all democrats...don't rub it in!
Dolphins: You didn't see anything...
Roger, see? I told you if we rewarded them with fish treats, we'd change their natural behavior.
Who needs "SeaWorld"?
No man is an island...
Look! Lunch has never been this entertaining.
It's perfect...and I'm sorry that I ate all that tuna...
I believe we were stranded here on porpoise
You're gonna need a bigger island.
Do you think they're mocking us?
They may not be able to talk, but they can sure troll.
Nowadays Hollywood is everywherer.
Oh yeah right, a Porpoise Tree!
No help for us. They've just escaped from The Aquarium of the PACIFIC
Dolphins have more advanced mirror neurons than we do!
"Mirage , Mirage , on the sea " .......
They must have have misheard when I said, "Art imitates life."
Over the years Pilobolus has gone from innovative to downright annoying!
I think I know which part of bread and circuses they're offering. We have to choose between parody and comic relief.
Have you ever been to SeaWorld?
Why are you pouting? They are giving a beautiful show just for us!
I thought something seemed fishy about it....
I must have missed this part in "The Cove."
Uh... Jim? We've been on this island too long. I'm starting to see things.
Are they mocking us?
Mimicry mimicry mock, the fish put up a stalk. Throw them a rock, watch them fall off. Mimicry mimicry mock.
Look- the guys on the other island got rescued by a shark; some people get all the luck.
Their either playing a game of charades or just making fun of us.
They're really very sincere about it.
I hope we can find a common porpoise.
Stranded in the ocean, mirage transforms to new phenomenon known as a "fishage".
Glad to see Cirque Du Soleil is finally embracing aquatic mammals.
IIIIIIIIt's TRUMPtime!!!
I caught their act at SeaWorld last year.
Jeez..And I thought CATS could do Amazing Balancing Acts
Not rescuers they're rescue monitors.
Wow, I never knew Cirque Du Soleil had a water show!
Now, how do we get them to imitate a boat without being able to build a boat?
They're mocking us. I can hear that dolphin laugh times seven.
Frank, you're not doing it right. The human looks more surprised.
I could be their manager and agent if I had a contract agreement with us.
Let's get it on.
It's a shame. These dolphins are so unimaginative.
I'm beginning to think you're doing that on porpoise.
I suddenly have a craving for dolphin fin soup
Feel like sushi tonight?
So, they ditch their job of holding up our world to practice pluralistic acro cheer?
Would love to have some popcorn with this show.
Something's fishy about the island.
Wanna see our porpoise imitation?
The dolphins have invented yet another Olympic sport: Synchronized Imitation.
I just can't put my finger on it, but I think there is something fishy going on here.
Honey, look! I think I've found the porpoise of life.
We never talk anymore...it's like you're distracted on porpoise.
The Imitation Game
They're part of the Dolphin Synchronous Swimming team.
And you had to paddle to this one!
No cocoanuts. Must be Ladies Night.
Oh look, they're building another island for more castaways. We'll have some company!
Now they're doing it on porpoise.
did they learn that from trump university ha ha probably not that was a scam #feelthebern2016
Darling, would you mind if I have some 'me time'?
amidst the ocean people still believe we are stronger together
I think they misunderstood it was just a Disney cruise.
Here come our rescue dolphins.
The South Seas Synchronized Swimming Dolphins score a 10 while playing with stranded folk.
Never cry dolphin...
PETA should see this.
Something fishy is going on over there!
Porpoise Dilecti
No, silly, it's a mirage. Sharks can't be that smart.
There's still no rescue on the horizon, just a derivative school.
Ever wonder what dolphins taste like to other dolphins?
You think you're so smart? Can you do this?
Of course they were trained. Try Spanish.
Let us entertain you!
They're literally begging for your favorite road rage gesture.
I don't know about you, but I am not feeling flattered.
They always said dolphins show great empathy.
"Now that's an eye-pod!".
I'm pretty sure these guys don't belong to the common dolphin species.
Answering their questions about postmodernism looks like a dead end.
Quit worrying so much, we must be close to SeaWorld.
They seem a bit stand-offish
"Out here the show comes before the meal...AND THAT'S US!!
What do you suppose the porpoise of this is?
Five, six, seven, eight! Who do we appreciate?
Mereswine, schmearshine, I wanna see the dancing girls!
On second thought, it could be worse....
I think their cartoonist must have taken some crazy improv class.
No rescue boat, just those bottlenosed copy-cats again.
Do you think we could do that?
Hey, Bubba, check out the knockers on these mermaids.
I think it's an operetta. Is there an HMS Semaphore?
Those sperm whale could really use me. You don't mind, do you sweetheart?
they are mocking and taunting us
Hey Harry, I think there is something fishy going on!
We'll tell them we eight dolphins to survive.
Wait! I've seen this troupe before. In the next act they become a boat and take us to shore.
Ooohhh...Ahhh...
They claim they started the Mannequin Challenge craze.
Look it's dolphins taking the mannequin challenge!
Actually, they're porpoises.
They must be Parrot Dolphins.
Jake, is there any porpoise to our life on a desert island?
They can even mime.
Aren't dolphins clever? They're singing, "Let Me Entertain You" from "Gypsy".
Everything is more balanced out here
Let's see your tap-dance routine.
Dolphobolus!
I told you not to drink the salt water again Frank...
Who says dolphins can't empathize?
Clear blue undrinkable water, fruitless tree, sun-kissed sand scorching me - I feel nature mocking my plight...
Well, I don't think they're very funny!
You said you didn't feel challenged anymore.
Okay, I get it. There is a downside to evolution; but do they have to keep mocking us?
They sure jumped through hoops to do that.
Tarter sauce... Tarter sauce... My kingdom for some tarter sauce...
Well, I guess this is the last Dolphin Encounter I'll ever experience.
What's the porpoise of this?
Welcome to our full emersion dolphin language class.
I hope that someone gets my message in a bottlenose.
At least they won't starve to death.
I sense that they are sympathetic to our situation.
Look at these descendants of Trump mocking at us as if we are disabled reporters!
I can't tell whether those are dolphins, or porpoises.
Wow, Cirque du Porpoise is in town.
Yes I only eat dolphin safe tuna also.
hey dude are you also seeing this
Oh great. Eight mocking fish for neighbors.
Mannequin Challenge on point.
Are you teasing us on porpois?
Steuben?
The Dolphins have spoken. We're doomed!
What is the porpoise of mocking us?
I always knew my life was in need of a guiding porpoise.
Sure looks fishy to me !
Even the dolphins are mocking us now. So much for my support of dolphin safe tuna.
No worries. Global warming isn't real either.
I think we've had enough time alone to reflect
You ran down our cell phone battery taking video of their Mannequin Challenge?
They're screwing with our heads.
Lassie may not have been smart enough to reimagine Mummenschanz, but she'd get help.
I can't believe someone designed a prosthetic flipper for these jerks.
They're dolphins, not fish. We can't eat them.
All I said was the mahi-mahi was delicious.
Hey Larry! Remind me when we get back home to punch the guy that said "dolphins are the smartest animal in the world".
Look out. It's a trap. They're carnivorous.
Those dolphins are being really shady.
Take a look at the artists won the NEA grant.
Mirror Mirror of the Sea, who's the prettiest palm tree of them all?
Mirror, Mirror on the wall, which one is Flipper, after all?
I guess that island identifies as dolphins.
I do believe they are porpoisely mimicking us.
Man: This isn't helpful. Dolphins: This isn't helpful.
They are evolving mockery!
Do you think they're doing it on porpoise?" "Dolphinitely.
I forget; which one has the bottlenose; porpoises or dolphins?
They were using a self-stick before.
But thanks to this, I'm beginning to see porpoise in life.
They're mammals too. But humans? There goes the neighborhood!
Bob, these dolphins must be from Sea World.
I wish they'd echo-locate their little island elsewhere.
Nice try, however we are not impressed.
They seem friendly.
Don't let them con you into another stupid feat Michael!
"I think one just said na na na poo-poo".
I guess they're right. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
The Sea World training came in handy.
Hey, Jimmy, I have a million-dollar idea for when we get back.
Did you order that animal act you saw on Amazon?
They will be leaving soon; they are just showing off.
It's entertainment, to them.....
It would be nice if I could watch a dolphin water show before I die...
"Please stop trying to cheer us up about being stranded by performing a mannequin challenge".
Fish mimicry. Who knew?
Don't these porpoises know when to quit?
We can really learn a lot about teamwork from our neighbors.
Those are some meme porpoises.
Hey, I've got a great idea for a lampstand.
Maybe life still does have a porpoise. -
Why did they give me the dolphin with the longest snout?
Try making those beeping sounds. Maybe they'll get help.
Unfair. We need to call a lawyer. That was our idea.
You wouldn't think bringing us some fish would be such a hard sell.
Should not have eaten the brown acid.
Remember when you told them to make like a tree? Nice work as always.
Watch out. She's pollinating.
Maybe if we learned to support each other, we would live as long as they do.

Nah, I don't feel very flattered. You?
This must be the famous dolphin mime gang.
The guys upstairs are giving me a headache.
Do you think they're making fun of us? Because they are free to leave, we are stuck on this small piece of island.
