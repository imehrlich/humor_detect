Not my desk, you idiot! The chair!
Not another hostile takeover.
I need to take this. It’s my wife.
Put him through.
I'm sorry, I have to take this.
How are you at crisis management?
If you can pull it out of the desk, you’re hired.
As you can see, I've been having problems with my desktop.
We’re in the midst of a hostile takeover.
We’re being hacked!
Quick! Your pen!
Excuse me, I have to take this.
“OK! OK! The pen is NOT mightier than the sword!”
Hostile takeovers used to be less hostile.
Damn popup blocker never works!
As you can see, I’ve been having problems with my desktop.
Not now, Arthur.
We've been hacked!
It says here you thrive in stressful situations?
You call that a letter opener? This is a letter opener!
Darn it Mary!, I told you to hold all my Gauls!
This is why I hate working knights.
Johnson, I wish you would use the suggestion box like everyone else.
I said hold my duels!
Maggie, how do I shut off the automatic letter opener?
Executive training is quite different here at Excalibur.
The hostile takeover has begun!
Now Edwards about your severance package...
Larry, we are still negotiating! It's not time for Plan B.
Ed, you're only supposed to come out if he says he's going to audit us!
Don't be silly, I'm not giving you the ax.
This is what is called a hostile takeover.
Looks like the knight shift is here.
Don't make me take out my pen.
This is NOT a roundtable discussion!
And when I say, 'significant cuts', I mean, significant cuts!
Uh-oh. Hostile takeover!
You should see the pen!
...and if I'm lying, may God strike me-- AHHHHH!
I've told you before! Don't summon me at work!
Point taken.
Let me explain why this company is called Excalibur.
NOW do you see the point?
Looks like we're in for another round of cuts!
I'll show you budget cuts!
You idiot! Three knocks means through the chair, not the desk!
Its the Lady of the Desk!
Now I'll tell you about your severance package.
I remember when they banged on the ceiling with a broom stick.
If you’ll excuse me, I need to take this Gaul.
Bring me the Excalibur file.
Cut the dramatics! Send a tweet.
I guess nothing is set in stone!
Peg, bring me my shield and hold any calls.
You raise an excellent point.
I told you to hold my Gauls!
More cuts are coming.
They've broken through the glass ceiling.
Not now Ivan, when he reaches across the desk!
Charlotte, bring my mighty pen, ASAP!
I said I'd knock twice when he leans over to sign!
My pen is still mightier!
More cuts are coming.
I told you I'll meet you at the lake.
No Miss Simms, a letter opener, a letter opener!
Dammit, Anderson, this is not the kind of breakthrough I asked for!
Quick! Summon the Board! It's a hostile takeover!
I don’t care how much money we lost! It’s not my sword, and I won’t fall on it.
This is our latest cutting edge technology.
Never buy anything called 'Damocles' at Ikea!!
You have to be prepared for hostile takeovers coming from anywhere.
And you said the pen was mightier than the sword...
Do you still think the pen is mightier than the sword?
I'd like to take a minute to show you our cutting-edge technology.
Point well taken.
Ha! Missed me again!
Don’t make me get my pen.
Not when I am in a meeting, Cato!
Wrong floor! Lady of the Lake tryouts are on
That's not what I meant by cutting edge technology!
Johnson, I'm announcing a new round of cuts.
Cheryl? We’re gonna need a round table.
This is NOT a Roundtable discussion!
No, no! His name is Arthur King.
Hostile takeover.
This is NOT a round table discussion!
Don’t worry. I have a pen.
All I asked for was a letter opener.
Last question: how are you with a sword?
Of course I wasn't interviewing him for your position!
Dammit Damocles not now !
Welcome to your exit interview
Pull the sword out and you’re the next CEO.
For the last time Arthur, stop interrupting my meetings!
We're starting you out on the knight shift.
Not to worry, I have a pen.
How do you keep getting past security?
The board insisted upon a more visual approach to budget cutting.
Sorry but my round table meeting is starting.
The point is Newman, we're going to be making some serious cuts around here.
Well that pen ain't mightier than this sword!!!
I will not tolerate a hostile work environment!
Well, apparently, the pen isn't........!
Now do you see my point?
See my point?
All I wanted was a pen…I don`t need to be reminded which is mightier.
Somebody get me a pen!
Impressive resume, but how do you manage conflict?
I know the pen is mightier than the sword - if only I could find my damn pen!
No, Miss Faversham, I said Arthur King is here
Now do you see my point!
You might want to sit on your briefcase.
Last question: how are you with a sword?
Good God, Hawthorne! You are the one true Accountant!
I said we'd talk about this when I get home.
Down Damocles! He's not selling life insurance.
Alright Bob, time to see how much of a 'team player' you really are!
Not now, Peggy!
You were saying, What is mightier than the sword?
Deskalibur!
Not now, Mother! I'm in a meeting!
Not yet, Excalibur! If he refuses my offer, I’ll text you.
no,i said there would be no hostile takeover.
Dammit, we're overthinking the letter opener project.
Don't panic Johnson, I'll take care of this. Just let me get my pen.
Welcome to your exit interview.
For the last time Larry, I don't need more life insurance!
That's it! The killer app!
Behold! My
Whoa! My
Not until I say 'You're fired!'
Let's see what our attorneys have to say.
I guess the Barbarians got past the gate.
Hostile takeover!
Will someone please tell the Lady of the Lake to get a damn GPS!
And when I press down like this- Voila!
I said to hold all my calls to arms!
Don't make me show you my even mightier pen!
Daily mail, Stevenson. Not Holy Grail.
No, I am not Spartacus. He's on thirty-two.
Yes, renting space over a theater does keep the overhead low.
There's nothing to the rumors of a hostile takeover by Excalibur Corporation! Nothing!
Damn it. I meant Three Musketeers, the candy bar!
Well, Counselor, why don't we ask Lady Justice?
Of course you realize, this means war.
The barbarians got past the gate.
Not to worry, I have a pen.
Let's cut through the small talk.
For the hundredth time, 'No! My old letter opener is working fine!!'
Accept it Brewster...you're fired, he's hired.
This is not what I meant when I asked for staff cuts.
You idiot. I ordered a ploughshare!
It's my 'Cut thr Crap' sensor.
You're squired!!
Arthur, if I told you once, I’ve told you a hundred times, when I’m in conference the only way to get my attention is with a text.
Handle first, Jensen! Handle first!
Oh No. I forgot the
Excalibur is on another floor.
Dammit, I told you we don't mention performance incentives until the candidate has been hired!
Once, could you come in the door like a person? Once.
I should have never told Jim to spearhead the project!
Lady, how many times have I asked you not to try to reach me at the office!
You fool, you missed the damn chair.
Not yet Arthur---another thousand years!
Your hiccups are STILL not gone?
That's NOT what I meant by 'stick it to him!'
Well, that's one fewer thing hanging over our heads.
Say hello to Bob, our corporate raider.
Don't you ever knock?
What's your problem Damocles?
Oh, that's my two o'clock.
I said, no interruptions!
I said it was mightier and I meant it.
NO! I cancelled the Sword of Democles!
Excalibur, your ass!
Arthur, cut the crap! Wrong time, wrong place.
That's not what I meant when I asked you to be incisive!
The Lady of the Lake is having a hard time adjusting to the corporate world.
Whatever you do, Jenkins, don't have your letter opener enchanted.
Wait until AFTER they've accepted!
What part of 'NO INTERRUPTIONS' don't you understand?
I have other vendors who would kill for this account.
Are you going deaf, Agnus? I said REgard, not ON guard!
Last week it was a backstabber.
Every time... cheap Norwegian furniture!
I have had it with these team building exercises downstairs in HR!
How big do you think my envelopes are?
When I agreed to use your casket as a desk, it was with the understanding that you would behave.
The Lady of the Lake hasn't quite adjusted yet to her new role in HR.
I do wish we could chat longer
Leroy, Not Yet! Wait for the signal.
I'm going to ask you one last time if you want to submit that expense report.
It's my new Terrible Swift Sword app.
Enough with the drama, Johnson - your still not getting that promotion.
Am I making my point clearly now?
By the way, Perkins, I’ve been promoted to king.
when I said take a wild stab in the dark Pettigrew, this is not quite what I had in mind
This is not the round table.
I don't appreciate the sabre rattling.
Let's skip the formalities for the most revealing portion of the interview.
You'd be taking Arthur's position, but recently he's really been trying to prove his worth.
I knew this granite desk had a history.
Here is my point!
Send him up right up through the door, Janet, the door.
If executed properly , I feel backstabbing to be an art.
These startups are taking the idea of disrupting our business model too literally.
This is a breakthrough.
Your time's up.
It’ll hang over your head if you’re hired.
Handle first, Jensen! Handle first!
This is NOT what we meant when we were discussing disruptive ideas!
they're rehearsing henry VIII downstairs...
Take it up with Human Resources!
I said, no invasions until noon!
Great Caesar's ghost!
I guess Anger Management hasn't kicked in yet.
Damn it Clark, I understand that the company is in downsizing mode. I just don't think we thoroughly considered all of the implications of subleasing the ground floor to Medieval Times.
I told you to keep our aggressive tactics under cover, you idiot!
Do I make my point?
Holy S-word!
That's it: I'm calling HR.
Are you willing to fight for your job!
Your account is overdrawn, Howard. New bank policy requires us to draw blood.
Ms. Hargrove, just tell him I'm not available!!
Some say our hiring process is old-fashioned.
Your business credentials are fine; how are you at swordplay?
Mr. Cleese, we are NOT going to finance the remake of Holy Grail, so please quit this nonsense.
There it is again...that stabbing sensation in my desk.
Oh, not again -- she keeps telling me I'm going to be the once-and-future CFO!
My wife wants to audition new and exciting mohels for our son's bris next week.
Sorry! I forgot about this knight class I'm taking.
Get it through your head, Griswold…the board unanimously rejected your white knight takeover bid!
Do I have to be President to get an Intern who will sit quietly under my desk!!!
Hang on a sec, that's the ol' battle axe calling.
Mr. Peterson, I must admit your resume makes an aggressive case.
Haven't you heard of e-mail?
Let's negotiate.
Arthur! This time you've gone too far.
I told you Donald, let the lawyer finish, then close the deal.
I said to 'sort' the papers on my desk!
Dammit! Not again!
Let me get straight to the point...
Grab your stock options and run, the corporate raiders are here!
Sir, I understand, no author likes to be rejected.
Yikes, compliance is really cracking down again!
This is Sparta Industries!
I'm mad enough to use the s-word!
My desk thinks it's a round table.
There's a right time and a wrong time to deliver performance evaluations.
Damn it, Damocles. I told you I would let you out after my meeting!
I TOLD my secretary that I was NOT to be disturbed!
We’ve had some cuts this quarter.
NO! I don't think you're getting my point!
These recruiters get more aggressive by the day.
Now I get your thrust.
You heard wrong. This is Art King.
In this job, you'll learn to expect the unexpected.
At least it keeps me from napping on my desk.
Our dress code is tie and suit of armor.
I would like to negotiate a better severance package.
The cleaners changed to a product that kills germs a bit more aggressively!
As they say, let's cut the BS.
She keeps trying to break thru my glass desktop.
I SAID on the count of
The lake is two blocks down!!
I asked for a letter opener not a bayonet.
Now that's how you get my attention!
Dammit, Bob, the Halloween office party ended days ago!
I preferred Take your Daughter to Work Day.
Holy shiv!
Now, don't be alarmed. Our head of marketing cuts everyone off.
“Monica, get our sales rep from Trojan Office Supplies on the line please!”
Don't saber rattle with me, Billingsworth!
You’re hired, as Regional Associate Manager, and King of England!
I'm Arthur King!
We're very competitive here.
Ok, I get the point
This, is not, Sparta!
Sorry, you missed again.
You're hired, as Regional Associate Manager, and King of England!
Sorry for the jolt, MacAfee. Our little IT in shining armor was tasked to eliminate all desktops today.
No, I'll get right to the point.
When I said let's cut to the heart of the matter, I wasn't being literal!
Ms. Gordian, send in my knot solver, now!
I'm telling you for the last time: 'This meeting is over!'
And that was the last time Jimmy applied for a job on Craigslist.
Damn it, Charlemagne, you're late again!
Not now!
This is the problem with Greek furniture!
Luke, calm yourself! I am still your father. As I was saying...the house goes to Leia...
Does it look like I need insurance to protect my family?
The HR department is having annual reviews this week downstairs.
Never bring a sword to a proxy fight!
Enough with the 'Excelsior!' already!
Whoa! Don't be alarmed. It's a blind thrust with a dull blade that is also essentially pointless.
Not yet, Gilmore. Not yet.
We are prepared to fight to keep your business.
The CEO is into Cosplay.
Now will you get out of my office?
Security!
Hey! down there. You're supposed to hang it by a thread.
What do you mean by 'the iPad is mightier than the sword'?
I'll cut to the chase, we've been having real problems with the chase cutting to us.
If anyone is going to be called 'Sir' around here it's going to be me.
No, no, no, this is Craig. Arthur is my
Valyrian steel, and you still missed!
Okay, okay, you'll get the raise.
This is why I don’t keep pictures on my desk.
I said “By the Power of Attorney,” not “By the Power of Grayskull,” dammit.
I'd better let him out.
Wow! The Demo is working!
Sorry. I've got to be somewhere at
Good Lord! Somebody's let our top-secret plan to cut the work force out of the bag.
I'm an offense attorney, dammit. There's a difference.
By the way, Perkins, I've been promoted to king.
'...Miss Jones get the office supply rep. over here right now to disarm that new desk feature he sold us...'
You are missing it by a foot, you fool!
This really is a killer deal.
Stop trying to kill the deal!
This isn't the round table!
Sorry to have frightened you. I told my boss Mr. Damocles that I wasn't interested in his offer.
I see your point... but your still not getting a raise.
Maybe we should consider employee incentives after all
This is the problem with trump real estate!
For the last time, your idea just doesn't cut it!
The sword of righteousness thinks you interview very badly.
Miss Jenkins, please bring in hot oil for the usurper.
Jack, I don't think this is the best way to close the deal.
Siri! I said, 'Time for swag, not time to dag!'
My office is not the glass ceiling!
You are missing the point!
How's this for sales resistance?
Sorry you have to see the caliber of my ex's revenge.
I said, 'send in the report on labor,' NOT 'run you hand thru my desk with a sabre!'
May I borrow your pen?
We’ll need a bigger envelope.
Damned corporate raider! Lying in wait all these years!
I said Coffee!
That pen is not mightier than a sword until it turns into one!
That's not what I meant when I said 'rescue me!'
There IS a Lady in the Desk.
I told you my past was deadly
Oh don't mind Brünnhilde , she thinks she has the lead in Götterdämmerung
This week's workload is really fighting back...
What good is a 'Help' desk without a 'Danger' desk?
We asked for the letter opener, Miss Wilson, not the stone opener!
No under-the-table duels.
Mrs. Fielding, I thought I told you to hold my calls, and to ward off all of my arch nemeses for this important meeting.
Enuf already!! How about $
Our products are legendary.
How are you at ghostbusting?
The time is nigh and thou shalt not reschedule!
Being on the cutting is paramount to us.
Cut the crap!
Why don't you get my point?
Mother! I'm not coming home!
Back to your basement office, accounting dog from hell!
My desk is vintage Ikea
Don't joust sit there, do something!
I told you we needed to trim the fat around here!
Oh these gag gifts from my staff are killing me!
No, I said Skype!
For the LAST time, your charge has been DENIED!
Again with those damn kids fencing downstairs.
The sales rep said I would love the 'swashbuckler' model. Last thing I buy something sight-unseen.
Five days, five desks!
I said I need to see the Board!
No I won't forget, two pounds of Swordfish.
I told you! Wait for the letter!
Brutus? I thought you were an honourable man!
You're hired Johnson, and may the Holy Sword of Gabrielle strike me down if you're not the best Orangutan-Salesman this company has ever seen!
Junior, I told you it's not time for you to take over yet!
Pens are too mighty for me.
Curses! Foiled again by Justice!
I open a lot of letters.
Where's that darn pen when I need it?
Geez! That's one hell of an erection.
Excalibur, I presime!
Didn’t know about the barbarians under the desk.
Please, Dr. Carson, be patient.
And what, exactly, makes you feel that my remarks are overly pointed?!
It's 'Security' experimenting with holograms again!
You, under the desk... I asked you to fix the ejector seat!
Where are you when I need you?
Stop poking into my business!
I told you to kneel, not sit down!
Meet your sales quota, or else...
Gesundheit!
Wait for your cue! We haven't shaken hands yet?
No role-playing when I'm in a meeting!
Go Go Gadget letter opener!
we really did slice through this meeting.
That's just our prompt that another merger has occurred, we've streamlined the process
I said I need the sword of management not sword of Damocles!
Yikes! Is that a late medieval
that damn cat is getting too aggressive
I do wish we could chat longer.
I told you, nothing can stop Carl Icahn
Dammit, Jean; this isn't the Sword of Damocles!
Missed my belt. HA!
You're terminated!
I'm sorry ma'am, your boy Arthur was a round table man in a square desk office
Tell him you want that raise.
Thor! Freya isn't in this millennium!
You missed it, you fool!
Stop the intrusions! I told them it's too soon for a 'Game of Thrones' spin-off.
It seems my bon mot speaks for itself, eh Mr Saperstein?
The desk with a built-in letter opener can cause problems.
WHAT THE F**K?!?!
Mr. Trump is firing by proxy now. You may take the sword.
Damn you, Mammoth Letter Opener Co. on
'Just King Arthur, won't be a big deal', the rental manager told me.
No! The other left!
Arthur! Two kicks!...Not one...two!
Don't even think of putting it all out on the table!
Prepare my horse and armor!
Bob what did you do now
The sword of truth is saying your words are misleading and you are not telling us the truth. Congratulations! You are a perfect candidate to run our next campaign.
How can’t he be the one. He went to state school.
Ok, ok, the pen is not mightier! My kid's in ROTC.
Don't make me call Security, Mr. Connery. We aren't going to do another King Arthur again.
I thought I told you to hold my swashbucklers also , while I'm in a meeting?
Why does this crazy stuff always happen to me?
THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE! (supervising assistant to the deputy aide)
Your CEO transition path? Read the fine print!
Damn it! I knew the cleaners moved my desk and chair around!
When I said 'Talk to the hand' I meant THIS hand.
I'm sorry. The apartment is still not available!
What the hell is the CIA spearing-heading now ?
There can be only one!

I won’t be impressed about your resume unless it is more surprising than a sword coming out of my table
Alright! Who took my pen?!
By the power of Grayskull, I am no longer fricking He-Man!
I need something catchy immediately... A game changer that put a knife in everyone else's design.
By the powers of Grayskull...they told me He-Man was removed from my desk!
No, I will never believe in karma.
What's in your wallet?!
Don't panic, it's just a little scary
I am going to have to dig my heels in on this one.
He said he won't give us a discount Mama!
I guess I'm not the sharpest knife.
