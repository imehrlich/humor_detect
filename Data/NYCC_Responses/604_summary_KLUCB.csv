4908,2149,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,604,"Turn a bit further to the right, and hold it."
4536,2149,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,604,What's wrong now? You said you wanted me to make you look younger.
3759,2149,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,604,A switch to my paleo diet would help you shed those extra pounds.
3792,2149,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,604,"If this turns out blurry, that's your fault!"
3803,2149,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,604,And then you promise I'll have my cave back?

3915,2149,6,10,72,88,1.25,0.061012871862545205,604,I'll call it 'The elephant in the room' and see if that flies.
3972,2149,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,604,You want tusks how big?
4106,2149,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,604,Ogg called it primitive. I say it's representational!
4149,2149,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,604,For the last time: the tusks go on when you stop blowing out that fire!

4209,2149,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,604,"Of course you were cuter then, but now you’re beautiful."
4383,2149,2,18,68,88,1.25,0.051745902770176135,604,But you DO have a week chin.
4390,2149,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,604,"I said give me more mammoth, not mastodon."
4403,2149,2,18,68,88,1.25,0.051745902770176135,604,"Alright, but you're dating yourself. Tusks have been done and done."
4414,2149,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,604,I am done with you. Go find some guys with spears now.
4790,2149,2,18,68,88,1.25,0.051745902770176135,604,"Normally, I try to avoid cliches."
6112,2149,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,604,"For the last time, I am NOT drawing that to scale."
7509,2149,6,10,72,88,1.25,0.061012871862545205,604,You look less woolly in person.
6278,2149,5,12,71,88,1.25,0.0588331327829961,604,Some day you will appear on the cover of The New Yorker!

8165,2149,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,604,It's called realism. Get used to it.
7442,2149,6,10,72,88,1.25,0.061012871862545205,604,A little more to the right.
8210,2149,5,12,71,88,1.25,0.0588331327829961,604,Ceci n'est pas un elephant.

8427,2149,1,20,67,88,1.25,0.049156946952051576,604,"Don't worry, everybody knows that size doesn't matter."
8457,2149,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,604,You were supposed to roast the marshmallows!
8519,2149,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,604,"Sorry, Impressionism hasn't been invented yet."
8741,2149,7,8,73,88,1.25,0.0631173791658769,604,It's not supposed to be realistic. I'm a Pre-Impressionist.
7405,2149,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,604,Can you make my tusks look longer?
8058,2149,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,604,You didn't get my good side.
7957,2149,2,18,68,88,1.25,0.051745902770176135,604,"No, I won't make your tusks look longer."

7870,2149,5,12,71,88,1.25,0.0588331327829961,604,Relax. Don't be so self-conscience. Your ears look fine. In a millenia they'll be ten times the size.
7742,2149,2,18,68,88,1.25,0.051745902770176135,604,"Hold still, no one has tried this before."
7722,2149,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,604,"Hey, shutup, its prehistoric, not postmodern! Everybody's a critic! Geesh!"

7666,2149,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,604,I'm gonna make you a unicorn. I'm not good at drawing horns.
7555,2149,5,12,71,88,1.25,0.0588331327829961,604,"No, darling. It’s all wrong. Rethink it. Less tusk. More trunk. And lose the gum."
7450,2149,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,604,"Yes it's small, but that will make your tusks look bigger."
7476,2149,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,604,I can give you a full head of hair and make your tusks look HUGE if you’ll help move some lumber later...
8056,2149,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,604,Don't you start with your trumpeting. It's a new trend called minimalism.
8103,2149,2,18,68,88,1.25,0.051745902770176135,604,"I know you’re upset about climate change. But come on, It’s almost done. Trunk up!"
3408,2149,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,604,"If I make you look any thinner, you won't be an elephant anymore."
8072,2149,2,18,68,88,1.25,0.051745902770176135,604,Because it’s how I see you—that’s why. Now hold still.
6295,2149,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,604,Don't worry. The zebra will be smaller.
6302,2149,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,604,It is your good side. No one will ever see it anyway.

6713,2149,2,18,68,88,1.25,0.051745902770176135,604,Move again and you’re extinct.
6777,2149,5,12,71,88,1.25,0.0588331327829961,604,So you made the fire. Big deal. This will be in the March 5th issue of The New Yorker!

6822,2149,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,604,I know there’s more to you than this but do you really think that 20000 years from now they’re gonna notice that I didn’t actually capture your true essence?
6830,2149,5,12,71,88,1.25,0.0588331327829961,604,"im going to refer to this as art, after you,Art. so stay still, and you will be famous."
6871,2149,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,604,"Yes, it's you. That's how you look. Go away."

7185,2149,2,18,68,88,1.25,0.051745902770176135,604,I think it's flattering.
7202,2149,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,604,I decided to make you look younger.
7221,2149,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,604,I need them for the piano!

1159,2149,5,12,71,88,1.25,0.0588331327829961,604,OK ... I will make your trunk longer.
1242,2149,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,604,So the tusks are too short. It's art. Get over it.
1245,2149,2,18,68,88,1.25,0.051745902770176135,604,It’s the *idea* of you I’m after!
1292,2149,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,604,My rendering of the elephant in the room. Pretty good considering I don't see you...
1326,2149,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,604,"Any slower, and I'll evolve."
3332,2149,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,604,I know it's the bronze age but I still dabble in the Paleolithic style.
1524,2149,1,20,67,88,1.25,0.049156946952051576,604,It's an homage.
1552,2149,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,604,You'll survive longer if they think you have no tusk.
1565,2149,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,604,This would be a lot cuter if you wore that adorable sweater I knitted for you.
1575,2149,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,604,"Not so, if I wanted all the credit I'd draw a picture of the hot sticks I made."

130,2149,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,604,I should have gone with the bowl of fruit.
182,2149,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,604,"I'm not going for realism, ok?"
186,2149,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,604,How do you spell your last name?
347,2149,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,604,"It's called artistic interpretation, not fake news."
456,2149,5,12,71,88,1.25,0.0588331327829961,604,Move again and no peanuts!

584,2149,2,18,68,88,1.25,0.051745902770176135,604,Quit bellowing --it's either draw you or eat you.
585,2149,5,12,71,88,1.25,0.0588331327829961,604,Hold still--I won't be able to get this when you're extinct.
666,2149,2,18,68,88,1.25,0.051745902770176135,604,It's not like leaving off the tusks makes you any thinner.
683,2149,6,10,72,88,1.25,0.061012871862545205,604,This is why I can't play Pictionary with you... a peanut... really?!?
708,2149,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,604,Your party's policies seem backward to me.
763,2149,4,14,70,88,1.25,0.056569466085583144,604,"""I'm calling it 'Woolly Mammoth'. 'Mastodon' doesn't capture your 'joie de vivre'""."
