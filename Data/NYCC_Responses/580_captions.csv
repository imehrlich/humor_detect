When he starts acting like a king, I'll start acting like a guard.
I'm swinging in the reign.
I kind of like it when he's away on the Crusades.
Technically, I'm guarding two posts.
No, I will not push you again.
Wake me when things are great again.
How he ever produced heirs in this thing, I don't know.
It's a gift from King Hammacher of Schlemmer.
I'm just swinging in the reign.
Don't worry. He's never here. He thinks the palace is a dump.
Wait! Did he tell me to take the hammock or the hemlock?
I've been suspended.
He said one knight stand, didn’t he?
Nighty knight.
Dude, it's a hundred years war.
I'm telling you, 'standing guard' is just an expression.
One trip to Spain and you're all about the siesta.
That was one helluva' party. Where'd we leave the King?
Just tell me if you hear the drawbridge.
I was sentenced to hang.
I shall not be swayed!
Me? I'm the Court Rester.
It's fine, he'll be watching Fox for at least the next hour.
Just swing in' in the reign!
Stop worrying. He doesn't care about hard work. He just expects loyalty.
This time rock me with the blunt end.
That's not what the king meant when he asked you to work the swing shift.
It's a nice perk, I agree...but I'd prefer health insurance.
No, all he said was "no sitting on my throne while I'm gone"
I've got the knight shift.
It's nice, but I'd rather we got dental.
You may as well make yourself comfortable. He went to try and make peace with the French.
It's not a huge deal. You just get a letter from the court doctor about bad knees.
It's not my fault you only have one pillar.
Do you think I'm too easily swayed?
Going union was the best decision we ever made.
The Airbnb listing did say it was "fit for a king."
Hmmm, you know, "Game of Hammocks", just doesn't have the same ring.
It's ok they always blow the trumpets before he comes in.
And now is the summer of my content.
Another spat with the queen my liege?
He said, and I'm quoting here, "Hang around until I get back.
Our kingdom isn't even relevant until Season 5.
Sir, the queen would like to know when will you be returning to your big boy seat?
I suppose this will do, but what I ordered was ham hocks.
Wake me at IV XLV!
Wake me if he tweets.
...and when I come out after 2 weeks I'll be a monarch!
So this is how it feels to be the King of Swing.
Seriously, all you need is a letter from your doctor.
Because I am a royal brother-in-law and you're not.
I've been suspended.
No hurry. He tweets for a couple of hours every morning.
I still prefer the Ottoman.
'I'm employee of the month'
This sure is better than being the guillotine tester.
It looked better on Airbnb...
Can we get this in king size?
Tell them the usual - record growth, respect abroad, prosperity for all, and covfefe.
Good night, good knight.
You should join our union.
I'm glamping.
Why not? He's golfing in Florida 'til Tuesday.
Wish I had a book... And knew how to read.
Does her majesty have another migraine, Sire?
Gotta love casual Fridays.
Well, he DID say that if I didn't shape up, my ass would be in a sling...
The King said I'd be hanged. This was a happy surprise.
I'm just a throne's stow away
The rein of the Hammocks was brief but comfortable.
Be a dear and fetch me a Bloody Mary.
Could you hand me that small pillow on the chair?
Wake me up for the impeachment.
It's hemorrhoids, ok! You happy now?
I take it you're not in the union.
I'm also his son-in-law.
They'll call me Atilla the Hung.
Relax. The last crusade lasted eight years.
What's the worst she could do?
It's a bi-poler thing.
I call it a "sling bunk." Can't wait to show King Hammock my invention!
Got any good knight stories?
You're the new guy, right?
I'm swinging in the reign.
I've checked and nowhere in the job description did it say STANDING guard.
I'm holding sway.
I thought about a crusade, but I'm going with a staycation this year.
I still say it beats anything from the Ottoman Empire.
Bring me the wench with good balance!
The King said it was either a beheading or a hanging. For me the choice was easy.
Who's that coming: the king or the jester? They sound so alike these days.
I just got tenure.
Ever get that nagging feeling you might have left the drawbridge down?
I hate to ask, but can you give me a little push?
y-y-y-Your Majesty's return is unexpected !!
We agreed, when we pillage, it's my turn. When we plunder it is your turn.
We should have taken over a castle with a backyard.
I prefer to think of it as 'working smarter, not harder'.
Sure beats the rack.
Great, NOW I have to go to the bathroom.
This is even better than the Ottoman Empire!
Ignoring my post? I'm literally tied to it.
Wake me when it's the Enlightenment.
With respect, Sire, I don't feel 'Game of Hammocks' has quite the resonance you're seeking.
Stand there if you like but he's not going to be back before September.
Let's face it Lance...We have very different guard styles...that's all.
I told you we should have upgraded to the queen.
That was the best knight's sleep I've had in ages.
So he put my ass in a sling.
And so it is, my Kingdom is in recline.
Throne don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing
He Left__Said He Wanted to Make the 'Dark Ages' Great Again
It's not my fault you don't have two columns.
Chill out, dude. He went to New Jersey to golf again.
It feels good to let my guard down.
I'm sorry sire. When I booked it they said it was a place to relax among pillars of the community.
Hammock, my friend... What should I call this contraption?
Your majesty, should I presume you are in the dog castle again with the queen?
Tell them I went down swinging.
You're right. Not much lumbar support, but it's heaven on my hemorrhoids.
Relax. It's season 7. At this point, if His Grace is gone for more than 10 minutes, I'm assuming he's dead.
C'mon, give me a push.
Tell the Princess she'll never feel the pea in this thing.
I dreamt I was the inside of a banana.
Approach the hammock just doesn't have the right ring to it.
What's the worst that could happen?
Wake me up if you hear the bastard coming.
Can you push me again?
When I'm king, I'm getting a whole bunch of these.
Didn't anyone tell you he was in Mar-a-Lago?
I'm having an unguarded moment.
All right, Sir Lounge-a-lot. Break time's over.
Are you sure it said 'King-sized' on the box?
The description on Airbnb said it would be two hammocks.
Wake me when you hear the flush.
I'm supposed to protect him against his worst enemy, so wake me if he starts to tweet.
He's SO paranoid. I have to test everything.
I just can't sleep standing up anymore.
With barbarians at the gate I'm opting for a staycation.
Any chance you could find a curtain for that window?
I never thought the King would agree to our union's demands
What makes you think I couldn't be the next King of Swing?
Between pillar and post ain't all that bad.
I'm not worried; his absolute minimum shit was 83 minutes.
The homeowners' association wouldn't let me put it outside.
Everyone who sits in that chair is killed. I found a workaround.
I'm bipolar.
So who's laughing at the newest Employee of the Month now?
"The Queen was in one of her moods again".
If this is his idea of hanging, drawing and quartering should be a laugh.
There are many sides to the 'throne v. hammock' debate. Many sides
No, I'm not enjoying my staycation.
Whichever King invented the the throne to sit on all day had clearly never lounged in a hammock.
If anyone asks, you're me.
I never made fun of your yoga ball.
So I figured: why pay rent and spend an hour each way commuting?
Casual Fridays.
"I said 'hemlock'".
No, I don't want to talk about Game of Thrones.
I like it. Order one in queen for the wife.
This new column is a game changer!
Talk to Linda in H.R. She's got the forms.
Apparently I snore.
You can stand there if you want but he's not coming back till thursday
Wake me if what's his name comes back.
What? He said make yourself at home...
How long have you been standing there?
Dude, it really ties the room together.
It's a WORKING nap!
Think about it. Is someone really going to steal the throne?
I am not really a Knight person.
I mean why not? The king's always out playing golf
It's not my fault if your side has only one column.
Just a quick absolute power nap.
What? She didn't say we had to "stand" guard.
Wake me when the enemies reach the gate... or the King is on the 18th hole, whichever comes first.
This is why you join the union.
Marketing promised a four poster with overhead mirror, then it went to Accounting
I distinctly asked for ham hocks!
Might as well chill. I hear the crusade is gonna take a while.
What surprised ? - I like to swing both ways.
Which way do you swing?
If you joined the union, they'd look after you too.
This contraption promises a good knight’s sleep.
I'm just saying, you don't need two guards to guard an empty chair.
At least they can't call me a sleepless Knight.
Damn it! I forgot to go to the bathroom.
I can't get into any worse trouble. I've already got my butt in a sling.
I slept my way to this cushy job, I see no reason to stop now.
You should ask for another pillar.
You really ought to join the union.
The Hammock Empire, the Hammock Empire, it's just embarrassing, how about the Ottoman Empire?
I'm th court rester.
Apologize, and The Queen will allow you back in chambers.
I told you to join the union.
C'mon, just one push.
This is his robe. That's why he has no clothes.
If His Majesty can go on a working vacation, so can I.
Look, we flipped a coin and I got the side with two pillars so get over it, already!
Then they shouldn't have put them so close together.
Beats hell out of that mattress with the hidden pea!
The seat of power was surprisingly uncomfortable.
'Get up - it's VIII o'clock.'
And then I was just like, "What am I even guarding anymore?"
I call it an ergonomic workstation.
Your'e, indeed, a well-hung knight, Sir Hammock.
The free shipping got me.
I said "hassock," you idiot!
If you don't tell the King, I won't tell him you're wearing the Queen's Panties.
The Siege of Margaritaville hath reaped but meager plunder.
I forget. Am I lying down or laying down on the job?
He did say "at ease!"
You should have joined the Union.
Golfing again in Jersey. Wake me up Monday.
The queen is my sister, that's why!
Someone's been putting peas under all the mattresses.
It's called "glamping."
It's called a staycation.
It's a working vacation. I invented it.
Casual Fridays.
I'm guarding the hammock, you guard the rest.
A bed. A bed. My kingdom for a bed.
Has it been 4 years yet?
I think I'll call it la-z-roi
Haven't you heard? We're union now.
Of course my fortune's outrageous. You got the sling and I got the arrow.
Don't tell King Hammock about it, he'll take all the credit.
Well, I'm not just going to stand there while he's off golfing again!
I found this place on Heirbnb.com
They do it at Google!
Not my fault you only have one column.
This helps prevent throne rash.
Relax, he’s on the other throne.
Can't you see? I've been suspended.
I want the King to see that I'm well hung.
Send in the queen, I feel like some pillar talk.
? Well it don't mean a thing, if the kings' got no swing,... do whop, do whop, do whop, do whop, do whop. ?
It's my turn; you had it during the last siege.
No problem. He'll be on the golf course all weekend.
No, I don't feel calm and secure... And I don't want to talk about my mother!
Just swing in' in the reign!
Don't give me that look... You know how long he takes on his other throne.
Tell the people I'm power napping.
Play your cards right and one day you too could be the kings hammock tester.
I'm just swinging in the reign.
I swear, if you close your eyes it's like you're in the Bahamas.
I'm tired of bending the knee. Now I'm resting the tush.
I’m not really in a meeting, that’s just what you tell people.
I asked for a ham hock, you imbecile.
I was terrified when he first said hang him
I'm Union, you're not. Deal with it.
I'd get up and switch with you, but you're doing such a great job!
“To die, to sleep - To sleep, perchance to dream - ay, there's the rub, For in this sleep of death what dreams may come...” ? William Shakespeare, Hammock (first draft)
Oh, hell, he won't be back from Mar-a-Lago for weeks.
I'll take the swing shift.
I’m calling it a "power nap."
This isn't exactly what I meant by 'King of Swing.'
Go ahead, sit on the throne! You'll see why I'm in the hammock.
It's a perk to attract top talent. There's a sushi bar in the dungeon now, too.
I ordered a sling.
Befriend the royal architect, get an extra column on your side--simple as that.
Just as I suspected, the King swings both ways!
They were out of King-sized
Wake me when the Dark Ages are over.
No . . . I think Claudius said 'Bring unto me Hamlet'.
Wenches dig it.
I'm working from home today.
Our contract only says, “be at his side”.
Wake me when the whores arrive.
I call it my prone throne
Relax brother. During the last Crusade he was gone for three years.
I'm bunking here while the king is sleeping with my wife.
It's just so much better for my hemorrhoids.
Oh come on Elwood, she won't be back for hours. Call me 'Your Highness' and peel me a grape.
I'm just not sure I like working the swing shift.
He's off searching for his moral compass.
I plundered it from the flea market.
Just one push, Max, and straighten the rug before the King comes back!
Would it kill you to hum a lullaby?
The Queen snores.
It comes when you upgrade to a second pillar.
Hey, YOU try sitting for hours on that thing with a bad back!
"Hark" once if you see the king and twice if I start snoring.
Morning Hun...
Well, it's not my fault you don't have another pillar on your side.
You go on. I'd rather remember him with his head.
I dunno why they say "Uneasy lies the head of state" -- this thing is very comfy!
Yes, a perfect opportunity for a good knight's sleep.
Well, I don't intend to wait eight centuries for memory foam.
We changed repeal and replace with rest and relax.
Yes, Geoffrey. My argument for a load-bearing pillar did have selfish designs.
Well then whats the point of the extra column??
Yes, thank you, Harold, a cup of Sleepytime tea WOULD be nice.
HR says I've accrued too many vacation days.
I can do this job in my sleep.
"You go ahead and start the pillaging and carnage without me, I think I'm coming down with a plague or something"!
They said I could either bow the knee or hang.
They allow it at Google.
Why stand when you can sit and why sit when you can lie down?
I wîsh I had two pillars....
I see you've been on Amazon again.
I swear we're safe. He can't play 18 holes on a public course in under six hours.
The King said hang around and guard the castle and by god that is what I intend to do!
I invented it for a good knight's sleep.
Let me know if the cameras get switched back on.
Last I heard he's in Palm Beach, he thinks this castle is a dump
Too bad you didn't join the union.
I just couldn't handle the commute anymore.
Why else would they place two pillars this close together
I suppose if I had another pillar, I'd do the same.
Look l'm the Monarch rising from his cocoon!
The king ordered you to bring him a ham hock, you fool!
We plundered this?
Thrones, impressive but no lumbar support.
Budget cuts affect everybody.
"My Kingdom for some hemmoroidal cream"!
Because there's only one pillar on your side, that's why!
Relax. He's out in Bedminster for the whole weekend.
When the king gets home, your butt's in a sling.
It wasn't until after we bought the throne that we realized there was no room left in the budget for a bed.
Did you hear "off to his bed" or "off with his head?"
Serf's up, dude!
"Are you sure this is a King size"?
Relax. He's at the royal golf course again.
I serve at the king's leisure.
Wake me when he is impeached.
I'm the King, I can't go camping.
Summon the royal psychoanalyst
Don't worry. I superglued that sword into the stone.
Things, including break time, are so much better since we unionized.
What? Did you think every royal caterpillar emerges as a butterfly!
When they said it was a 24 hour job, l didn't realize they meant in a row.
He's wrong. The throne is much more comfortable.
It's called a staycation.
The throne comes with too much responsibility.
It was only $3.99 on Amazon, including delivery!
I won't stand on ceremony.
I'm calling this the alt-throne!
I'm sorry! It's not my fault that your side doesn't have two pillars.
Well, I say there IS a dragon under my bed.
Because his highness said there is nothing better than a good knight's rest.
It's called an "ergonomic workspace."
No, I'm sleeping NEAR the job...
It's still no use, but try reading me the Magna Carta again.
I'm tired of hearing you tell everyone who comes by that I'm on the throne.
I am standing guard. Don't be so literal.
You stand guard and I'll relax guard.
Sometimes I just need to remember why it is good to be the king.
It's in our union contract.
wake me if you hear trumpets
What time do the Crusades begin?
So I thought, "As long as I'm between posts, why not relax?"
When the king's away, the guards will sway.
It was a lateral move.
Well, if you must ask, the queen snores.
It's safe to come out now, Your Majesty--the spider's dead
It's perfect for my power nap.
Donald Trump is a jackass.
Might as well. King Donald is going to fire us anyway.
So the Ottomans can't reach me.
Millennials find sovereign rulers in high-back thrones less accessible.
Yes, but I know his dirty little secret.
I don't think that is what the King meant by stringing you up.
My kingdom for a piña colada!
He won't be in for another hour, He was up all night Tweeting.
I'll probably hang for this
I used up all my vacation days
Well, how do you define "at ease..."?
You should have joined the Union.
I was told to man my posts.
Relax. He's in the bathroom on Twitter.
I'd prefer one with a memory foam mattress.
It's part of the corporate stress reduction program.
If he comes back, we'll say it's a new catapult that we're testing.
Just don't stand there, give me a push!
Because "The Game of Thrones" was already taken. That's why.
So, I see that you've been on Amazon again.
I'm not to leave my post!
This is not a vacation - meetings and calls!.....Working Hard.
I don't think that what the king meant when he said you'll hang for it.
Cry hammock! And let sleep the dogs of war.
I'm practicing for our siege at Mar-e-Lago
We also set up a slackline in the dungeon.
It's really difficult to find pillars close enough together around here.
You're knight and I'm knight knight.
If those are the Saxons knocking, I'm not here.
Relax, it's casual Friday.
This is my idea of going from pillar to post.
I get up to use the throne at night.
If anyone calls, tell them I'm working remotely.
Three weeks later, Gary still wouldn't shut up about his vacation to the Bahamas.
Yes, I'm well-hung.
This way I don't have to wear pants.
It still doesn't feel like a tropical getaway.
It's why I chose the side with two pillars.
That throne just kills my back.
I'm exploring new master-servant paradigms.
C'mon, just a little push to get me going!
I'm out of sick days, OK?
Remember, the signal is, "The royal hammock tester is almost through, Your Majesty."
Sometimes, it is easy being king.
You mind tossing me that pillow?
What's your sleep number?
I needed a vacation.
I do my best autocratic thinking here.
Wake up call for Sir Lounge-A-Lot!
He went to see Cersei. It's going to be awhile.
Wake me when its the Reformation
I love our 'alert guard, relaxed guard' dynamic.
What’s the matter--haven’t you ever had hemorrhoids?
Judge me all you want - I'm the one who isn't doing the morning commute.
Are the Dark Ages over?
If that's his highness's cape, you're one dead guard.
Don't worry...it's just until he returns from his "it's not a vacation."
It's okay, I have a note from my apothecary.
Dude! You chose the side with one column, so don't fucken blame me.
You just don't know what it's like to be a Millennial in 1017.
The Crown did promise a safe and comfortable workplace environment
They call it a hammock. I call it work/life balance
If you know what's good for you, you'll put that tapestry back on the wall!
We changed repeal and replace with rest and relax.
If anyone asks, I'm planning an invasion while strengthening my core.
Hey. Might as well. Next week I have to be the wine taster.
I call it 'swing shift'.
I'm on swing shift.
'Don't let my subjects know that I swing both ways'
It's my safe place.
She would've laughed if the court jester had said it.
I'm working the knight-shift, again.
Do you ever feel like you're not living up to your full potential?
Yeah, well right now this hammock is the greater part of valor.
Has it been four years yet?
I probably should put some pants on
Wake me up after the Dark Ages.
I said, "Cry HAVOC," you idiot.
I'm working the knight shift.
All you need now is a copy of The Old Yorker.
Wake me when he's back from Mar-a-Lago.
I'm not worried, these crusades go on forever - the King won't be back for months.
Uneasy lies the throne.
Wake me up when this monarchy ends.
He's not coming back. I saw it on Twitter.
Hold my calls.
I'm the hangman.
You expect me to sleep on the job standing up?
While the king's away, the knights will sway.
My guess is you're new on the night shift?
The hard part is installing the second pillar
You're new here, aren't you.
Toss me that pillow.
Can you see if he's got any cigars behind the throne there?
Give us a push, love.
If the king comes in, be sure to tell my wife I loved her.
What is REI?
What? My kids bought it for me for Father's Day.
Our fate swings in the balance.
Is the queen smiling this morning?
Listen, technically, the job description said, "good knight"...
Look , it was either pay my health care premium or pay my rent.
I'm lazy? He hasn't conquered anyone in decades.
Well, if you change your mind, there's plenty of room for two.
You're making hammockery of the throne.
Just jingle your chainmail a little if you hear him coming back.
Retirement benefits kick in with abdication.
How about a push?
I'm on vacation.
This place is a dump. I can't believe Castle Advisor gave it 4.7 stars.
It was left over from last year's alt history play, Henry VIII Conquers the South Pacific
Wake me up when it's your turn.
I favor hanging.
We do things a little differently on swing shift.
I said to order ham hocks!
I really don't know what to call it, Sir Hammock, but it's pretty comfortable.
No...Court Rester. Better hours and I never run out of material.
We strike...mañana.
Don't just stand there, give me a little push.
It don't please the king if you don't leave that swing. Do wop, do wop, do wop, do wop, do.
I asked for ham-hocks, not hammocks.
Que l'histoire sache, Napoléon n'a pas abdiqué. Il a été suspendu!
Could you sing me the lullaby about the barbarians and the visigoths?
Relax he's at Mar-a-lago.
Don't just stand there, start pushing!
He owes me tons of overtime.
Without these power naps, I don't know how I'd ever be able to work the knight shift.
If the King's away, they hammock will sway.
Because I'm high strung.
You can test the food. I'll test the hammock.
I just thought, if we're going to be a banana republic...
This sure beats crusading.
If Millenials stood guard.
I just had a horrible dream. What if people only like me because I am king?
Wait, the king said we had to be prepared to LIE for him?
The first Staycation.
I really miss the crusades and all those nights outside under the moon and the stars.
Please turn your head. I'm gonna try to get out of this thing.
They also serve who only lie and wait.
I like it when you sing that song about rowing a boat.
I love weekends.
When the King is away, this guard will sway!
What? I'm a free-lancer.
Don't give me that uneasy lies the head line. Just bring me another pillow.
Look at me...I'm "sir lounge-alot!"
Tell them I'm serfing.
If you post this on social media you are dead meat.
She said 'ham hocks'? Bloody helmets!
Do you even know what 'anachronism' means?
I like a short commute.
It's casual friday.
Well, I'm not the one up for annual review.
Where in the manual does it say I must 'stand' at my post?
Yes, Game of Hammocks because that other name is taken.
Don't just stand there, give me a push!
I'm on swing shift this week.
Frank, be honest. Do I make this hammock sag too much?
Nighty knight.
We need to replace that runner.
I prefer to approach concerns with an attitude of relaxed awareness.
To heir is human, to fuck off supine.
May I recommend a standing desk as a compromise?
Have you ever had one of those days where you just say 'what the heck.'
Why do you think I request guard duty on the side with two pillars?
We are pleasantly surprised, but this is not what we were envisioning when the crowd told you to 'string him up.'
Since you're up, mind handing me that pillow?
While this is quite amusing, tell my attendants I said ham hock.
This castle, what a dump.
He really is the king of swing.
I won't tell anyone the king has died if you won't.
It's a Hammocker Schlemmer original.
I slept my way to the top.
You are SO not getting ‘Employee of the Month’!
Stand-up workstations are overrated.
The throne is hard on my hemorrhoids
It was easier getting in.
Run out and see if the revolution is over.
The Crusades, the Plague - all we can manage this summer is a staycation.
I'm giving this Air Bed and Castle only one star.
Get me one of those pillows off the big gaudy chair, won't you?
Don't leave in case I can't get out of this.
You think this is what he meant when he said, "String him up'?
Wake me up when Game of Thrones comes on
did you remember to lock the drawbridge?
Sing me something soft and tender.
Seriously. This time I really did hear the king's trumpets.
The reason two of us guard the throne is in case one of us falls asleep.
Give me a heads-up when he's on the 18th tee.
Because I'm the one who convinced the Queen that trumpeters should announce her return.
It facilitates a more comfortable and pleasing recumbent posture, ergonomically speaking.
Not doing my job? I urge you to consider both sides.
Didn't you hear the edict about Casual Fridays?
It was either this or a standing desk.
dos cervezas, por favor.
...and make that a gin-and-tonic instead of mead.
L'etat c'est meow.
Does it have to be a round table or can we all fit in the hammock?
I don't care if it's all the rage in Paris; help me out of this bloody thing!
It's 'hanging' very well, thank you.
If I have to go, I'm going out swinging.
I'm assuming this is what she meant by 'you're sleeping on the couch tonight'.
I don't care. I'm not gonna stand here all day guarding an empty chair. Get me another beer.
This summer it's all about looking alert, yet relaxed.
Because I'm cranky if I don't get my nap.
I don't see what the peasants are on about, hanging is quite nice!
Why else would they have put this pillar here?
I was working late last night; so, I just decided to sleep in the office.
Just pretend that everything is normal when he enters.

Cry HAMMOCK and unleash the dogs of war!
It's called a working vacation.
By the time he's done with his seven wives, I'd have caught me forty winks.

What?! It was a gift from Columbus!
I don't want the responsibility that goes with that big chair!
Arthur's cape is missing.
So what? Everyone else is abandoning him.
It's not my fault there's two columns on this side.
I think the ad for hangman referred to a different type of hanging and swinging...
A hammock makes this such a cool fort!
I had a dream about you.
I asked Alexa to reorder the ham hocks!
If I only could get two columns on my side too.
How long you been standing there?

We call it The Staycation.
Must be nice to be his son.
Oh Come on! What are the odds a siege happens by day?
Al, I had the most horrific nightmare. In the distant future, in a land far, far away, where the king's descendants lived, an evil called 45 rose to power and set out to destroy all that was good.
The seat of power is a royal pain in the ass.
TELL TRUMP I'M BUSY...
Well, don't just stand there, push!
I'll be working remotely today.
Good luck convincing the King that your weight is keeping the columns straight.
Are you the one who leaked that I'm abdicating the throne due to hemorrhoids?
Relax, he spends most of his time golfing and then goes back to the tower.
I'm tired of bending the knee. I'm resting the tush.
It's because you only have one column

Hey, check this out...contains eco-friendly memory foam, cooling gel, and organic cotton.
I have a better chance at 'Game of Hammocks.'
Quickly....he's coming and my legs have fallen asleep!
His head might lie uneasy, but mine is very relaxed.
I'm starting to think about myself more.
Do you really think he'll notice?
Relax. He'll be on the golf course for hours.
They're binge-watching Game of Thrones in the barracks, so I'm crashing here.
One day they will say, "And the rest is history".

Wake me when the Dragons get here.
Relax. The King's gone off on one of his crusades.
And I'm not wearing shoes, either.
Captain Hammock; I'm trying to think of a name for my new invention. Any suggestions?
I think someone has been eating crackers in my hammock.
I'm making myself comfortable, Game Of Thrones comes on at 9 o'clock!
Yes, well, as they say, "you don't get what you deserve, you get what you negotiate."
Democracy is just a phase, I'm waiting it out.
What's the problem? He's at his golf club for the weekend!

I think I tweet better over here.
Just hand me the pillow. No one has to know.
He's golfing in New Jersey.

He can't be a king if he ain't got no swing
I need to use the throne.
Can you get me an umbrella drink and make some ocean noises?

This is why you should always guard the side with two pillars.
Is the reign over?
Look, he's only here for proclamations of tax increases and beheadings and I've got bunions.
He doesn't care for Leroy. He prefers Le Roi.
My turn!
It's not as plush as it looks.
The trees in Birnham Wood kept moving.
My therapist tells me I'm bipolar.
He used to have trees, but they were used to launch the rocket to Mesopatamia.

It's the farthest thing from insolence. It's called a staycation.
The spacing between these columns screamed for a hammock.
I’m on the swing shift.
Thrones are so pretentious

Have someone from the dungeon come up to give me a push.
Can't get away from the office.
If he's been away long enough for me to put up this hammock, then he'll be away long enough for me to take a nap.

I've always been a Type B personality.
Don't worry about it. He spends his weekends at Mar Lago.
Royal jealousy won't win a seat in ye majesty's hammock.
Before you take your leave, would you mind giving me a push?
Other start up castles say it boosts productivity in the kingdom.
Only reigning cat? I thought this came with a dog.
It caught me, now what?
What! Don't look at me like that. I swing, you swing, then we'll all swing. There can only be one swinger. Besides I have two pillars on my side and a bad back. Go figure.

"Today's orgy was exhausting. I need to catch 40 winks before leaving to pillage the village".
Is my 10 minutes break over yet?
I'm not worried. He's out playing golf and won't be back for at least a week.
He called me a good man and told me to relax. I think that means he's going to fire me.
I don't think this will alter the fact that my cock is burning like a sonfoabitch.
Well then, should try out the other torture devices.
I'm on a break....

Have you taken care of those thronebugs yet?
Don't get any ideas, I already have a patent pending.
At least my throne is portable.

I picked this up on Amazon, what do you think?
Perchance to dream: ay, of you fetching me a bedpan.
I found where he hides the fiddlers three!
'Tis said he hath relinquished the throne.

My Kingdom for the Winds of Winter.
I got it on sale at R.E.I.G.N..
My kingdom for an effective lullaby.
Beats sitting on the Iron Throne!
I'm just connecting with my inner seafarer.
Hey, mind your own business!
That damn throne hurts my butt.
And a coconut from the manor.
Fall asleep for a minute and see what happens?

The damn throne gives me hemorrhoids.
Sire, we should stow the hammock. Winter is coming.
Nobody ever mentioned an Iron Hammock.
