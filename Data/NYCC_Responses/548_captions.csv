Well, five acres of popcorn back there says you were.
So Major Tom... Do you know how fast you were going?
Sir, I don't make the laws of physics I just enforce them.
I'm going to need you to take one small step out of the vehicle
I don't make the laws of physics, sir. I just enforce them.
Sir, please take one small step out of the vehicle.
Take one small step out of the vehicle, sir.
You call it a glitch in the space-time continuum. I call it a stop sign.
I got you doing light in a sound zone.
If you stay below the speed of sound you'll hear the sirens next time.
First of all, thank you for stopping.
You're the first one to actually stop.
And I suppose they don't have stop signs in the future either.
Sir, I just need you to take one small step out of the vehicle.
I clocked you doing light in a sound zone.
I clocked you at tomorrow.
First, thanks for stopping.
...and I can't stress this enough, do not restart your engine until I've pulled away.
Sir, I usually ask this rhetorically, but do you know how fast you were going?
the farmer with the field of popcorn would like a word with you...
I'm going to have to ask you to take one small step out of your vehicle.
Says here you're a flight risk.
I see that, but you still need a plate on the front.
It's not for speeding. It's for incinerating the guy behind you at the stop sign back there.
I'll be honest, the fine will be astronomical.
Your re-entry light is out.
I know, buddy. Everyone's in a big hurry to get to Canada.
Generally mach anything is grounds for a ticket.
I'm going to have to take you in. You're a flight risk.
A warning this time, but only because you have to live with the fact that I caught you.
I see you're from out of town.
I don't care if it's Mission Control. Texting is texting.
You rolled through a stop sign three states back.
Cool your jets, ace.
You were speeding; you get a ticket. This is not rocket science.
I know WHY you pulled me over, but I'm not sure HOW.
So this is the new Honda Viagra...
Sir, I'm going to need you to eject from the vehicle.
Just leave a little earlier next time..
We respect the sound barrier in this county, son.
Trying to get back to November 8?
Cool your jets, ace.
Sir, your registration is 80 years in the future.
Then how do you explain the sonic boom?
Nice car, sorry about your penis.
Of course I caught up with you. It's a Crown Victoria.
Stop calling me Houston.
Sir, 495 is the highway number, not the speed limit.
I don't care who in Houston you're talking to; you can't be on your phone
Your fine is going to be astronomical.
Round here we obey the sound barrier, son.
I'm going to need you to take one small step for man out of the vehicle, sir.
Don't even think about pressing the eject button.
Trying to fly under the radar?
Sir, do you realize you were going 6,500 in a 50-mile zone?
Zero to sixty in a second was impressive, but it was the next ten seconds where we have a problem, Sir.
You're not from around here are you?
Failure to signal left turn and incinerating my partner.
Look around you, son. This here's a fly-over state.
As you approach the speed of light, time may slow, but ticket fines go up.
I'll overlook the burned out taillights, but I am going to have to cite you for the sonic boom.
Your left blinker is out.
It's a hybrid.
Up there you talk to NASA. Down here you talk to me.
Aren't you kind of embarrassed that I caught you?
OK, fella, cool your jets.
I think you know why I pulled you over. The question is how.
Are you wondering why I pulled you over?' "No, I'm wondering how
Sorry about your penis.
Eject yourself from the vehicle please.
Any idea how I pulled you over?
Since your vehicle will be impounded over the holidays, I'll call Missile-Tow.
Houston, we have a ticket.
First of all, thank you for pulling over.
That's one giant leap for mankind and this small ticket for you.
Why I stopped you? For holding up the flow of traffic.
First off, I appreciate you pulling over.
It's not smoke - this is a vapemobile.
I'm afraid The Force is with me on this one.
Let me guess, your other car is a Prius.
Well, just the one glass of Tang before I left the office.
Please eject from the vehicle sir!
Do you know why I pulled you over, or how?
First, I want to thank you for stopping.
That's not the speed limit sign, that's Highway 218.
You missed that STOP sign in Ohio
Sir, I'm pulling you over because you ran red lights in New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, and Ohio, and Nebraska, and...
C'mon officer, I was going faster than that.
I bet you're wondering how I caught you.
You failed to signal on re-entry.
Bursts of flame don't count as a turn signal
May a little less force be with you next time.
Don't you want to know how I caught up with you?
Let me guess. Your wife's in labor and you live on the moon?
After I write up your ticket, please don't start your engine until I've driven off.
I'm citing you for a broken sound barrier.
What about the guy who passed me?
You been drinking anything besides Tang?
Okay, I'll need your: drivers license; registration; insurance card; pilots license; NASA test certificate; EPA and state pollution waver; UN global warming exception; Jet Propulsion Lab experimental permit and your state weight and length permit.
Can't get to the Canadian border fast enough?
Please allow me to backup before you start your engines.
I have to take you in as a flight risk.
License and constellation, please.
Your license expired light years ago!
I only have one question: why did you stop?
Sir, do you know how fast you were going back there? Because I have no idea.
OK, buddy. Cool your jets.
If you had a rearview mirror you would know that I've been chasing you since Tuesday.
Do you know how fast you were going? Because I don't have a clue.
If I let it slide, will you take me with you?
Are you aware that you were driving in the carpool lane?
And I'm about to boldly send you to where lots of men have gone.
You're not from around here, are you son?
Speeding, failure to yield, improper lane usage, no brake lights, disturbing the peace, 3 stop sign violations, failure to file a flight plan, technically, there’s no ordinance about what you did to that cow, no license plates, no insurance………
I noticed you were texting
I'm gonna need to search the vehicle for illegal aliens
Really? No idea at all?
Cool your jets
You can just cool your jets while I write up this citation.
I need to check the trunk for illegal aliens.
HIT AND RUN? All I did was nudge the bumpers on the cars behind and in front of me to squeeze out of a tight parking place.
Don't start your engines until I leave.
Do you know how fast time was slowing?
Yes, the speed limit does apply to re-entry.
You just ran 500 red lights.
Any idea how loud you were going?
Sir, I'm going to have to search your vehicle for illegal aliens.
You ran a stoplight 2000 miles back.
You want to know how I caught up with you don't you?
I've gotta be honest. I have no idea how fast you were going.
First, thanks for pulling over.
I don't care where you said you'd move if he was elected.
Never thought I'd get to say this, but please step out of the rocket.
Let's just say this ticket is going to pay for my retirement.
Why did I stop you? ... Just to see if I could.
Oh, that 495 sign is the route number?
No, officer. Actually, I'm wondering HOW you pulled me over.
My wife has a Prius so I figure we're carbon neutral
It's a rental.
'Living life in the fast lane' is a metaphor -- not an explanation!
Sir, I'm going to need you to take one small step and the one giant leap out of the car.
Sir, the law of gravity is about the only one you didn't just break...
Slow down. Canada's not going anywhere.
I repeat license and registration, Sir. This is not rocket science.
I'm gonna let you slide on breaking the sound barrier, but I'll hafta write you up for not wearing your seat belt.
You heard me. Open the trunk!
Are we trying to compensate for something here?
Good morning sir, I expect you'd like to know what happened to the boat you were towing!
The reason I pulled you over isn't rocket science.
And you're sure all you've had to drink is Tang?
One of your brake lights is out.
If you had been flying under the radar I wouldn't be standing here, would I?
Sir, I've been chasing you since 1987.
No Sir, the 'M' in MPH does not stand for Mach.
To be honest, I'm surprised you pulled over.
You're not from around here, are you son?
Can't you just get a tiny red convertible like other hapless 50 year olds?
Looks like "The Right Stuff" got off at "The Wrong Exit".
My wife won't let me have a motorcycle.
Actually, it wasn't your speed so much as the sonic boom.
You flew through that stop sign.
My question to you is. Why did you stop?
Thank you for pulling over. It occurred to me after I hit the siren that I didn't really have a Plan B.
Not from around here are you?
Normally I would ask this sarcastically, but were you trying to set a land speed record?
I don't really know how fast you were going, but I'm putting yesterday's date on the ticket.
Sir, driving responsibly isn't rocket science.
Small penis?
You went through three stop signs, a school zone and Mount Rushmore.
You just exceeded your carbon footprint.
Did it work? Are we back on November 7?
Any idea how I pulled you over?
Would it help if I told you it's a hybrid?
You're probably wondering how I caught you?
I wasn't driving, officer, I was landing.
When I had my midlife crisis, I bought roller blades.
Don't you want to know how I caught up with you?
You're the rocket scientist, you tell me.
Is there something wrong, officer?
You still need two or more passengers for the carpool lane, sir.
Yes, you might say I'm profiling.
I'm actually grateful: this meets my quota for the whole year.
WHY I pulled you over? I'm more interested in how.
I'll give you just a warning if you'll let me drive it by my old high school.
Do you realize how fast you were going because I don't?
Eject yourself with your hands up!
You're not from these parts, are you?
You were travelling at the speed of light in a speed of sound zone, sir.
Sir, are you aware that your left turn signal has been on through Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont?
Let's see, 150 dollars times the speed of light...
... speeding, failure to yield, driving while texting, running a stop sign, vaporizing a garbage truck, ...
Sorry Mack, but around here the sound barrier is strictly enforced.
No, you weren't speeding. It's your carbon footprint.
I pulled you over for failing to yield to the state of Ohio
Where on Earth did you learn to drive?
Sir, I pulled you over for a violation of the time-space continuum.
Let the record show that I caught you with a Ford.
Overcompensating a bit, Aren't you?
You were 10 miles over the speed limit. And, by the way, that's pathetic.
You realize that was a rolling stop back there, right?
Cool your jets
You need to practice a little more ground control, Major Tom.
Then out of nowhere, officer, some total asteroid cut me off.
You failed to yield upon re-entry.
Ground control to major dumbass.
Compensating for something, are we?
Given everything else, I’m gonna overlook the busted taillight.
Just think of this as one giant leap for a man fined.
Yeah, you can't always rely on Google maps.
Oh yeah? Well around here, we like the sound barrier just the way it's always been
January 23rd, 2017. Why do you ask?
Your tail light is on fire.
Look, I had a mid-life crisis too.
Leaving your mother-in-law's?
Yes, if you could please be on the lookout for anything unusual.
Cool your jets while I check your registration.
Just cool your jets okay?
"I'd say, 'where's the fire?' But the answer seems obvious.
Around here, the speed of sound is still 45.
You're fast and I'm furious.
Stop sign? I never saw the city!
Humbling, isn't it.
You're probably wondering how I caught you?
If you don't slow down, you won't get to where no one has gone before.
No, it's for littering. You dropped a solid rocket booster 5 miles back.
No you weren't speeding. But, at the light, you melted both cars behind you.
I adjusted the calculations to take relativistic effects into account and it still turns out you were speeding.
No seat belt, no helmet, no turn signals, no mirrors. I won't even ask if you passed emissions.
No, really, do you know how fast you were going, 'cause I have to put something down here.
No really, can you tell me how fast you were going?
You must not be from around here.
Your tag is expired. And it's melted.
You'll be cooling your jets for quite awhile.
Sir, I can't let off everyone desperately rushing to escape the planet.
What sort of mileage you get on this baby?
I know the difference between a Tesla Model S and a SpaceX Falcon 9, Mr. Musk. License and registration, please.
I've been clocking you for the last ten miles. If 25 mph is all you can do, you'll have to get off the highway.
Son, i dont think you understand the gravity of your situation
License and constellation, please.
I had you at Mach 2 in the school zone.
This one's from Illinois; this one's from Iowa; this one's from Nebraska and this one's from Wyoming. You're lucky I stopped you before you hit Idaho.
I clocked you at the speed of light, but I'll knock it down to the speed of sound.
I was traveling faster than the speed of light so I didn't see it turn red.
Do you know why I stopped you? It's not rocket science.
Go ahead, mach my day.
you realize you vaporized a cow back there?
License, registration, and flight plan...
I'm no rocket scientist, but you were speeding, sir
Running a red light, violating the speed of light, and 400,000 in a 40 mile zone.
It was the rocket's red glare that gave you away.
I realize The Force Was With You, sir, but the 27 lights you ran weren't.
Ejector seat or no ejector seat, you still have to wear a seatbelt.
Sorry officer, I spaced out.
I suppose you're wondering how I caught up with you.
Why can't you drive a Giant Hot Dog like a normal Nut-Job?
I don't know how I caught up to you either.
Registration and landing permit, please.
Well, let's start with the headlights...
You have a tail light out...and half of the last county is on fire.
Where's the fire - Alpha Centauri?
"No, that was not a speed limit sign, it was for Highway 675".
Your rear license plate has melted off
You changed lanes without signaling thirteen states ago.
OK, you can go now. But, please, don't restart your engine until I pull away.
Jetson, huh?
Sir, are you aware that you just ran 127 red lights?
I had to pee.
This is for flying under the radar.
Sir, time travel is not a traffic violation but your driver license expired 10,000 years ago.
You're in a school zone, and on Earth
You failed to signal before re-entry.
All right, sir, time to step out of the car and take one giant leap for mankind--and it had better be in a straight line.
How much Tang have you had?
Cool your jets, buddy.
You were exceeding the sound limit.
Don't for one minute think that this is the first time I've heard that 'time traveler' excuse.
The moon? Straight up, you can't miss it.
I'd like to give you a ticket but, unfortunately, we're now two states west of my jurisdiction.
Your turn signal has been on for the last 119 miles.
You must be from out-of-town.
Nice work, Einstein. It took me 25 years to pull you over.
License and launch manifest please.
You were going a little too boldly there.
Sir, were you aware that you're driving with a broken flux capacitor?
So just where is your kid's recital......Jupiter?
I'm officer Houston. We have a problem.
45 miles per what?
You can pay your fine as a lump sum or an annuity.
You city folks think you can come out here and break OUR sound barrier any old time.
Listen buddy, I want to leave the planet as much as anyone right now. But that's no excuse for speeding.
I'm not speeding, I'm making driving great again.
I just wanted to let you know your license plate is melting.
Next time pull over as soon as the siren catches up to you.
What on Earth made you think you could outrun a cruiser?
I don't care about the rules on your planet. You're in Kansas now.
You know you failed to signal when you passed me last Thursday.
I'm sorry officer, I was just trying to get through 2016.
License and re-entry authorization, please.
Because I couldn't catch the guy in the Tesla, that's why.
I'm not sure which surprises me more: your speed or the fact that I caught you.
Licence, registration, and Captain Jet decoder ring please.
No tail lights, no head lights, no turn indicators, no seat belts, no license plate. Ching, ching, ching.
It's taken 3 days to catch you - the least you can do is step out of the vehicle.
And where is this "Wookie" now?
We've been getting noise complaints from a neighboring state.
Hey buddy, you need to cool your jets.
I don't care that it's an Amazon Prime delivery.
Houston, we got a problem.
It's not the speed I'm concerned about, it's the texting.
I clocked you doing the speed of light in a speed of sound zone
License? This is my 7th Grade Science Fair Project.
No, sir. 620 is the number of the highway that you're on.
This is for going vertical in a horizonal lane.
Are you aware you missed a stop sign 325 miles ago?
Small penis?
Three guesses.
In order for me to not issue you a ticket you must agree to post on social media that I actually did manage to catch you.
Are there any vehicles in the weapon?
I'm impressed you funded this with Kickstarter, now try GoFundMe to pay for your ticket.
You touched down in a crosswalk.
No, sir . . . I will not sign your 'Captain's Log.'
Sir, your wife would like to know if you really meant to eject her back there.
Don't mach me son!
You wouldn't happen to know anything about that melted stretch of highway two miles back, would you?
You're a little late with your warnings from the future, the election was weeks ago.
Spare me the one about time dilation, the speed of light as a constant and inertial frames. Heard that one three times already today.
Your license says you're 67 years old but you don't look a day over 25. You been travelin' near the speed of light, son?
Your carbon footprint exceeds the state of Iowa
Sorry Officer, at the speed of sound I can't hear the siren.
Okay, now when I get back into my cruiser, I want you to wait for me to pull out first.
Do you have any idea how many miles per second you were going?
No, 287 is the highway number, not the speed limit
You will need to pick up a passenger if you're going to use the car pool lane.
Is this a hybrid?
Welcome back to Earth Mr. Musk, and our pesky little speed limit rules.
Sorry officer, I'm late for a launch date
You can't break the sound barrier in a school zone, sir.
So, you couldn't read the speed limit sign because it was a blur.
Oh ! Hi Mr. Leno
I let you off with a warning last time.
Do you know how fast you were going? Because it was awesome.
Your break lights are on fire.
Sorry sir... we're just testing Amazon's new five minute delivery program.
And don't ever mach me again!
Sir, you can't escape the long arm of the laws of physics.
Nope. You're weren't speeding. Pulled you over cause you have a taillight out.
Sir, please step out of the vehicle. I smell tang on your breath.
You should probably avoid Police chases with only 10 seconds of fuel...
...and for igniting two houses and a chihuahua.
Not in my solar system, you don't.
You flew through that stop sign.
Sir, this race ended in the '60s.
No, you didn't fail to signal. I'll give you two more guesses.
Oh I am so sorry. I thought you were black. Carry on!
License, registration, and penis size, please.
Is this just because I'm from out of state?
I will need to see your registration and black box.
I don't care what planet you will be on, be in court on Dec 15th.
You failed to indicate a left turn back in Ohio.
It's just a warning, cool your jets.
You were going t = t0/(1-v2/c2)1/2 in a traversable wormhole zone.
Sir, I clearly saw you texting.
You were going a little fast about 3 states back.
Lost in space is no excuse.
The rules of the road are simple, it's not rocket science.
Overcompensating just a bit, aren't we, sir?
I'm citing you for overcompensating.
Son, don't mach me.
Relax, you're white.
Do you know how I pulled you over?
Wow! And what does it get in the city?
You're probably wondering why I stopped you.
Where do you think you are, Texas?
So what brings you out here all the way from New York, Mr. Weiner?
And that's why in our galaxy we have the little white lines on the road.
Are you profiling me?
The real crime is that I was able to overtake you.
Spatial profiling?
Didn't you see your second stage fall off back there?
I've been chasing you since 2015.
FAA license and NASA registration, please
You know Mr. Musk I've heard it all when it comes to speeders, but telling me you were on your way to the international space station and lost the GPS signal, now that's a real stretch.
Uranus ! My Ass !
Do you have any idea how many land speed records you've broken?
I'm citing you for failing to yield to the boundaries of space and time.
Listen, buddy, following the speed limit isn't rocket science.
You're not from around here are you?
I don't care if you were trying to go back in time to change your vote.
I had you at mach 2 in a 55
Let's just say you were going somewhere between 55 miles per hour and the speed of light.
You were doing two thousand miles an hour in a 35 mile zone.
I'm about as close to our leader as you're gonna get.
Were you texting?
I'll give you a warning for your speeding but I have to ticket you for the emissions.
"This is for not wearing your parachute.
You ran a light back in New York...
I had a few Tangs officer, but that was hours ago.
License, registration, and M.I.T. degree please.
Your turn signal has been on for the last 300,000 miles.
I'm going to ask that you pull away gently, without incinerating my cruiser.
Bet you didn't know a Crown Victoria could do 4.9 miles per second.
Not sure if your license plate sticker is expired, but I do know it's melted.
It only has one speed.
You failed to use your turn signal back in Chicago.
I suppose you're wondering how I caught you.
A Hummer just didn’t do it for you?
Oh please, I was going MUCH faster than that!
Speeding?! It took twelve minutes for you to be wanted in three states.
I'll write your speeding ticket as soon as the MIT Department of Physics gets back to me with the calculations
No, actually, I couldn't even theoretically hear your siren.
Pilot's license and registration, please.
Well, well, Mr. Musk. Seems this one didn't get off the ground either.
No you weren't speeding, but I'm gonna go out on a limb and say you're in violation of emissions standards.
I don't care that you are a rocket scientist!
Do you know how many miles per second you were going?
Been getting some calls about strange behavior out here today. Seen anything?
I'm sorry, but you'll have to pay for the sound barrier you just broke.
So the signs are NOT in the thousands of miles per hour?
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what is about to happen.
I'll just give you a warning this time, but let me pull away before you start up.
It's not rocket science. You were speeding.
So you say you purchased this used from a...Mr. Coyote?
No sir, I do not know what the penalty is for doing the speed of light in a 25 mph zone.
Well for starters, failure to keep on the ground.
And please don't say, 'Houston, I've got a problem.'
Yes, we all want to. But the inauguration's still a month away.
It appears you have failed our emissions test
And in addition you're in a no-fly zone.
I'm running late for a launch date.
Let me pull away before you start her up.
I'm no rocket scientist but I am still sure you were speeding
Is this a hybrid?
What's your hurry, son?
Mid-life crisis eh?
Yes, and I'm Batman. Now get out of the car and show me your license.
So, what's it like on fuel?
Speed Is Relative.
If you were really from the future, this thing would be self-driving.
Sir, the space race is over.
That's one fast police car you got there, Officer!
I don't care if you were obeying the laws of thermodynamics.
And if I could write you up for blatant phallic compensation attempt, I would as well.
What made you think you might be faster than me?
Are you mach-ing me?
Are you aware that you went through a stop light in Kansas?
In a hurry, Major Tom?
Sure buddy, the Doppler effect made the light appear green.
Besides going 28,000 mph in a 40 mph zone, I'll have to cite for not having your seatbelt secured.
No, Sir. The speed limit signs were there when you approached them. And there is the additional issue of the 50 smoldering mailboxes.
35 in a 25, rolling a stop sign, and barbecuing a tailgater.
I'm so sorry, sir. I thought you were black.
Is there a problem, officer?
Your right taillight has melted
Get that taillight fixed, and no more sonic booms.
Actually officer a light-year measures distance not speed.
How 'bout you boldly go to your wallet and hand me your license and registration?
You seem like a nice guy, I'm gonna knock it down to ten below the sound barrier.
. . . and this one's for not having a front plate on the vehicle
Do not restart your vehicle.
Cool your jets. I'm only giving you a warning.
So, I take it that you're not from around here.
Scotty, the nerd from 7th grade science class...so we meet again.
I'm telling you to basically cool your jets.
Yes, but do YOU know how fast I was going?
You can tell Houston that your right tail light is out!
And you also barbecued enough cattle to feed half of Tennessee...
License and flight plan...
You were texting.
You know one of your afterburners is out.
I need to see you license, registration and flight plan.
Drivers licence registration and autograph please
Any particular reason you were doing 550 in a 55?
No! I'm late for launch, not lunch!
Do you know how many miles per second you were going?
Save it, buddy. I hear that old 'afterburner got stuck' story all the time.
But Officer I'm white...
Test pilot, eh? If I had a dime for every time I heard that one...
The speed of light isn't just a good idea; it's the law.
Me, profiling?
Since the election, some people just can't get to Canada fast enough.
I know you're violating SOMETHING; I just don't know what.
I went through a midlife crisis myself, so this time I'll just give you a warning.
Gotta plane to catch?
The radar gun says you were doing "error" in a 35mph zone.
Chin up, you still might break the record for fastest conviction.
I'm writing you up for defying the laws of physics.
It's not for speeding, but for ostentatiousness.
You were flying back there.
I'm sorry, sir, but this is fly OVER country.
You're being ticketed for driving in the wrong century.
Four hundred is the county road number, not the speed limit.
This is Cape Cod, sir... Cape Canaveral is south of here.
Not from around here, eh?
I'm just giving you a warning. You were going mach 2 in a 35 mph zone. I don't even know how to write that ticket.
The 21st century, why do you ask?
I clocked you doing 17,000 in a 55.
Let me pull out first , before you start her back up Mr. Branson.
Sir, I'm no idiot. That's Tang on your breath.
Please eject out of the rocket sir
OK, buddy. You know 17 of your tail lights are out.
Now you're probably wondering how I caught you.
Breaking the sound barrier is disturbing the peace.
This is a car pool only lane.
Do you have any weapons, including missiles, of which I should be aware?
Didn't you see those 500 stop signs back there?
You've got a melted tail light.
Are you sure it was me?
We're stopping suspected aliens.
I'll need your license and registration, then get out so, I can take a selfie.
Need I say it? Cool your jets.
Your tail light is on fire.
I'm going to have to write you up for breaking the sound barrier.
My wife's having a baby on Mars.
No, I will not take you to my leader.
One of your afterburners is out.
Are you trying to Mach me?
I need you to understand the gravity of this situation
Leaving the country in a a hurry, are we?
Officer, the speed limit is all relative
I don't care if your name is Sully, you can't land that here
Looks like you get to set two records today.
Your license plate light is out.
Oh sorry, I thought you were black.
Launch sequence and registration?
Sorry officer, I spaced out.
Sir, are you aware that you were going the speed of light on a road with a 25 mph limit?
I'm surprised you didn't take off when you saw me coming
We have a problem, Houston.
Do you have any idea how I was able to stop you?
This is major, Tom.
You know it's illegal to pass in an ozone.
You couldn't hear my siren, because you were passing through the sound barrier.
Let me guess......you didn't notice the 'Do Not Break the Sound Barrier' signs back there.
I have reason to believe you may be smuggling illegal aliens.
You flew past that stop sign.
The turnoff to the Salt Lake is in Utah. This is Kansas.
Ran out of plutonium, did you?
Sorry, officer, I didn't know I broke the sound barrier until I stopped and heard your siren.
Pilot's licence please.
Sir, the sound barrier is not a speed limit.
This is a no-fly zone.
Let me guess. Canada?
License, registration and Commander Cody secret decoder ring.
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to read the posted speed limit.
Don't let me see you on this planet again, Understood?
I'm letting you off for the speeding, OK? But I gotta write you up for the sonic boom.
No you weren't speeding, but you left a hell of a mess on Route 64 when you ejected your second stage.
That NASA fire sale is keeping us real busy.
I'm sorry, I can't issue you a warning. Breaking the sound barrier is really over the line.
Please step out of the unconscious compensation for your sexual inadequacy.
Sir, do you know how many laws of physics you just broke?
So, this thing a hybrid?
I don't have any idea how fast you were going.
Why would you even pull over?
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out why I pulled you over.
The tail light's not actually out, you just have to wait two years to see it.
I didn't ask for your pilot's license.
Yeah, like I haven't heard that one before.
Sorry, Officer. I was totally spacing.
I don't care if it is 'the next obvious iteration,' it's still illegal, Mr. Musk.
No, it was your busted taillights this time, Mr. Yeager.
Yes, it's a parallel universe . . . so it's still 35 miles an hour.
All right, buddy. Where's your helmet?
So, I’m writing you a ticket for speeding, and gross overcompensation.
Ok Major Tom, let's see your registration.
Yeah, like I've never heard that one before.
Some of our pizza customers live out-of -state sir.
You're probably wondering how I caught up to you.
Sorry Major Tom, but your drivers license expired in 1969.
Technically it's a missile, so the NRA says I have every right to carry it.
License, registration, and flight plan, please.
A time machine? An attempt to change recent history? Carry on and God speed.
Are you mach-ing me?
No, your speed was fine....it's your front bumper that's not acceptable.
Trade ya.
And I'm giving you a second ticket for the booster rocket you left on the road back there.
Nobody outruns the Blue Phantom, sir.
You Jet Set people always think you can avoid a ticket.
Twice I saw you make a left turn without signaling.
I'll let you off with a warning if you let me pull away first.
Listen, buddy, I don't care if it's street legal on Mars.
Oh, you're gonna set a record - just not the one you were shooting for.
Why did you even stop?
Don't expect to achieve escape velocity while I'm on duty, buster.
Next time don’t wait for the sonic boom before you check your speedometer.
Sorry, officer...I'm just trying to get to Canada as fast as I can.
This is just a warning. Next time don't fly over the stop sign.
Honest, officer. I just touched the gas and it took off like a rocket.
The points are going to be astronomical.
I can't just give you a ticket for having a mid-life crisis.
Oh, you set the record alright. Biggest fine I've ever handed out.
We've had reports of a sonic boom.
So,what's the big hurry?
You were going Mach 3 in a Mach 1.
Hey buddy, you need to cool your jets.
If you're a rocket scientist, how come I caught you?
Out of curiosity, how do you make a left turn in this bad boy?
This is area 52. A lot of people make that mistake.
What year in the future are you from? Well, in that case your tags are expired too.
So, what's our hurry?
The land speed record isn't the only record you're going to set today, Pal.
Hey, cool your jets.
You see officer, the Doppler effect made the red light look green...
I clocked you at 16,640 miles per hour in a 35 miles per hour zone.
Just cool your jets, and everything'll be fine.
You can see my driver's license - but you won't be able to read it without your Buck Rogers decoder ring.
You've got T minus three seconds to show me your license and registration.
Dammit Elon.
We use turn signals around here, buddy.
You ran a sound barrier back there.
Do you know how fast you we're going? That's not a rhetorical question; my radar gun doesn't go that high ...
Mid-life crisis eh?
You are probably going to notice a rate adjustment on your insurance.
You know you have a melted tail light?
Sorry, you're still not flying under the radar.
Texting while thrusting is not permitted.
Sir, I'm going to need you to step out of your vehicle and give me a sobriety test.
No, you just have a tail light out.
Radar picked you up at 35 mph in a 30 mph speed zone.
Doesn't look like a hybrid to me.
I'm going to need your license, registration and one helluva explanation.
Sir, did you know that you’re driving with a melted taillight?
Let's start with your smog certificate.
I'm sorry sir but reentry speed in this state is still 55 mph.
This is an HOV lane.
No, the ticket isn't for speeding. It is for the bus you incinerated back in town.
Are you aware your left tail light is broken?
Technically speaking I wasn't driving to fast, I was just flying to low.
Is there a problem, officer?
How exactly did you catch me officer?
I didn't pull you over for speeding, it's your carbon footprint.
I'm gonna let you go on the 37,000 in a 65, but your left tail light's out.
A satellite phone is still a phone, sir.
I'll need to see your driver's license, pilot's licence, flight plan and smog certificate.
Do you know how I stopped you.
It's the Trump sticker, isn't it?
Radar had you at 7,534 mph but I am going to write the ticket for 20 over. Happy Holidays son and slow down.
Nice try, but you've got until January 20 to make it to Canada.
Compensating much?
This can all go away if I can drive.
I need to see you license, registration and flight plan.
No, not driving too fast. You were flying too low.
Your license plates expired three light years ago.
You failed to use your directional signal when you turned left twelve hundred miles ago.
You know you were going the speed of light in a speed of sound zone?
I pulled you over for rocketeering.
You failed to signal before reentry, sir.
Hope your insurance covers a broken sound barrier.
You singed a cow on the last curve.
no, it's definitely earth ...
Ground control? You're lookin' at him, Tom.
No front plate.
You weren't speeding but you were in the HOV lane.
You were doing Mach 3 in a Mach 1 zone.
It's for excessive overcompensation.
Traveling at the speed of light doesn't sound cool now, does it?
Because you were texting.
I'm sorry officer. I had a plane to catch.
No, Mr. Musk, this is Ohio.
Looks like you get to set two records today.
I'm sorry officer, I didn't even see that sound barrier.
Global entry and registration.
What is it this time, Elon?
George Jetson, meet Officer Muldoon.
Relax, I just want to know what kind of mileage you get?
License, registration, and launch orders please.
You need a new muffler
Don't know how fast you were going? That makes two of us.
No Officer, I was going way too fast to see the speed limit
Sir, do you know why I stopped you?
You failed to use your turn signal two states ago.
I understand that it was an emergency landing but you still blew right through that stop sign.
Do you have any idea why I pulled you over?
Sorry, you're still in America.
I don't think your boss meant to take *this* shuttle to the airport.
No, Officer. I'm not in any particular hurry.
Did you know that your left afterburner was out?
I assume you know how fast you were going.
Sorry about this speeding ticket, but if I let it go everyone would use that excuse.
We're more down to earth around here.
Next time I see you, you better be going up.
I don’t care that your wife took the Tesla, Mr. Musk.
Even at the speed of sound, you should've seen the flashing lights
Nice, and now you have the speeding fine record also.
I’m only going to write you up for the sound barrier.
Did you really think you could outrun me?
License, registration, and speed limit in the year you traveled from, please.
Well, just for openers you broke the sound barrier... in a school zone
Do you know how I pulled you over?
I'll give you a warning if you promise to help my kid with his science project.
And don't start your car until I have gone ahead of you!
I need you to step out of the vehicle for a field sobriety test. Please take one small step for man and one giant leap for mankind.
and you say you've never been stopped before.
Your exhaust incinerated three cars at the last intersection.
A Maserati wasn't good enough?
License, registration, and Environmental Impact Statement, please.
Did you know you're driving with three bald tires?
Your registration expired a light year ago.
Ignorance of the law of gravity is no excuse.
Going to live on the moon is not a viable response to a Trump presidency.
World record or no world record, you didn't signal back there
Did you know your tail lights are on fire?
I don't care that your son is an Honors Student
Don't be silly, officer. I was going waaay faster than that!
I am going to have to cite you for breaking and entering the sound barrier.
Immigration papers, please.
I have to cite you for speeding, but I can overlook breaking the sound barrier.
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that you blew through that stop sign.
This is registered as a hybrid?
Sorry officer, I just spaced out.
I'm sorry, but this is an off-road vehicle sir.
You're a long way from Cape Canaveral, kid...
I'm gonna knock it down to mach 1 to help you with the points seeing how you were nice enough to wait for me and all.
It comes to $184,752 or you can see the judge on Thursday.
Having a blast were you?
I understand, sir, but you can make it to Canada before Inauguration Day without driving 950 miles per hour.
I had you clocked at Mach 3 in a Mach 2 zone.
Heading to Canada I assume?
Nope! Tail light.
Yes, a record. No, not in a good way.
Look, I get it, we're all in a rush to get out of this year.
Your emissions sticker as expired.
You're not wearing a seatbelt.
Do you have any idea how slow time was going?
The problem? You flew over a red light.
No, it's not a speeding ticket. It's an emissions citation.
Did I forget to signal on re-entry?
Your brake lights melted.
Ok, I'll just give you a warning, but stay off your cellphone.
I gotta admit, that was one heck of a U-Turn.
I'll let you off this time. But next time, don't forget to signal when entering the atmosphere.
License and proof of sanity please
You ain't from 'round this planet, are y' boy?
Sir, do you have any idea why I pulled you over?
I'm no rocket scientist, but it appears you are suffering from projectile dysfunction
Keep your hands off your joystick.
I’ve got you clocked at Mach 2 in a 40 mph zone.
Do you know why I stopped you?
Your left rear rocket thrustor indicator light is out.
Registration, insurance and flight plan, please.
I don't know where you're from, but that kind of thing doesn't fly around here.
Your license plate has melted.
When was the last time you updated your GPS?
Do you know why I'm stopping you?
You can't exceed the speed of light.
Nope, it is not your taillight. Guess again.
Your tail lights are smoking.
Have another guess, sir. Warp 1 isn't even close.
Canada?
Do you know why I pulled you over, Mr. Musk?
Let's try and keep it under the limit, at least till you reach the Canadian border.
You were on my radar.
You were good till you got in the HOV lane.
The day you reach light speed will be the day you don't get pulled over.
I don't care. You still have to signal!!
When was your last emissions inspection?
You guys just can't get to Canada fast enough can you?
Are you maching me, young man?
License, registration and proof of sanity.
I don't care if you're moving to Canada, sir, you need to slow down.
Well the texting is just the icing on the poor judgment cake.
Yes, I'm the guy from the Elton John song.
Please keep your tiny hands where I can see them.
This is one small ticket for man, one giant...
You were breaking the sound barrier. Also, your tail light is out.
I'm telling you -- the speed of light isn't just a good idea, it's the law.
Dude, didn't think I'd catch you?
Do you know you"re driving with a defective flux-capacitor?"
You were doing the speed of light but I'm only writing you up for the speed of sound.
Please step out of the rocket and count backwards from 10
I'll just give you a test ticket, then.
Please tell me you know why I stopped you.
Just a warning. The shock cones on your port aft booster looked a bit wobbly. Ought to check those nozzle skirts.
And I thought I had a tiny penis!
Elon? Could you spell that please?
Sir you were doing speed-of-light in a speed-of-sound zone.
Could you turn down the Elton John?
I'm giving you a ticket for the speeding and a high-five for the landing.
I found it at a yard sale after he abolished NASA.
You're probably wondering *how* I pulled you over.
I clocked you at 17,500 mph, but I wrote this out for 42 in a 35 zone, so there won't be any points.
The fact I caught up to you should tell you this isn't as cool as it looks.
We got a report from Houston that this vehicle is hot.
No, really....HOW did you convince your wife to let you get this!
Where do you put the groceries
If it was a record, then how did I catch you?
I'm fairly confident it was you, not the white minivan, traveling 600 miles per hour over the speed limit.
I couldn't help but notice you didn't make a full stop back there.
Yes, Mr. President Elect... it is huge.
Sir, the space race is over.
I have to admit. I wasn't sure what it would take for me to pull over a white guy...
Im giving you a speeding ticket. It doesn't take rocket science to figure it out.
Don't make me say: "Do you know why I pulled you over?'
If I see you on this planet again you can bet it will be more than a warning.
Sir, did you realize your taillights have melted?
I bet you have really small feet.
Sorry, sir. You can't speed through the next four years.
You in a hurry?
You say you were driving at the speed of sound and you couldn't hear me?
I can't tell you how fast you were going, but let's just say my radar gun melted.
Yeah, it's the speeding, but it's really about the two states you just torched.
evidently not fast enough
State law requires you to have a front license plate.
But officer, I have to get to Canada before January 20th!
I could cite you for failing to stop at the sound barrier, but you melted all the bugs off my car, so I'm letting you go with a warning.
Do you have any weapons I should know about?
I don't care what star ship you're from, I need proof of insurance.
You were absolutely flying.
This must be soooome midlife crisis.
Need a booster?
I'm letting you off with a warning this time, but let's keep it under the sound barrier.
The posted speed limit is not in miles per minute.
And this one is for catching you.
When was the last time this thing had a smog test?
And, this is a carpool lane.
How much to take me with you?
Do you really not know why I pulled you over?
Look, you and I both know you're just trying to meet this month's quota.
I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.
Any idea why I stopped you?
Impossible - this flies under the radar.
Did you know you were doing 3,000 in a 30 mile per hour zone?
In these parts I am the leader.
Do you know you were doing Mach .9215 in a Mach .0657 zone?
Yeah, since the election everyone's trying to get out of town in a hurry.
I'm sorry officer, I couldn't get to Canada fast enough
Your sonic booms are disturbing our free-range chickens.
Just try to keep it under Mach 1, okay?
The phosphor diffusion dome on the light emitting diode in the seventh position of your left-rear-tail-light array is malfunctioning
Alright Bud, where's the supernova?
OK, sir, when's the last time you had those emissions tested?
Just a warning for now, but next time make sure you stay subsonic in residential areas, OK?
Quick, I have come from the future to warn you about an election.
I'm sure you are a little surprised I caught up to you, Mr. Musk.
Well, the speed of light may be relative where you come from sir, but around here it's a hundred and eighty-six thousand miles a second, and I clocked you at one-ninety.
Do you have any idea how fast you were going? I sure don't ...
I'll be citing you for one sonic boom.
Your left-turn signal's been on for the past 300 miles.
I pulled you over because you were doing Mach 1.2 in a 55mph zone.
And there's also the little matter of burning bridges.
Don't mach the law, son.
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time.
Never mach a cop.
Right tail light is broken
Legally, this is a motorcycle since it only has 3 wheels. I'll need to see your motorcycle license, sir.
No, I would not like to see you do a wheelie.
I'll let you go with a warning this time, but get that tail light fixed.
Pilot's license and registration.
Okay, pal, where's the nova?
Busted tail light?
If I can catch you, you'd better take it back to the shop.
Congratulations. Send it to Guinness after paying your three hundred bucks.
And where is the fire, sir?
The old I-traveled-forward-in-time excuse for expired plates, eh?
Even I don't know how I caught up to you.
You were going Mach 2 in a school zone.
I see you have quite a few unpaid parking tickets.
What's your second guess?
Mr. Gordon... or would you prefer "Flash"?
I guess you didn't hear my siren while you were breaking the sound barrier.
You're probably wondering *how* I pulled you over.
Yeah, you also broke the law barrier.
License, registration, proof of insurance, & U-235 fuel authorization.
Street legal? I'm not even sure if this is sky legal.
In my defense, I thought I was flying beneath the radar.
Sorry sir, but there's a new rule around here. No texting while rocketing.
So . . . you know why I pulled you over, right?
For breaking and entering the sound barrier.
Sir, do you know why I pulled you down?
By definition, it's only a tricycle.
Of course I was speeding but how in the world did you catch me?
Or . . . you let me take her for a few laps and we call it a broken tail light.
Your License shows Neptune, do you still live at that address?
I don't care if you're the CEO of "SpaceX" you were going 300 in a 35.
That your booster engine back there in the culvert?
No, Frank Gordon. Flash is my brother.
You do know that the Darwin Award is not a trophy?
What do you mean "are we still in Kansas?"
You from outta state?
Please sir, I'm gonna be late for the launch party.
Your insurance premiums must be sky high.
Sir, are you aware your left tail light is out?
To prevent any further suspicions, can you please open your trunk?
Why do you think I pulled you over?
I think it's gonna be a long, long time Rocket Man
Did you know you hit a speed bump in South Carolina and landed here in Virginia?
Sir, did you know that you have a taillight out?
Rocket scientist, I presume.
In a hurry to leave the planet?
All right, where's the Supernova?
You were doing 3,200 in a 35 mph zone
Did you realize that you have a broken tail light?
Did you know your tail lamp is on fire?
You flew passed a stop sign.
"Do you have any idea what your carbon footprint is?
You'll also be having an end-life crisis if you continue going at that speed.
Your left taillight is vaporized sir.
Couldn't help but notice you weren't wearing a seatbelt.
How long have you been working for Uber?
Sorry, I didn't even see that town...
I'm guessing you failed your emissions test.
Do you have any idea how low you were flying?!
Yes, I know we are in Kansas, but when you passed through Boston, I noticed your broken tail light.
Well your not going to get to Mars today!
I wish I had a dollar for every time I've heard that one.
Is my tail light out again?
Afterburners are illegal in this state.
Too much ego in a pastoral zone.
But I AM cooling my jets officer!
Sir, you are required to have a front license plate
Since you refused the breathalyzer, please get out of the car and take one small step for man and one giant leap for mankind.
Cool your jets, you just need to repair that tail light.
Where's the quasar, buddy?
You were clocked at 48,006 entering our atmosphere.
I saw the election results. I'm going to let you off with a warning. Welcome to Canada.
Rocket Man, it's been a long, long time.
That's the third 'bathroom' excuse I've heard today.
I guess you'll just have to be late for your ComicCon convention.
This is a win-win: you just set a new land speed record and the amount of this ticket I can coast on the job for the next 10 years.
It's not rocket science.
What on earth were you thinking?"!?
Speeding? I was taking off.
I'll let you off if you let me take it for a spin.
That wasn't just the sound barrier you broke back there.
No officer, I don't know why you pulled me over
Thanks for the tow.
. . . and it'll be an extra $200 for breaking my radar gun.
No, I will NOT tell you how fast you were going!
I'll let you go, but hey, cool your jets, man!
Frankly, if you were driving the Lockheed Stealth model, my radar would never have picked you up.
Sir, are you aware that you have a tail light out?
I'm charging you with Driving While Ballistic.
Your left blinker is out.
I ran your license, you have an unpaid speeding ticket from Mars.
I got you doing 600 in a 30 miles per hour zone, but I'll do you a favor and only put 590 on the ticket.
Alright mister...cool your jets!
I'm impressed that you broke Mach 3, but you still need to signal your turn.
It's OK, I'm a rocket scientist.
A 'failure to launch' citation . . . really?!!
Did you know that your right rear brake light is out?
Didn't you see the sign, this is a no fly zone!
Did you know we have a decibel limit in this town?
Do you realize you were going Mach 3 in a 55-mile-an-hour zone?
I don't care if it was a perfect landing
I don't care if you come from 2056, I still need to see license and registration.
Were you aware that you were going 35,940 miles per hour over the speed limit?
A rocket scientist, I take it?
I wanted to get some use of it before funding is cut.
What do you mean you doubted the rumour of intelligent beings here on earth sir...
Thanks for pulling over.
Let me guess. They ran out of rental cars at the airport.
No, you weren't speeding, but your turn signal's melted.
No, you weren't speeding. Your tail light is out
Did you know you had a tail light out?
license, registration, black box
I'm sorry officer, I didn't hear the siren.
Were you aware you were going Mach 5 in a Mach 3 zone?
So you're not the man they think you are at home?
Sir, do you have any idea which planet you're on?
Eject.
You must be the new head of the EPA?
'How much Tang have you had today/"
I'll give you a warning this time, but keep it under Mach 1 from now on.
Okay pal, where's the supernova?
Sorry for stopping you, Sir; you were going so fast I didn't see you're white.
Afternoon Sir, did you know you've got a tail light out?
It's a shuttle service
Are you aware your tail lights are out?
Don't be a wise guy. I'll ask you one more time: Where on earth are you coming from?
Is that your booster rocket back about 600 miles?
Area 51 exit is 2 miles down on the right.
Officer, you've got one hell of a patrol car there!
Well, Mr. Astronaut, the only space you're in now is mine.
You broke my radar.
Did you know that both of your tail lights are burnt out?
License and explanation.
Sir, I know this is upsetting, but please cool your jets.
What's seems to be the problem officer...
If it means anything, I work for Richard Branson
I'm going to have to cite you for going nowhere fast, sir.
For once there is actually no rule about this.
I can tell - You're not from around here - are you.....
Is this one of those Tesla's I've been hearing so much about?
The runway is that long landing strip with bright lights usually attached to an airport.
So it's driverless and you are just the stewardess? I don't think so.
Are you maching me, young man?
Do you not know why I pulled you over?
How fast? Isn't it your job to tell me?
No, you're about 2,000 miles east of Bonneville
Do you know how fast you were going? I would love to know.
Seatbelt?
No, I can't forget it just this once.
My other car is a Prius.
I wanted you to feel the Burn
Let's start with the fact that your inspection sticker has expired, and go from there....
What do you mean Tesla merged with SpaceX?!
I knew you'd run out of gas eventually, so I just followed your smoke trail.
Flying low, aren't we?
Mr. Houston, we have a problem.
We're going to need a bigger tow truck.
Not your driver's license. Your pilot's license.
I may now be younger than my license indicates.
I will let you off with a warning if you let me take it for a spin.
License and alien registration card please.
What's the hurry?
I'll let you go this time, but just because you came in peace for all mankind.
Do you know why I'm pulling you over?
Is that Sully with a "y"?
Officer what seems to be the problem?
Let me pull out before you engage the boosters.
There are limits to white privilege, sir.
Well Rocket Man, I think it's going to be a long, long time before you see your family again.
It was all about the boom, sir.
Well, at least you're not drunk.
I have friends in high places.
Sir, have you consumed any Tang this evening?
Are you hiding any illegal aliens?
I truly did not know where the registration sticker was supposed to go.
Sorry, but I'm not buying the 'broken speedometer' excuse.
The bad news is you're under arrest. The good news is you set a new land speed record.
Do you have any idea how low you were flying?!
It's a good thing you're white
Why me? I’ve been passed six times in the last mile.
Do you know how fast you were going? Because I don't.
We stop anyone who looks like an alien.
Sir, your carbon-footprint is larger than your vehicle.
Nice rig, sir, but I'm going to have to fine you for my melted windshield—and that pointy thing has got to go.
Talk about a midlife crisis!
Your warp speed light is out.
Your tail light is broken.
I literally can't drive 55.
Your plates are expired, just like the shuttle program.
It's just a citation this time but you'd better get that thruster fixed.
I'm going to let you off with my ex-wife's address.
You were really flying back there.
You were three light years over the speed limit.
Speed limits aren't rocket science.
I thought you guys were only stopping illegal aliens.
Mach 3 is over the limit no matter where you're driving, sir.
Did you know you were going past the speed of light in a school zone?
It's your tail lights. They keep setting the cars behind you on fire.
Do you have any idea how phallic you were going?
Cool your jets or I'll write you another.
I understand Trump won, but you can't just leave the planet sir.
I'm afraid you were going Mach 5 in a school zone.
What does "Black Lives Matter" have to do with this? My radar says you were going 1000 miles per hour In a 50 zone.
Mind if we take a selfie?
Texting in an Atlas Delta IV, are we?
You asked why I stopped you, How about because "YOU WERE TEXTING!"
I'll pay you $100 to take a selfie where it looks like I'm giving you a speeding citation."
I'd like to look in your trunk.
You didn't hear the siren?
The reason I stopped you is because your front plate is missing.
If I was going that fast, how did you catch me
Do you know how long it's taken me to catch up to you?
Are you living here legally, sir?
Your left afterburner is out.
I understand your hurry to get to Canada, but there is still plenty of time before Inauguration Day.
So, you're saying you had to speed up to avoid hitting a meteor?
Did you know your tail light is out?
I don't care if it spoils the aerodynamics. You have to have a front bumper.
Were you aware you have a tail light out?
The fine for 4500 in a 35 is...do you have a calculator?
Sorry, officer - I was just trying to get to the Canada border before they finish building the wall.
There once was a man from Docket, Who’s car was a very large rocket. 	When stopped by police, For breaking the peace, said, “It’s just an old Oldsmobile Rocket!”
Sir, are you aware your left side booster is out?
Any chance of you bringing this thing to my son's birthday party?
You're telling me to cool my jets?
And lastly, let me pull out before you fire this up again.
I'm sorry officer. It's a rental and I did not realize how fast it was going
Is there a reason why you were going 7,000 miles per hour in a 50 mile per hour zone?
This is your last warning, Mr. Musk -- cars on the road, rockets in the sky.
So you're telling me you didn't see the sound barrier back there?
It does not matter where you are from. In this universe, the speed of light is the absolute limit.
Is there a problem, Earthling Authority Figure?
I don't care if your father walked on Mars. You're still getting a ticket.
Where's the fire?
You took off like a rocket back there.
What year is this?
Faster than the speed of light, Bub. You can't do that.
Do you realize you doing 1,285 in a 35 zone?
No, we can't just say the dimming glow of your afterburners is like a brake light.
Don't explain...mid-life crisis and they were out of red corvettes
How fast do you think you were going?
You were going 24,975 miles per hour over the speed limit.
I don't care how quickly you want to get to Canada.
Thanks for waiting.
Hi, I am from the future. I am looking for baby named Donald Trump?
I had you clocked at the speed of light in a speed of sound zone.
Ok, on Mars you can go as fast as you like, but in Cayuga County we like 55.
One of your tail lights is busted
I wasn't speeding. Iwas just landing.
Do you know why I pulled you down?
Not so fast, wise guy--this is a pilot's license.
We call it our stealth radar.
Do you know why I pulled you out of orbit, sir?
No sir, I'm citing you for literally burning up the road.
Good afternoon, sir. Are you aware that your left rear tail light is out?
Sorry Officer, I just wanted to make sure I made it out of the country before January 20th.
Sir, I'm going to need to see the results of your emission test.
Do you have any idea how high you were going?
Let me guess. Canada?
Following the speed limit isn't rocket science.
No, I was not spacial profiling.
You mean my ground speed? No idea. Want to see my escape velocity?
Your turn signal is burned out.
Did you know your right taillight is out?
Passport and registration, please.
As a matter of fact, officer, it is rocket science.
Okay Mr. Time Traveler, if you're from four years the future, tell me the winner of the World Series and the Presidential election in 2016?
Let me guess, you were spacing out?
Yes, I'm sure the radar gun was registering you and not that Volkswagen Beetle.
Are you aware you were doing 25,000 in a 45mph zone?
No, your tail lights were fine.
Where's your helmet?
Are you aware you have a broken tail light?
We have a law against warp speed in this county, mister.
Do you know that your taillight is out?
You almost made five simultaneous yellow lights.
D'ja know you have a taillight out?
Sorry, but your excuse that you were about to be 'late for launch' just won't cut it.
Rocket Fuel!?!... were you drinking it or driving it?
Both of your taillights are burned out.
I'm just issuing you a warning this time, cool your jets!
Your rear license plate is missing.
I was?
Well, you've certainly set a record for road kill
Sir, I suggest you buckle your seat belt.
Did you know your tail lights are burned out?
Sir, are you aware that you were going 17,640 in a 40 mph zone?
Flying a little low, aren't we.
You blew right through a stop sign back there, and a tree, and a barn, and...
You from around these parts?
Any reason why you were speeding?
Yes, Sir, zero to 60 in .0001 is awesome, but it ain't legal.
No, if you were speeding I couldn't have caught you. But I'm guessing you are going to fail the smog test, not to mention the three birds you barbecued back there.
EZ PASS doesn't mean you can drive OVER the toll booth.
I'm trying to figure how I caught up to you as well.
I'm making America fast again.
Do you even know where Canada is?
The m in 20 mph is for miles, not mach.
Please step out of the vehicle, Mr. Musk.
Sir, I don't care what you're making great again.
Jets fan?
I don't care if you are Chuck Yeager.
You were doing 600 in a 65.
Do you have any idea what the fine is for going 922 in a 65 zone?
Bruce Wayne? Why does that name sound familiar?
I passed stage one of your rocket 400 miles back, so there'll be an additional fine for littering.
I don't care if you were trying to get away from the election results
I'm citing you for flying under my radar.
Sir, Texas law requires side view mirrors on all road traffic.
This is a no-fly zone.
So welcome to fly-over country.
Know why I pulled you down?
First of all, you have no beard; secondly, you have no toys; and finally, that is not a red nose.
I had you going 10,000mph in a 50mph zone.
Sir, did you realize you were going mach 0.0912 in a mach 0.0584 zone?
Wow, you really flew through that stop sign back there...
Thats right; twenty seven in a twenty five zone.
Do you know how fast "I" was going?
Let's see ... doing Mach 2 in a school zone & failure to stop within 3 miles ... yea buddy, it'll be pricey.
Can you explain why you were going so fast ?
Trump! That's why so fast, officer. Canada isn't far enough, I'm going to Mars.
Elton John?
Sir, this isn't rocket science. Just please step out of the vehicle.
I profiled you as a speeder.
Your right blinker is out. You could really hurt someone.
The North Koreans are demanding the return of their 'Miata.'
I don't care if it stalls out under 250.
Your tail light is defective.
I'll give you a break and cite you for just Mach 2.
I know you're in a big hurry to get to Canada, but you still have to obey traffic laws.
For not wearing a helmet.
fifty three thousand in a thirty-five zone. This one's gonna cost you.
Sir, do you know why I pulled you over?
Did you know that one of your tail lights is burned out?
Do you know why I had you pull over yesterday?
Yeah you rolled right through that stop sign.
Your tail light is out.
Pilot's license and registration, please.
Do you know why I'm pulling you over? You LITERALLY blew through that stop sign.
Mach two. That's why you didn't hear the siren.
Your ticket is going to be out of this world.
I understand all that, but your taillight is still out.
You have a little time, sir- Trump isn't President until January 20th
I stopped you because you've got a broken cloaking device.
You know your left thruster's out, sir?
Did you know you were doing Mach 2 in a 50 mph zone?
Both your tail lights are burned out
I noticed you were using a hand held mobile device
I just wanted to ask what kind of mileage you get.
Both your tail lights burned out.
Please, officer, one more ticket and my insurance premium will skyrocket!
Are you aware you took one giant leap through that red light?
We all want to be out of here before he takes office, but you can't drive that fast on these roads.
Radar doesn't lie sir, you were doing Mach 5 in a 35 zone...
Do you have any idea how fast you were Boeing?
Wow, breaking the sound barrier in a school zone. This is gonna cost you, buddy.
I'll let you go this time if you promise not to make another sonic boom.
Did you know that you have a burnt taillight?
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to guess why I pulled you over.
What's the problem, officer?
You do realize that was a 'No Re-entry Zone' back there?
Do you know why I stopped you?
I don't care if the speed limit isn't posted, the sound barrier isn't a good rule of thumb.
Your left thruster light is out.
I had you doing 2 Mach in a school zone
really?
In case you are wondering why I pulled you over, you popped that whole cornfield back there without the owner's permission.
You know you were doing Mach 2 in a Mach 1 zone?
...And, you are not wearing a seat belt.
Are you aware your registration expired two light-years ago?
It's not rocket science, the speed limit is 25 miles an hour.
Do you realize you were doing Mach 2 in a Mach 1 zone?
What to you think you got here, a rocket ship?
I don't care what century you are from, Buck; your exhaust exceeds the legal limit!
Your right tail light is out.
Do you have any idea why I pulled you over?
It' a rental -- I was bumped up to "super-size".
I expected a rocket scientist to know better.
Sir, I pulled you over for doing Mach 2 in a 30mph zone...
Did you know you were going warp 2 in a school zone?
Sir, where are your headlights?
Even if you weren't breaking the speed limit, you were thinking about it
I'm giving you this ticket because you look like you were speeding
Sorry I stopped you-- I thought you were black.
Are you aware that you have a busted tail light?
I gotcha for violating the space-time continuum in a 55mph.
The M stands for Miles, not Mach.
You're not wearing a seatbelt.
You understand that the town has a sound barrier ordinance?
I clocked you doing Mach 5 in a 25.
I’m not ticketing you for speeding. I’m ticketing you for the passive-aggressive point you’re making.
Sorry pal but the speed limit in Los Alamos is 3000 mph
Sir, did you know your tail lights have burned out?
I'm afraid that you failed to yield at the last State.
Do you know you went through a red light 280 miles back?
Next time keep it below the speed of sound.
So, you thought rear-view mirrors were an unnecessary feature.
You were doing Mach 2 in a 45 mile per hour zone.
Actually, Yes, you were speeding.
I clocked you at 635 in a 35.
Glad you ran out of fuel - this ticket should pay for the police holiday ball.
Sir, are you aware that your taillight is broken?
Sully didn't get a citation...
What kind of mileage do you get with this thing?
Your re-entry light is out.
But officer, I was just going the speed of sound.
Yeah, and I'm Spider-Man.
Well, I'm going to have to cite you for running the stop sign, but I'll let the incineration of the village slide.
Forget how fast I was going. How fast were you going in order to catch me?
So you're gonna wanna take a right in a few miles, stay on I-80 West for a while, and that should get you to the Bonneville Flats
License, registration and relative velocity.
I'm going to need your driver's license and the whole story.
And what planet did you think you were on
Your turn signals appear to be on fire.
It's my turn to bring you up to speed.
You never signaled three light years back...
Honestly Officer, I would never text and drive.
Is my brake light out?
It only looks like a squad car...
Buddy, in Mayberry nobody achieves escape velocity!
The radar gun clocked you at Mach 3 in a Mach 2 zone.
You misunderstand the concept of escape velocity.
Nice to see you again Mr. Musk.
52 in a 45. A little disappointing.
Are you aware that one of your afterburners is out?
You know you were doing Mach 2 in a Mach 1 zone?
I'm sorry, but there is no way I was going above the speed of light.
You went through a red light back in Albuquerque.
Klaatu? What kinda name's that? You a alien, boy?
Your right booster light's burnt-out.
What's the big hurry, Trump doesn't take office until next month.
The police car? Yeah, it's a hemi.
I come in peace.
Your name, address, and airport, sir.
Nope. Still Trump.
I suppose this is some sort of spatial profiling.
Sir; you're charged with DUI. Driving Under the Ionisphere.
Sorry, but a license from Uranus is not a joke here!
Do you know you were going 600 in a 35mph zone?
Your left rocket booster light is out.
Did you know you were going 17,000 mph in a 30 mph zone?
Wow, it didn't feel like I was going that fast.
I just wanted to see if your lights shifted from blue to red when I passed you.
Doing five hundred in a four-fifty zone.
A space station reprovisioning emergency, eh? You're the third guy this week with that one.
I thought that was miles per minute.
I'm writing you a ticket for the speeding, and an invoice for the radar gun you melted.
Sir, road rage is no excuse to go ballistic.
You have a broken taillight.
I'm hoping you didn't really intend to eject your passenger just then.
What's the hurry?
Sorry sir, it is against the law to text and drive.
Don't' you know this is a fly-over state?
You were going 550 in a 40 zone.
Do you know you were doing 1,200 in a 55 mph zone?
You realize you were supersonic in a subsonic zone?
You were going 50,000 in a 35 zone.
How many light-years per gallon does this thing get?
Wake up. None of this real. You are still a loser driving a beat-up Pinto.
You've got to get to a hospital on which planet?
You were going six hundred thirty-seven over.
Do I smell Romulan Ale?
Your trunk's on fire.
Well sir, it seems you were going so fast that the space/time continuum indicates I owe you money.
I could have sworn it said speed of sound, sir
That's one small trek for Rocket Man, one giant reap for the State Treasury.
I clocked you at over 186,282 miles per second, sir. You realize there's a law against going that fast?
Improper tail lights, sir.
You passed the entrance to the salt flats 10 minutes ago, about 150 miles back.
Yeah, slight problem. You were doing 17,600 in a 35.
The name's Bond. James Bond.
Officer, can you point me in the direction of the Saturn dealer?
I probably shouldn't be telling you this, but I never would've caught you.
Oh yeah? Well, this isn't space.
I've got you for a broken taillight, harmful emissions, and shattering the land-speed record.
In this town exceeding the speed of light is still regarded as breaking one of the cardinal laws of physics.
Sir, you were doing Mach 5 in a 25 MPH.
Sorry Sir, but this is flyover country.
Kid, you need to cool your jets.
Sir, I'm going to need you to step out of the penis.
Sir, I'm gonna need you to step out of the practical joke.
I need to warn you that traveling at the speed of light makes your tail lights invisible.
That won't fly around here.
Sorry ol' man, front plates are mandatory in this state.
The space race ended in 1975, buddy.
You were going so fast my father and grandfather gave you citations.
I'm writing you up for a melted tail light.
Uber or Lyft?
I don't care if you are from Alpha Centauri. I need to see your driver's license.
I said, "license and registration" bud, it's not rocket science!
Keep on moving to the next galaxy, you don't want any part of what's happening on this planet.
All right, buddy. You got problems. First, no rearview mirror.
Sir, are you aware that your right rear taillight is broken?
And will NASA be coming to give you a tow?
Okay buddy, I understand, but he doesn't take office until late January!
There seems to be a problem with your brake lights...
Your inspection sticker is a year out of date.
Sir, you were going Mach 3 in a school zone.
I'm sorry officer but I am late for my emissions test.
I'm also going to have to cite you for failure to wear a seatbelt.
License, registration and proposed trajectory.
Really, Officer? That's my fastest time!
What part of 'Sonic boom-free zone' don't you understand?
You realize you were going Warp 5 in a Warp 4 zone, doncha?
Cool your jets a minute.
I swear, Officer, the tail light was working when I left the house.
Good afternoon, do you know why I stopped you today?
I think we both know why I pulled you over.
One of your afterburners is out.
In addition to the ticket, you'll be charged for breaking the radar gun.
Because...Well...You just can't.
You have a broken taillight.
I understand that you want to leave the country before Trump is in office, but sir this is a school zone.
Any idea how fast you were going back there? Actually, I'd like to know.
Do you know how fast you were going? I'm serious. 'Cause I have no clue.
It's for a global warming infraction.
Sir, do you know your tags expired several light years ago?
Trade ya.
Are you aware that your license plate doesn't exist yet?
Where's the supernova?
I stopped you for over compensating.
Do you know how slowly time was moving?
You realize your tail light is out?
Broken tail light.
You have the right to remain arrogant.
No, I just wanted you to know that your left brake light is not working.
I understand you are rushing towards Canada but you still have to maintain speed limits.
It's illegal to break the space-time continuum in this county.
This is going to cost you more than a buck, Mr. Rogers.
Sir, are you aware that you were going 120 years ahead of the technology limit?
Nah, I just pulled you over for a broken tail light, but I do have to fine you for playing Barry Manilow on an 8-track tape player.
Mind if I take a look at your emissions certificate?
I just really need to get to Houston, asap.
The tarmac ended three miles ago, sir.
Mr. Musk... we've talked about this.
No, sir, it's "Highway 210". That's not the speed limit.
Down here I'm the sheriff.
'Sorry sir, I thought you were Black."
Is it the tail light again Officer?
Do you know why, and how, I pulled you over?
You know your right tail light's out?
Yep, you smoked the Weinermobile, but...
You need actual exhaust pipes.
I'm going to have to fine you for obvious over compensation.
Officer, I'm just trying to get to Canada before they build the wall.
Did you know your afterburner is out?
I'm not disputing you hit an asteroid, but your tail light is out.
Do you want to know in Machs?
Sorry, son, this here's a fly-over state.
Son, I'm affraid delivering a pizza under 30 minutes is not the law.
In two minutes you'll be across the state line, do YOU have any idea what the emission fines are in California?
Exactly what sort of name is "Elon"?
You were doing Mach 3 in a Mach 1 zone.
You don't want to know how fast I was going.
You can't pull a fast one on me, pal.
You've got a broken rear gimbal stabilizer.
Did you know you have a right tail light out?
No, YOU call NASA, while I run your rocket scientist license.
I've never heard of the Mach America Great Again Tour, sir
Your orbit's a little low.
Any idea?..any?.....a wild guess then.
Officer, I couldnt hear the siren!
Aw, hell's bells Mr. Musk. How many times are we gonna have to do this?
Well, if we're getting technical, you violated a traffic theory.
Great Salt Flats? Take the next left...
One of your tail lights isn't working.
I don't know, Officer. I came out of nowhere.
Officer, I'll gladly take the ticket if you can explain how you caught me.
I noticed your tail light was out.
Sounds like you have a hole in your muffler.
Seriously, a Gary Johnson bumper sticker?
If I can catch you, if I was you, I'd go back to the drawing board.
Does this look like the Utah Salt Flats to you?
No, I did not "profile" you.
Oh sorry, I thought you were black.
How long you been waiting for that tow?
While I agree your wife was getting unduly lippy with me, it was still wrong to eject her.
I bet you can’t guess why I pulled you over.
So you're from outer space and you want to meet our President... Well have I got a surprise for you!
Sir, I don't care if you are having a mid-life crisis.....
I left my registration in the future.
Yes, sir, I could see you were having a blast.
When did you realize you lost the Airstream?
It's 500 points on your license in this state for breaking the sound barrier.
I know, I'm on my way to get the side mirrors.
They're cooled, officer.
You broke my radar gun.
Just a warning, but cool your jets from now on.
Trouble taking off, Sir?
You were going .5c in a .000000089c zone
What's your hurry getting to Canada, son?
You were warping in a non-warp zone!!
Speeding? I'm still in first gear!
I'm writing a thank you note for letting me pull you over.
I started to pursue you 20 light years back.
Your tail light is out.
Your left turn signal light is fried.
In my defense, it's hard to read speed limit signs when I'm going that fast.
...and this license says 'expires 2125'...You funnin' me, son?
The M stands for Miles, not Mach.
Sir, are you aware that your tail light is out?
You failed to signal when you turned into the troposphere.
If you don't know how fast I was going I'm not going to tell you.
Sir, I pulled you over because your left tail light is broken.
Give me a break, the Star Trek convention stats in two minutes.
You were going the speed of sound in a 55.
It's $100 for speeding and $100 for singeing my eyebrows.
Son, do you know how fast you were going, because I need to write something down for your speed?
Is everything correct here, sir? Are you still living far, far away?
We have a problem. What part of no texting while driving don't you understand?
Seems like we're doing this ever Sunday now, Tom.
Was I weaving or something, Officer?
I really don't care if the fire is in Alpha Centauri.
We're actually stopping every jet travelling down this highway.
Do you know you have a busted taillight?
Okay then, here’s your concept vehicle/prototype ticket.
You've made a Mach-ery of our speed limit!
Sir, I'm running an investigation on robberies in the area, have you seen anything at all out of the ordinary tonight?
Also, your left tail light is out.
I don't mean to be difficult officer, but how can you be certain it was me?
I get the feeling you're maching me.
You were texting while driving
Officer, the EZ-Pass is in my wife's car!
So you were keeping up with the flow of traffic?
No, you're not being spatially profiled.
The good news is that you're now .001 nanoseconds younger than your exact twin...
Maybe your state allows passing over the top but here it's only on the left.
Save that relativity nonsense for the judge. Do you know how fast you were going in THIS reference frame?
Where's your front license plate?
Officer, you must understand I'm trying to move to Canada by the fastest means possible.
Try the speed of sound, wise guy.
Do you realize you were doing Mach 3 in a 45 mile per hour zone?
Well, your registration says this is a 2013 VW Jetta, but I'm going to assume that's just a DMV screw-up.
Did you not see the "Rockets Must Exit" sign?
"Breaking the sound barrier" isn't on here as an option under posted speed. I'm gonna have to let you go on a technicality.
Just wanted to warn you there's a slight turn six miles from here.
Sir, do you know what happens if you break the speed of sound?
Sir, your tail light is out-of-this-world.
35? Are you sure? I could have sworn it said 350....
Where' your seat belt?
When you see the ticket I'm writing, you might want to park this in the Smithsonian
I'm going to let you blast off with a warning this time.
Yeah, a lot of folks don't know that the new troopers can reach mach 1
License and advanced degree in aeronautical engineering, please.
Sir, are you aware that you were going Mach 5 in a 30mph zone?
I'm going to let you off with a warning, but let's try to keep it under 600.
We've had some reports of cows gittin singed. You know anythin about that?
Should I cite you for over the speed limit or under the radar?
Having trouble getting airborne, sir?
I'm pulling you over since you just violated Einstein's "Theory of Special Relativity."
Are you aware of the speed of sound in these parts?
Did you know your left tail light is out?
Just wanted to tell you that your taillights are on fire.
We have a problem?
Did you know you were going 800 miles per hour?
Your rear tail light was smoking.
One of your brake lights isn't working.
Well, officer, maybe you can suggest where the front license plate can go.
do not restart your engines until a I have time to pull around you
Uh huh, you didn't pull over because my lights looked green to you? Well that answers how fast you were going!
You failed to signal turning out of the salt flats.
Its not so bad at $10 for every mph over 60; about $99,400 should cover it.
I won't give you a ticket if you give me a ride.
Sir, 299,792,458 m/s is not only the speed limit, it's the law.
I'm sorry officer. My speedometer only measures to the nearest 100 mph.
You realize that you just coasted through that red state?
You broke my radar gun.
I said step out of the fucking rocket.
Sir, did you know your left brake light is out?
No, I stopped you for driving without a parachute.
I'll let you go with a warning but next time signal when you change altitude.
I know I was speeding. I don't know how you caught up.
Are you aware, sir, of the law that says you can't travel faster than the speed of light?
Ayup, I remember *my* first twin paradox solution, just like it was tomorrow.
I'm going to let you off with a warning this time, but don't let me catch you going over Mach 2 again.
It's not rocket science sir, your right tail light is out.
You know, the speed limit is 55 miles per *hour*.
Mach 1 in a school zone and you didn't use your right turn signal.
The sign definitely does not say 555!
Nice try, this is Bonneville Louisiana.
Sorry officer. I didn't realize I had entered a no-fly zone.
No, sir, I don't consider the relative time dilation as you approach the speed of light to be a mitigating factor.
Your tail light is broken - got any idea how dangerous that is?
We've been over this, Mrs. Musk. You still need to wear a seatbelt.
I clocked you doing Mach 7 in a Mach 5 zone.
It wasn't your speed, I saw you texting.
So just how small is it?
I'm citing you for a dangerous hood ornament.
Breaking the sound limit gets you a ticket in these parts.
Yes it is an impressive phallic symbol, Mr Weiner, but texting while driving is still a ticketable offence.
I'm sorry Officer, was I speeding?
It's refreshing to see dual exhaust on a hybrid.
I hope it was a blast.
I'm sorry sir. You can't park here.
. . .and you, sir, are no Elon Musk.
I'm letting you off with a warning this time, but get that muffler fixed pronto.
Your tail lights are burnt out
how did you catch me ?
Next time signal when you change lanes
Next time, get lost in space, not on earth.
That'll be $100 for speeding and $200 for way overcompensating.
License and country of origin
Faster than a speeding bullet is still speeding.
Ok buddy, so where's the Supernova?
Don't tell me you didn't know I was behind you, I turned on my lights and siren over two-and-a-half states ago.
You weren't on a cell-phone, were you?
License and destination, please.
I want to make sure your license says "organ donor"
Do you know why I pulled you over, Sir?
You broke the sound barrier, along with a bunch of laws.
That's very interesting about the Klingons, sir, but I still need to see your license and registration.
I don't care what they let you get away with in California, Mr. Musk.
You had a rear thruster out.
Buddy, it's the carbon footprint that troubles me most.
Sir, you were traveling at 1,345,698 mph in a 60 zone.
I stopped you because your tail lights have incinerated a few cars.
"Did you know you were going Mach 2 in a Mach 1 zone
Did you know you had a tail light out?
Could you please step out of the cockpit?
Didn't you see the 'No Sonic Booms' sign?
I pulled you over because you should really wait until the recount is over.
Your left tail light is out.
I got you going mach 4 in a 35, plus you got a tail light out.
Your tags have expired.
"Speed of sound" is still over the speed limit, sir.
Thanks for not taking off.
May I please see your pilot's license?
Do you know you went through the speed of light?
Sir, there's still some time left before Jan. 20.
You were only going 700 miles per hour, so the it-was-impossible-to-hear-the-siren excuse won't work.
You were driving under the influence of your Inner Child.
I don't know what the fine is for travelling at 8 times the speed limit, but yes, I'm pretty sure there will be points.
Well, buddy, as I think about it, flying at Mach 1 IS a good reason for not hearing my siren!
I don't care how inventive it is -- I'm citing you for a loud muffler.
Your left rear intergalactic sensor probe light is out.
I'm giving you a warning, but only because you've got such a boss ride!
You do realize he's not the actual President until January.
You were going 2,550 in a 2,500 MPH zone.
Did you know your tail lights are on fire?
I couldn't help but notice that you left your blinker on after you broke the sound barrier...
Canada's the other way.
Do you know your tail lights are out?
Next time, go a little easier on the liquid hydrogen pedal.
Wile E. Coyote called - he wants his car back.
You could be in a heap of trouble ... speeding, no license, and melting a stretch of a public road.
I'll give you a warning this time, but try to keep it under Mach 1.
Your tail light isn't working.
No, I don't know how fast you were going. Wait. That's my question, not yours.
Registration, proof of insurance and pilot's license, please.
What stop sign?
NORAD called. They're not happy.
You're under arrest for the theft of one side of Madonna's undergarment.
It's because I'm an astronaut, isn't it?
Sir, I have you going 700 in a 35.
You broke the sound barrier in a 50 mph zone.
450 in a 25 mph zone?
You do realize you were doing Mach 1 in a 35?
Did you know that one of your tail lights is busted?
Spatial profiling?
You can slow down now. You crossed into Canada fifty miles back.
Why aren't you wearing your seat belt?
NASA cut the budget again, Bob?
Sir, do you realize you failed to make a complete stop at the stratosphere?
You failed to use your turn signal... Two hundred miles ago in Albuquerque.
Speed limit hereabouts is Mach 2, sonny.
Ain't got no illegal aliens in there, do ya?
You rolled through that stop sign.
How much is the fine for breaking the sound barrier?
Not signalling, running a red light, and now I see you're not even wearing your seat belt.
This is a No Breaking Sound Barrier zone.
I Caught You Doing Warp Speed in a 55.
Hello officer I'm from Houston.
I'll bet you're wondering what's under my hood.
That was the most fun I've had in my entire life. License and registration, please?
Built for speed? You don't say.
I'm with NASA, we don't do license plates.
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time.Till touch down brings me 'round again to find I'm not the man they think I am at home. Oh, no, no, no, I'm a rocket man. Hello how are you today officer?
Okay, deal. No ticket if you drive my kid and his date to the prom in that thing.
So you're saying that you are not the man they think you are at home, oh no no no?
Your sticker's expired.
Not gonna ask you where the fire is.
You might be able to get away with this sort of thing in your galaxy, but not here buddy.
Your right afterburner is out.
No, making America great again is not a good excuse.
What's seems to be the problem officer...
I'm sorry. Rocket science is prohibited in a school zone.
Did you really say "you're no rocket scientist?"
I'm still going to need to see your license, Mr. Musk.
Are you aware both your tail lights are out?
Save the excuses. Nobody Machs me.
I'll make it a warning this time but no more sonic booms.
I really shouldn't have been able to catch you.
I can't drive 55...
It has tail lights?
Look, we all want to get out of this country as fast as possible. But you were going 17,000 miles per hour in a school zone.
It's not rocket science to know not to pass a police car in a no passing zone.
I'm heading to Canada.
You have a taillight out.
You forgot to signal.
I'm gonna let you blast off with a warning.
I pulled you over because I thought you were black, but never mind.
I hate jet setters.
Your path to glory is at odds with the road to Grandmother’s house.
But when you determined my position you couldn't have possibly clocked my momentum
I clocked you going Mach 4 in a Mach 2 speed zone.
You were doing the speed of light in a 40 mph zone.
Officer, before you say anything, I have been planning to fix that broken tail light.
That's miles per hour, not mach.
And --- lastly --- one of your tail lights is out.
Do I know how fast I was driving, Officer? Do you know how fast you had to go to catch me?
Confusing or not, the sign was for Highway 186, not the speed limit.
OK mister, let's see your pilots license
I have a lady who says you rear ended her and drove her to Pittsburgh.
I’m willing to go with a warning on the vaporized taillights, but save the breaking the sound barrier excuse for the judge.
I'm taking your license, and I think it's gonna be a long, long time.
No, officer, I don't know why you stopped me from fleeing this planet, but can you blame me?
But, Officer, I did have my lights on. I was going the speed of light so they don't work at that speed.
You broke the sound barrier and now you will have to pay to get it fixed.
Is that all you got?
No, Officer, I have no idea why you pulled me over.
I don't care if you started in Utah, this vehicle isn't street legal in Kansas.
Who knew! Uber pick-ups now go to Mars?
You don't need brake lights if you don't have brakes.
I’m going to give you a warning, but if you don’t get that afterburner fixed the next time it will be a ticket.
how did you catch me ?
Lets see your pilots license.
You have until January 20th to reach Canada buddy, you don't have to travel at the speed of sound.
No, sir, there are no illegal aliens in here.
Would you believe my wife is in the hospital?
You may be anxious to get there, but they'll tell you the same thing in Canada.
Can I have a turn?
Sir, have you taken this in for emissions testing?
Unsure of our manhood much, are we?
Keep your lizard claws where I can see them at all times!
I don't care who was elected president, you are still getting a ticket.
You were doing 5000 in a 45 mile zone.
Jetson, George Jetson.
Seat belt! Seat belt! Seat belt!
You didn’t know you were flying? What kind of rocket scientist are you?
Bring me back a few cases of Mars Bars and we'll call it even.
You blasted right through that stop sign.
Didn't you see that red planet back there?
Problem officer?
You have the right to remain... totally awesome.
Stop me if you've heard this one before.
Ok rocket man, you've got a ticket to ride, and I don'the care.
Did you know that one of your tail lights is out?
You were doing 25,000 miles per hour in a 40 m.p.h. zone.
Cape Canaveral was two exits ago.
I was going faster than the speed of what???
Officer, what do you have in that thing ??
I have to write you up. You were doing Mach 2 in a Mach 1 zone.
I clocked you going Warp 9 in a Warp 6 zone.
I'm just going to give you a warning this time, but make sure you get that tail light fixed.
Hey Bud, you really need to cool your jets.
You were doing Mach 3 in a Mach 1 county, son.
Sure, you're on an important intergalactic mission to save the universe... I've heard 'em all buddy.
When was your last emissions test?
And it looks like it's registered as a Rose Bowl float.
You really ought to get your emissions under control sir.
Sir, the Air Force denies you and your vehicle were scrambled for any reason.
I am giving you a ticket because your left tail light is out.
So what it it this time, Mr. Musk?
Yes, I know *why* you pulled me, but I don't know how.
Sir, are you aware your left tail light is out?
I pulled you over because one of your afterburners was out.
Well, Jack, have you done anything interesting since high school?
Your blood-Tang level is double the legal limit.
We don't have a ticket for suprasonic speeds. So I'll have to give you a warning.
Did you know one of your taillights is out?
Honestly, Officer, I had no idea I was going that fast.
You missed the land speed record, but your lifetime speeding tickets total qualifies for Guinness.
Do you have any idea how I caught you?
Your left thruster light is out.
Officer, I swear I'm not high anymore.
Elton John? Funny. Here's your ticket, Rocket Man.
No. I pulled you over because your taillight is out.
Are you aware that your pilot light is out?
Did you know your right taillight is out?
Did you know your right blinker is out?
Sir, there are other ways to get to Canada.
You were going to 700 in a 35 zone, but since you contributed to the Police League Christmas Fund, this is just a warning.
Did you know you were doing 1100mph in an 80mph zone?
How many tickets did you say you wanted for the Police Ball ?
Was I speeding officer ?
I was drafting, that's how.
Do you know your inspection sticker expired last month?
Did you realize you were going 10 miles past the sound barrier?
Did you know you were breaking the sound barrier in a quiet zone back there?
I don't think you realize how dangerous it is to drive around with a broken tail light.
Because I am in a good mood, I will only give you a warning for going 8,000 in a 40 mph zone, but stop with the excuse that you could not hear my sirens because you were exceeding the speed of sound
Were you aware that one of your of your taillights is out, sir?
My other car is a lunar rover.
I had you at Mach 2 on the gun.
Your brake light is out.
Well, the radar shows 999.
Rocket Man? Just the lyrics require a hefty fine , sir.
650mph in a 35mph zone is what's wrong, sir.
Do you know your back tail light is off?
Can you blame me for speeding? Gotta get out of here before Jan. 20!
I don't care if you're an astronaut. License please.
Flying a little low, weren't you?
No, this is Bonneyville, Indiana, so keep it under the speed of sound, OK?
Sorry, Pal. It's click it or ticket.
Give me a ride in this baby, and I'll tear up the ticket.
License and launch authorization, please.
I suppose you know, you were flying.
Could you cut me a break and write it up for 950 over?
You were clocked at Mach 4 in a Mach 3 Zone.
Your slipstream collapsed the billboard I was hiding behind.
Do you know your license plate has burned off ?
I usually ask "where's the fire," but I see you brought it with you.
"Your speed was fine, it's the emissions.'
Hey kid, I don't care if your dad is head of NASA, I still need to see your driver's license.
Cool your jets, this might take awhile.
Yes, I get it. 764 mph, nice world land speed record, but you didn't signal that lane change back there.
Mind if I take her for a spin?
No, you can't exceed the speed of sound on a two lane highway.
You could've mentioned the afterburn before officer Kowalski checked your tail lights.
'Need you to check that muffler.'
You know you have a burned out afterburner?
In this county, we use turn signals.
Yes, 'failure to signal' includes coming out of hyper-space.
Does this look like the Hudson River to you?
No sir. You are in Salt Lake not Salt Flats. You missed the turn 100 miles back.
Texting while driving is dangerous, son.
You can't park there.
I'll put you down for the broken taillight, and we'll ignore the Mach 2 in the 55.
What's your hurry?
Did I do something wrong, Officer?
Apologies, sir. I didn't realize you were a white male. Have a great day!
You need at least 2 passengers to drive in the HOV lane, sir...
May I have your autograph?
You need to fix that muffler right away.
So, this is just a loaner--your 747 is in the shop?
License and registration and please don't give me the usual 'I'm from another planet' excuse!
Officer: "Do you have any idea how fast you were going?" Pilot: "What year is it?"
I don't care what the speed limit is in OUTERspace, Mr. Armstrong. You're in MY space now, mister!
No rearview mirror!
You can wipe the smug look, I caught you with a Kia.
No, Officer, I have no idea why you pulled me over.
You were speeding in a no-fly zone.
You were going 806 in a school zone.
You have 24 hours to get that tail light fixed.
Do you know why I asked you to commence re-entry procedures?
Even if Mach 1 is your lowest speed, you can't do it in a school zone Mr. Musk.
I'd offer you a donut but all of mine are freeze-dried.
I'm making America HUGE again.
The next fuel station? About 10 parsecs yonder.
Then I guess we both set a land-speed record.
Seriously... How small is it?
Here's your ticket. Mind my asking what kind of mileage she gets?
Before I give you a ticket, does this thing have a cup-holder?
That's some fast patrol car you've got there officer.
A vehicle matching this description has been reported smuggling aliens into the country. Know anything about it?
Sorry, but I have to give you a warning for not wearing a seatbelt.
Are you machin' me boy?
What's the officer, problem?
I don't care if your name is George Jetson.License and registration please!
I'm gonna give you a warning this time, but you gotta get your "Lift-off" switch fixed.
When you broke the sound barrier, ten cows keeled over. Plus, the brake light is out on your left Turbo Blaster.
How many time zones per gallon do you get with this thing?
No, escape velocity is not within the legal limit.
Do you realize you were about mach three over the speed limit?
I'm sorry but around here we frown upon incinerating tailgaters.
You really should re-think this one, Mr. Musk.
Our cruisers have more punch than the public assumes.
Yes, I saw the 'Student Driver' bumper sticker...
You were 500 mph over the limit. That'll be ..... $2,000,000 fine. Slow down. Have a nice day.
guess you didn't see that City back there
I clocked you at just under escape velocity.
I flagged you 200 miles back...
Do you know how fast you were compensating, sir?
Do you know why I pulled you over, Mr. Branson?
What do you mean I broke the sound barrier?! I sure as hell didn't hear it.
Actually you just have a taillight out.
Did you know that you were driving without a right turbothruster?
You may be wondering why I pulled you over.
Aren't you a little off the beaten flight path?
Have you been high today?
please don't tell my father
This is America. It's 2017. Donald Trump is president.
Who do you think you are, John Glenn?
I don't care if your Tesla is in the shop, this vehicle is not street legal Mr. Musk.
Son, it looks like you need directions. I'd suggest "vertical" rather than "horizontal".
Well, you're not on Mars now, rocket boy, tell it to the judge.
Why? Because I clocked you at 2,500 MPH in a school zone.
Sir, have you been smoking marijuana today? The launch was cancelled six hours ago.
No problem at all. Just checking to see if you're from these parts.
You're gonna wanna get that taillight fixed.
Excuse me officer, but this loaner is all NASA would give me
Your lunar module light's out.
Could we hurry this along? I'm on my launch hour.
Did you know you took that turn at Mach .028
Officer, I really am Neil Armstrong.
You were going the speed of sound in a 55.
Houston, we have a moving violation.
Ground control to Major Tom.
Do you have any idea how high you were going?
I had you doing 15,620 in a 65.
Speeding? Office, I didn't hear your siren as I was going faster than the speed of sound!
Sir, you were doing 1,550 in a 55.
No sir, I do not know if a citation is valid proof for a world record.
I'm sorry to inform you that your license plate has melted.
You were doing Mach 4 in a 55 zone.
Your license and registration, Mr. Leno.
You're in violation of Vehicle Code 34301.1(e): Igniting Afterburners in a School Zone
You weren't speeding, I just needed a story for the precinct.
500 in a 50. And yes, that is a moving violation.
Nope, nobody's ever told me I have beautiful eyes.
Ever heard of a runway?
Where do you think you're going so fast, the moon?
Could I see your registration and pilot's license, please?
Your left tail light is on fire.
Your left rear light is out.
But my friend at NASA promised me it's street legal.
Were you aware, Ma'am, that you were going 350 miles over the speed limit?
No this is 2016 and yes we still issue paper tickets, but you can pay online!
Driver's liscense, registration and patent number, please.
...and your seat belt isn't fastened.
Where's the supernova?
Did you know your left turn signal is out?
Do you know you have a rear taillight out?
Please step out of the jet.
.......Slow enough for you to catch me.
So where's the moon launch?
Your speeding was one thing; the tailgating was beyond the pale
But Officer, I wasn't texting.
Sir you have a tail light out
I'm going to let you off with a warning for the 25,000 miles per hour in a 55 Zone, but is that a cell phone on your lap?
Sir,you reentered through two stop signs.
Nice try McFly!
In hindsight, I should've stolen a car with a less conspicuous color.
Do you know that your right rear light is out?
No, I don't believe your excuse for being late for the science fair.
This is the third time this week.
Mach 4 in a Mach 2 zone.
Any idea how fast you were going?
You failed to come to a complete stop at Mars.
Is this not advertised as Big Sky Country?
Really, Elon?
I'm letting the dark tail-light go, but I have to write you up for the broken muffler.
The first ticket is for breaking the speed limit and--since this is a quiet zone--the second ticket is for breaking the sound barrier.
Call me Captain Kirk one more time and I'll beam you up.
you know why I stopped you sir?
I am just going to assume that there is no catalytic converter on this thing right?
I'm only giving you a warning because you've been polite and have a reasonable explanation. However, you'll have to make restitution to local ranchers for burning their cows.
Did you know your recovery parachute light was out?
You rolled the stop sign back there.
What's the rush Rocket Man?
I clocked you at 10 to the 5th over the speed limit but since this is your first offense, I'm going to write you up for only 5 over.
Sure, Einstein may say the faster you go the slower you age - but I say here's your ticket and crap to him!
You failed to come to a complete stop.
What?
Today's your lucky day. No way is the judge going to believe my speeding ticket, so I'm citing you for the last 9 stop signs you failed to come to a full stop at.
Honest, I put the breaks on three miles ago.
You need a new muffler
I never thought you'd catch me.
Congratulations, sir, you have just won the traffic ticket trifecta. Speeding at 784 mph, 729 miles over the speed limit; breaking the sound barrier in violation of our local noise ordinance; and, of course, no inspection ticket.
There's no right on red planet.
That fast, huh?
Sir, you're too spaced out to be driving.
My dad's going to kill me
You need to show me a space ship license, an air plane license, and a driver's license.
Officer, could you make this quick? I am obviously in a hurry.
VW recalled this model last week for excessive emissions.
I was activating the flex capacitor, not texting.
You know you were breaking the sound barrier back there, don't you?
Why'd I pull you over? Because you were going Mach 2 in a 35 miles per hour zone, that's why.
Do you really think I am going to believe that story?
I'm not falling for the 'need to escape earth's gravitational field' excuse again
You failed to come to a complete stop upon reentry into the Earth's atmosphere.
I swear. I wasn't going faster than the speed of sound.
Your midlife crisis sticker is expired.
I was just kidding about your taillight being out. You were speeding.
Ha! You actually think I have a license and registration for this thing?
You've got a tail light out... and I clocked you at Mach 1.
I clocked you going warp 2 through a school zone back there.
The fin is so retro.
Land speed record, no. Busted tail light, yes.
Do you know you have faulty exhaust pipes?
Officer, it's self driving!
Don't you realize it's against the law to disconnect, modify or alter a required pollution control device?
Really, officer? I could have sworn I was only doing 32,000mph.
Sir ... are you aware you have a broken tail light?
I guess you didn't see the Mars exit 3 miles back.
I'm sure it's an honest mistake, but the limit's 55, not 550.
This is a no sonic boom zone.
You've got a tail light out.
Elon who?
Just this once, I'm letting you off with a warning.
Your drivers license expires 3 light years ago, Captain Kirk.
Do you have any idea how many barriers you just broke?
Do you know your tail lights are out?
So, you're telling me speed traps are rigged?
That'll be six million, 525 thousand dollars, please.
Do you know your brake lights are not working?
Rocket License and Registration, please.
You were going 40 in a 35.
You know, I never noticed the signs don't have a unit of measurement.
Twelve.
Both your tail lights are burned out
Yes, its quite impressive but that's not why I pulled you over
I'm sorry, officer. The light looked blue to me.
Well, Mr. McFly, you are in the future. License and Registration, please.
I'd give you a ticket - but I'm feeling inadequate
No, it's electric, sir. The smoke is just for decoration.
Did you realize you were going 356,701,589 miles an hour?
But Officer, what's a stop sign?
No, Mr. Armstrong, it doesn't matter that it's your company car.
Besides your afterburners, where's the fire, buddy?
You were doing the speed of sound in a 55 ... and your tail light's out.
You have any clue on why I pulled you over?
You have a busted tail light.
License and flight insurance, please.
Did you notice you passed 45 stoplights?
Yeah? Well, around here, buddy, we got a little thing we call 'The Speed of Light,' and we take it kind of serious.
Please don't tell my dad, it's his company car.
No rearview mirror!
Sir, your left tail light is out.
The speed limit is 25 MPH, and you were doing Warp Factor 9.
Did you know your rear thruster light is out? .
Were you aware that your tail light is out?
You need to replace your muffler.
Are you familiar with the sound barrier laws in this state?
Do you know how fast you were time traveling?
What do you mean you only have a learners permit.
I'm going to let you off with a warning.
Well fella, this is a warning ticket...your tail lights are out!
You were going 1000 miles an hour in a 55 zone, but that's not why I pulled you over.
I appreciate your slowing to 325 in the school zone, but still.
Did you know that you were going 485 mph in a 30 mph zone?
While not brain surgery, using turn signals apparently outstrips rocket science.
Are you aware that your brake lights are completely burned out?
Did you know your taillights melted?
Sammy, 'I Can't Drive 55' isn't a valid excuse.
Officer, I was just keeping up with traffic!
It's not your taillights. Your afterburners are out.
It's not rocket science.
Did you know you were missing a tail light?
Firing your left afterburner does not constitute signaling a proper lane-change.
You match the description of a vehicle seen driving slowly past houses and looking into peoples' garages.
License, registration and penis.
One of your tail lights is burned out.
I have to tell you, this ticket is going to be "huuuge".
Sir, do you know when you are?
When you left that last light you melted two Telsas and one Prius, which I personally think is pretty cool.
You were ten miles over the sound barrier.
Can I see your registration and pilot license?
Your right afterburner is out.
You have a broken drag chute light.
You were traveling the speed of sound in a 55-miles-per-hour zone.
let me guess,... you have an early launch window and your running late?
Can you just give me a warning? My Dad is going to kill me if he finds out I took out his rocket car.
Sir, are you aware your rear left O ring is broken?
We all want to age more slowly. But I am still gonna have to give you a ticket.
Elton John?
The boys at Emissions Testing are going to have fun with you.
Pilot's licence please.
I stopped you because of the burned-out headlights—mine.
Sir, your taillight is out.
You were doing Mach 1.25 in a Mach 1.0 speed zone.
Sorry, officer, it's not really designed to be stepped out of.
Must be pain to parallel park that thing
You were speeding.
Sir, are you aware that you have a broken tail light?
What do you mean " my speed was out of this world"??
Yes, because you were speeding -- but pretty much just jealousy.
This is a no fly zone. Didn't you see the sign?
How did I catch you? Let's start with the fact that you get one-half mile per gallon in this thing.
I'm going to let you go this time but keep it under 9,500 mph
You broke my radar.
This is the last warning you will get Mr. Smith. It is NOT necessary to count backwards from ten after the light turns green.
Say, we don't see many of these around these parts.
This is a non-smoking road.
I dont care you're pedaling, it looks way too fast.
Let's see, $250 for every five miles over the speed limit. That'll be a cool ten million.
I clocked you at warp factor six and you want me to give you a warning?.
you were doing 500 MPH in a 45 MPH. I'll let you off with a warning this time.
You know your tail light's out?
Mr. Musk, please step out of your rocket ship.
You are over compensating
Oh, it's you Elon. Look, you're still going to have to cool your jets.
Your right tail light is out.
You know your left-turn signal has been on since the salt flats.
Huston, we have a problem
Want to guess why I pulled you over?
Your left turn signal is out.
5,080 in a 45 mph zone-really?!
I don't care if it's a limited edition.
Your brake light is out.
Sorry Bud, but don't even thin about callin this spacial profiling!
Sorry Officer, but I was going too fast to read the speed limit signs.
It's one planet to the east.
My wife has gone into labor on Mars.
I don't care that you need to get to Canada right away.
You paid too much if I can overtake you.
Just checking your seatbelt
Do you realize you have a damaged tail light?
I guess sky is not the limit.
You seem to be confusing your businesses, Mr. Musk.
I haven't given a ticket for a defective muffler in a long time.
Well, well, well, fifth loaner from the Saturn Dealer today, without a valid sticker!
I need to see proof that you've done your emissions test.
650 mph in a 55 mph zone, tsk tsk tsk
Tell you what. You give me a valid reason for doing over 400 mph in a 55 mph zone and I'll write you a warning instead of a ticket.
I've been trying to catch you for at least the last stage.
About those tail lights.....
The reason I stopped you is your back right taillight is out.
"Flyover country" is an offensive term, sir.
You didn't stop at that stop sign 186,282 miles back.
No, it was the no right on red that got you.
How did I guess you voted for Trump?
Canada's not far enough, huh?
You were in the HOV lane without a passenger.
I'm exhausted.
88's not fast enough for you anymore, Marty?
It's Route 478, not the speed limit.
I don't care if it only has one seat, you still can't use in the HOV lane.
I don't care if it's the new Tesla, you're still getting a ticket.
Exceeding the speed of light in an Einsteinian Universe...
Sir, are you aware you sped right through that event horizon?
You're making a Mach-ery of the speed limit, you know.
May I see your pilot's license?
110, you're kidding.
No, I 'm not getting smart with you...there really isn't anything under the hood!
I only stopped you to inquire where I could possibly get one of these myself
If Elon jumped off a cliff, would you do it too?
I'm going to let you off with a warning this time. Let's try to keep it under the sound barrier, shall we?
For the records, do you know how fast you were going?
Officer, it's actually just a fiberglass body over a volkswagen chassis.
Is there some reason you were going 300 miles an hour over the limit?
You got a busted left tail light.
What's the problem, officer?
Okay, buddy. Just how much testosterone have we had today?
Sir, please step out of the rocket. I smell alcohol so I am going to cite you for a RUI.
Sorry, Houston, but we have a problem. Please step out of the rocket.
Are you aware that your left blinker is out?
And, you need a new muffler.
Did you know your tail lights are burned out?
Do you have any idea how fast I was going?
Someone reported that you were black.
You're missing your front license plate.
One of your brake lights is out.
My partner says it's a '58, I say 59'.
Any idea how fast you were going?
All right, where's the Supernova?
Sir, have you been drinking?
you'all gotta cool your jets round these parts
You have a message from NASA ... quote...Mars is closer if you aim at the sky.......unquote
Sir, do you know how fast you were going? I'm having trouble with the Relativistic calculations.
Cool your jets buddy, I just asked a question.
What's in the bottle on the floor? Romulan Ale?
I'm more of a Billy Joel man.
Your back left tail light is out!
Nope, just a broken tail light.
You have a broken tail light, sir.
Sir, tricycles must stay in the bike lane.
I'm writing you up for going 700 mph over the speed limit, disturbing the peace with a sonic boom, and failing to properly display a front license plate.
Can you prove this to be your vehicle sir? We've had a number of thefts in the area...
Can I have a ride?
It's a fine for speeding without a parachute.
Really, that fast?
And your left brake light is out.
I can call AAA but I think it's gonna be a long, long time.
You were doing warp speed in a Mach 1 zone.
Nice toy you stole, but NASA wants it back.
Your blinker's been out for the last eighty million miles.
Your left tail light is out. This is a warning.
No, son, not 'attitude.' Altitude.
Well, Mr. Heisenberg, then do you know exactly where you are?
2.60776 times 10 to the negative 13th parsecs over the speed limit, to be exact.
I clocked you going zoom in a whoosh zone.
Runs on alfalfa? You don't say!
But I don't need brake lights, officer. I don't use brakes.
So, let's go through that again..your tail light broke when you re-entered our atmosphere?
I'm relatively certain I wasn't speeding.
Okay, Rocketman, where's the fire; and not the one behind you
"360 in a 25 mile per hour zone. Are you trying to set a record? Besides, you owe me for the windshield you melted.
Did you know you were doing speed-of-sound in a 25?
Do you realize that your driver side tail light is out?
Are you aware you were doing 187mph in a 55mph zone?
Mr. Musk, do you know why I stopped you?
Rocketing while intoxicated is taken very seriously here in Jupiter, Florida.
You were doing 200 in a school zone. You better let Houston know you've got a real problem.
Your tail lights have burned out.
Are you Elton John?
Don't tell me you didn't realize how fast you were going.
You realize you were going 10 miles over Mach 1
Ironically, you were going under the speed limit.
I'd guess you have really, really small hands?
I noticed you weren't wearing your ejection seat helmet there pal!
Honestly officer, I couldn't have been speeding. I had it set to 60 on cruise missile control.
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that you were speeding.
Tail light's out.
No seatbelt, we ticket!
We had a report of a science education being used in the area.
You realize that you were exceeding the space time continuum theory by 5 miles per hour don't you?
Did you see the 35 mile per hour sign back there?
I must not have been going that fast. You caught me.
I'll do you a favor and write you up for only doing 150 in a 35 mph zone
They told me I could pick any car in the lot.
I don't suppose you know why I pulled you over...
You have any idea how fast you were going?
So how do I explain my melted radar gun to the chief?
The posted speed limit sign is in miles per hour not miles per second. Either way it's melted now.
Were you aware that you broke the sound barrier back there?
I had you at Mach 10 in a Mach 2 zone.
License and immigration, please.
Well, touch down is bringing you around to find a $400 fine and 5 points on your license, Rocket Man...
This ticket is for going past the speed of light.
Well, maybe on your planet but here we call it speeding!
Sir, if you're going to drive under the speed limit you have to stay in the right lane
I heard the divorce went well.
Normally I'd say 'Where's the fire?', but it just melted my dashboard.
Looks like exhaust to me; where's your inspection sticker?
I need to see your drivers license AND your pilot's license...
You have burned out tail-lights.
Is there a problem, officer? The sign said no pedestrians, bicyclists or equestrians.
No, officer, I do not know the fine for going 900 miles per hour over the speed limit.
Well, smarty pants, on Earth, M.P.H. doesn't mean meteors per hour.
Officer, it actually just has a 1970 AMC Gremlin engine.
Your tail light destroyed six farms.
Excuse me, sir, were you aware that you were doing light-speed in a 25?
Please put your small hands on the steering wheel, sir.
"Are you from around here?
You didn't come to a complete stop at the Crab Nebula.
You passed through your midlife crisis a few warp years back, sir.
Your wife is about to give birth on Mars--that's a new one.
Your brake light is out, sir.
There's no point taking the high road now, sir.
Broken tail light.
You were doing 350 in a 20.
I noticed that you have a broken afterburner.
Sir, do you know why I stopped you?
Von Braun? Are you related to the Greenville von Brauns?
Didn't you see that stop sign back there?
You are receiving two citations: 1) excessive afterburner use, and 2) playing Elton John's 'Rocket Man' in a hospital Quiet Zone. Any questions?
You'd like to 'Apollo-gize?'
That will be a ticket for $175 and 20,000,000 points for speeding.
Issuing you this speeding ticket covers my quota for the year.
Your brake lights are out.
Mind if we switch for a little while?
"No, you weren't speeding, I'm arresting you for being incredibly annoying.''
It's beta.
Because you were doing Mach 1 in a 55 mile an hour zone.
You know that your tail lights are burnt out?
…and no seat belts.
Sir, the fine for not wearing a seatbelt is thirty dollars.
How fast can you get me to the nearest coffee shop?
I'll have to give you a ticket, sir. You were travelling faster than the speed of light.
You do realize that your brake lights aren't working right?
Got you going 22 in a school zone.
What helmet law?
I'm going to give you a warning for doing 650 in a 35, but I have to issue you a citation for the expired plates.
I can understand you're under a lot of stress but with all due respect, what kind of idiot takes a delivery job with the only Domino's Pizza within a 200 mile radius?
Congradulations! You just set the land speed record in a school zone.
Slow down. You move too fast. You've got to make the morning last.
Did you know you were going 10,348 miles per hour over the speed limit?
I have to write you up for not having a vanity plate.
Did you know your engine was on fire?
Well, buddy, whether you knew it or not, your taillight's out.
No, I'm citing you because your right brake light is out. I'll be darned if I'll give you the satisfaction of a speeding ticket.
The alien defense won't work, son. This ain't Arizona.
But Officer, I was trying to get out of here before the presidential nightmare becomes a reality!
Jetson-Schmetson, you're getting a ticket.
Yes, I'm aware the speed of sound is slower than the speed of light.
I admire the space program as much as the next guy, but you can't to do 220 in a 45.
Sorry officer, it was just a case of failure to launch.
I clocked you at 672 miles per hour, but I'm going to write the ticket for 664.
It passed state inspection, except for the emissions test.
A bit heavy on the afterburner pedal are we not, General Yeager?
I pulled you over because your right o-ring is burned out.
Speeding? No. Your left brake light is out.
I'll let you off with warning. Just keep it to 555.
Did you think you could get away with disabling your catalytic converter?
No officer, it's a Dyson.
Your tail lights are, um, burned out.
Exceeding the speed of light is against the law.
Very fancy combine, sir, but it still needs a Slow Moving Vehicle emblem.
Speeding? No, your taillight is out.
I stopped you for over compensating.
Next time, I'd go for less conspicuous.
I've been following you since you left Venus and you definitely were speeding!
Why? For going 200 in a school zone and taking seventeen miles to pull over, that's why.
At that speed, Sir, you weren't driving this vehicle. You were aiming it!
I don't care if your name is Sully.
Give me a current license, son. This one's no good before twenty fifty-one.
I'm not going to write you up today, but I want that flux capacitor fixed by Thursday.
No, it hasn't expired. This license doesn't become valid until 2030.
Show me your license, registration, and proof of life insurance.
Huston, we have a problem
You never get the mileage they print on the window sticker...
Mr. Musk, I'm going to have to ask you to step out of the vehicle.
Good thing you ran out of fuel - it was getting pretty hot back there.
Do you know why I pulled you over this evening, sir ?
Only 863 miles to Canada? Slide over, I'm coming along!
Drunk, naked and crashing an MiG is no way to go through life, son.
I don't care what you read on the internet, the speed limit has not been abolished.
My wife told me not to come home until I got bigger test vehicles
I pulled you over because I can.
Stick to the interstate highways next time
Sir, I regret to inform you that in this state we obey the laws of thermodynamics.
Sir, the salt flats are in Utah, not Indiana.
I know, your speedometer isn't working, right?
Sir, have you been drinking? Or have I?
Says here your Burning Man mutant vehicle permit has expired, sir.
So you're telling me you built this for the soap box derby...
I clocked you at 25 in a 55 MPH zone.
"...and where can Jane, Judy or Elroy be reached, sir?
You're left rear tail light is out.
Your sonic boom has you doing at least 761 mile per hour, but I'll only put you down for 699.
It's because I'm white, right?
I clocked you at "Mach 1"!
No, you were not "moving with traffic".
Sure, sure, I know, pal -- you didn't see the signs.
Let me guess, Mr. Breedlove, your parachute and brakes failed.
Got room for one more?
License and passport please.
Your right rear tail light is out.
Because you were driving below the minimum posted speed.
Your sonic booms tells me you were going at least 761 miles per hour, but I'll put you down for 699.
You have a clean record, so I'm just gonna cite you for an obscured license plate.
Sign this, and try to keep it under Mach 1.
If you had deployed your 'chute, you'd still be on the salt flats. License and registration, please.
I know how you're feeling, but Mars isn't the answer.
You been getting high sir?
And your tail lights are burned out.
But how's the gas mileage?
... and this one is for the three passenger cars and the small truck you set ablaze at that intersection.
Boy, you wasn't driving too fast. You was flying too low!
Your left taillight isn't working.
The wife won't let me drive mine.
Just out of curiosity, does it burn regular or premium?
Gas is so cheap these days I thought "why not?"
You were going Mach 2 in a school zone.
So, Armstrong. It's you again!
Yeah, and I go where quite a few have gone before.
Son, I've been waiting for a speed demon like you for 20 years, now." "Well, Officer, I got here as fast as I could.
I had you at 620 in a 65 zone
Yeah, well my cruiser had no trouble catching you, Mr. Supersonic
It's not a speeding violation. It's an offense against good taste.
A thousand points! I thought the maximum for speeding was three?
Do you have a license to be compensating for something so big.
I must have left the registration at the Space Station
So, where's the super nova?
Put your clothes back on and let's talk.
Sorry, time dilation is no excuse for an expired registration.
To be honest Mr. Musk, combining your passions probably wasn't the best idea.
I pulled you over because you were doing 16.26 kilometers a second in a 55 mile an hour zone.
Your driving's like nothing on earth.
You’re obstructing traffic no matter how hard you’re pedaling.
Traveling from the future to prevent oncoming apocalypse is not a viable excuse for speeding, sir.
I'm sorry, sir, your Krypton driver's licence isn't legal in Minnesota.
Betcha didn't think I'd catch ya.
Elon, this is your fifth ticket this week!
I clocked you going 30 mph over the sound barrier.
So, what kinda gas mileage you get in this thing?
Are you aware it's illegal to have a nipple on display in this state?
Sorry, but tricycles are not permitted on this highway.
Do you know you have a tail light out?
Officer, I would get out, but my pants are wet.
Oops, sorry to stop you. I didn't notice you are white.
No, I'm citing you for failure to display corporate sponsorship.
You're rushing off to Canada following the election? Tell it to the judge.
Sir, I pulled you over because you failed to lift off.
No, you can't borrow my radar gun.
Officer, honestly I was live streaming not texting.
Your rocket is fine, the red glare is coming from my cruiser.
Where's the solar flare?
On your way to Canada, you say?
Nah. Broken tail light.
I understand you blew through a red light in Herzegovina a few minutes ago.
Actually no, your tags are just out of date.
Wanna trade?
License and NSA registration please.
'I'm not the man I used to be at all, oh no no no'
I was just trying to get off the ground.
Sir, you were going 17,000 miles per hour in a 50 miles per hour zone.
Seriously officer ? This is Wisconsin?
Sir, do you know how fast you were compensating?
Broken tail-lamp.
Did you know you were doing 10 miles per hour over the sound barrier.
Your right taillight is busted--and you were doing 621 miles an hour.
And just how fast do you THINK you were going?
You aren't wearing your seatbelt.
Are you aware you were breaking the sound barrier?
Don't waste your one call to Houston.
I thought you would be Jay Leno.
Visa and Alien registration application Please
You saw me then you buckled your seat belt.
You understand that deregulation of the speed limit doesn't occur until after the presidential inauguration?
Officer would you mind putting this on my permanent record?
Affluenza is not an excuse.
Mars, huh? Is that the kind of place to raise your kids?
Listen smart guy. I'll show you some Right Stuff right now!
Your astronaut license and registration, please.
I didn't want to be late for the launch.
Why exactly were you tailgating that balloon truck?
It actually wasn’t just that light back there: you haven’t stopped for anything in about a thousand miles.
You are not OK for lift off.
Sir, are you aware that you have a tail light out?
If you can't keep up with the traffic, move to the right lane.
Mr Musk, Mars is up, not across.
Just get that taillight fixed next time, OK buddy?
Your registration expired.
I'm trying to get to Canada as soon as possible.
Okay, son, just keep it under 800.
Sir, did you realise both your tail-lights are out?
I'm just surprised I caught up to you.
Speed limits are not rocket science, sir.
Congratulations, you just set the land speeding record.
Ok, where's the firefight?
You were going 500 mph in a 400 mph zone.
Sir you were going 500 miles per hour in a 25 mile per hour zone
You can't do Mach 1 in a 30 m.p.h. zone.
Did you know your left afterburner is wonky?
Turn down the radio please.
License and registration in 3, 2, 1….
So this is the new Tesla!
I clocked you doing Mach 2 in a Mach 1 zone. I'm afraid I'm going to have to write you up.
Mach 10 is not the posted speed limit, sir.
Sorry son, but bitcoin isn't a payment option.
Are you aware you were going Mach 2 in a 55 mph zone?
It's posted, sir: no afterburners.
What's the fine for 15 hundred over?
Sorry, officer, there is no glove compartment. My registration and smog certificate are on file with NASA.
Did you know you have no working taillights?
Oh, c'mon, you KNOW where the fire is
One of your tail lights is out.
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that you were speeding
Did you realize you forgot to signal back there?
The exit for JPL was about two parsecs back.
Failure to signal a galaxy change.
The speed limit in this town is Sound.
Sir, do you know what the land speed record is?
Just turn around and follow me to the station.
Geez Max, and I thought you were a show-off in high school...
This is for being the sole occupant using the HOV lane
For not wearing a helmet.
Dude, where's your car?
You're messing with me. Right?
Speeding? No, this ticket is for the broken tail light.
This is my first ticket for someone passing OVER me!
Sir, your left blinker is broken.
Where's the fire-- on Mars?
You know this would be different if you were black.
You were going under the speed limit for this vehicle.
Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to eject yourself from the rocket-shark
Yeager, hmm....any relation to Chuck?
this is your second warning to cool your jets
Sir, do you realize you were going 1,340 in a 35 mph zone?
You guys always go for out of state plates, huh?
Thanks for pulling over.
I'm giving you a ticket for driving too slow.
No, I'm Jerry Jetson, George's older brother.
You know better than to break Mach 4.
Did you know one of your taillights is out?
Any idea how much faster than the speed of sound you were going?
sir i pulled you over because this is a no fly zone.
Do you know what Mach number you were going?
But Officer, I couldn't hear your siren, I had broken the speed of sound!
You can't go faster than my radar gun. It's the law ... of physics.
But officer, 120 is the new 60.
I clocked you doing 2800 in a 55 mile per hour zone.
I've warned you before about that broken tail light.
Actually, I know precisely how fast I was going.
Yeah, I'd say it is running a little hot.
Son, the error code on my radar gun, in the owners manual it translates to "arrest him".
No , you are flying too low...
No texting!
Your tail light's busted
You were going just a bit over the speed limit.
How fast does snapchat say that you were going?
Please turn off your engines, I can't hear you.
We're serious about the seat belt law in this state buddy
I couldn't get it up.
Uber or Lyft?
No, I'm afraid it's miles per hour, not mach per hour.
Sorry, sir, but there is a minimum speed of 40 m.p.h. on this road.
You were in the HOV lane.
Your tail lights are too bright.
I clocked you at Mach I in a 25 MPH zone.
Third one of these I've pulled over this week.
Sorry officer... I just pulled over to safely take a call. High tech ride but no blue tooth.
Do you realize you're missing back left heat shield?
Your brake lights are out.
You know, you're the third joy-riding valet I've pulled over this week.
Orbital velocities won't get you very far. Just sayin'.
Actually, I don't want to know.
License and physics, please.
Master's degree and registration please.
I don't care if your father is going to be president, you can't drive a jet on the highway.
Sound barrier or not, your tail light is out.
Sorry. This time, you just got too high.
I'll get that tail light fixed right away, Officer.
Young man, you were not only exceeding the speed limit, you were exceeding the speed of sound. License and registration, please.
Was it my taillight, officer?
That's an illegal tint.
Mr. Musk, I'm sorry but I do not know who you are.
I'm sorry Sir, no three wheeled vehicles are allowed on this highway!
I got it. Spread your wings. Take it to the limit. Eschew the quotidian. Last check on the bucket list. Attain the sublime thrill of visceral epiphany... I still gotta give you a ticket.
You were going Mach 2 in a Mach .05 zone.
Naw, that's cool. You left tail light is out.
I'm letting you off with a warning this time. But if I catch you texting again, I'm writing you up.
You expect me to believe you thought the speed limit sign said 65 THOUSAND miles/hr?
License, registration, and Orbital Mechanics degree, please.
And just who did you expect to repair the melted asphalt?
600 in a 40 zone ... you were flying!
I don't care what your GPS says, this isn't the way to Mars.
I clocked you at 437 miles per hour over the posted limit... and I noticed your left turn signal is out.
In a hurry to get somewhere?
Well, if it were a weapon, there wouldn't be any problem. But since this doohickey is on wheels, I'm afraid I'm going to have to see your license and registration.
I'm obliged to ask,- have you been drinking?
I don't have a calculator so you're getting a warning.
Found the dog leash tied to the bumper. Poor little guy, probably kept up with you for a mile or so.
Do you realize that was a Mach 2 school zone, sir?
Your smog check sticker expired.
I know you were at least over MACH 1
Pilot's license and aircraft registration, please.
I'll need to see your license, registration and smog check certificate.
I clocked you going 2000 miles above the speed limit.
Sir, did you know that you were going Mach 3 in a Mach 2 zone?
Did you think it was a blue light?
Cool your jets, you've been signaling since Venus
On top of which you're facing the wrong way!
Canada?
Choosing a non-red model did not help Greg stay inconspicuous on the road.
Did you know your rear burners were out?
Sir, do you know how slow you were going?
I won't arrest you if you can hook me up with the guy you bought that from.
You didn't yield for the International Space Station at 200,000 feet and it had the right of way.
I'll let you off with just a warning this time, but get that muffler repaired!
Your rear thrust light is out.
You'll need an emissions test sticker.
Please tell me you were only reaching for your registration just then and that you didn't intend to eject your wife.
Yeah, yeah, and I suppose you're wearing Speedo shorts, too.
For the Kennedy Space Center take a right at the next traffic light.
But officer, I hardly touched the accelerator!
Emergency landing? What type of a speeding excuse is that!?
Because you failed to signal your descent.
You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out you were speeding.
Sir, are you aware your tail light is out?
Yes there is no speed limit, but I heard you!
No, the B-2 evades radar. You have the B-3.
Mach 4 in a 35.
Can you tell me where the Bonneville salt flats are?
Sir. Didn't you see the No Afterburner" sign back there?
And fix your mufflers, will you?
Do you know why I grounded you?
Your left turn signal isn't working.
For doing mach 3 in a 50 mile-an-hour zone, that's why.
Sorry, sir, whether it is Mach three or four, it is hazardous to drive with a broken tailight.
Sir, do you know what warp you were going?
What wife? What baby? What hospital?
You can go ahead and tweet as much as you want that I'm an idiot Mr.Trump, but I suggest that you focus instead on trying to learn how to drive something with this much power.
I don't care if you're late for a meeting - do you have any idea what the fines are for going 765 over the speed limit?
Your left afterburner is out.
Where did you learn to drive, Mars?
I'm giving you two tickets for going twice the speed of sound
So you've just broken the world speed record? Tell me something I don't know.
Son, the fact of the matter is your taillights are burned out
But officer, it was the slowest I could go.
I stopped you because you were doing the speed limit.
The "I was just keeping pace with the flow of traffic" argument doesn't actually apply to AIR traffic....
I don't care if you were "only" going Mach .039.
No, contrary to what you may have read online this thing is NOT protected by the 2nd Amendment.
You lost your front license plate
“You may consider yourself above the law but I’m going to bring you down to earth.
I'm letting you off with a warning, but get that tint removed.
Seriously, THAT much over the limit?
Don't tell me. A volkswagen passed you and said he couldn't get out of 2nd gear.
No, we don't recognize license plates from Pluto.
I had you clocked at 800 miles above speed limit.
No ma'am. The supersonic zone ended several miles back.
I'm sorry Mr. President-Elect, but our state road safety laws do apply to you. Now, please give me your birth certificate.
You're in a no afterburner zone.
Did you know that your brake light is not working?
I'm afraid that tic tac can't help you now.
Now remember to get that tail light fixed soon.
Do you know how many times over the speed of sound you were going?
I'm sorry sir, but rockets haven't been cool since the '56 Chevy.
Do you know how fast you should have been going?
Sir, your turn signals are smoking.
I got you going Mach 3 in a Mach 2 zone.
You understand, of course, that the raison d'être of my vehicle is to break barriers.
And is your first name pronounced Ee-lon or Ay-lon, Mr. Musk?
I don't care if a light year is a unit of distance, not speed. You were going too fast.
Would you believe I'm on my way to DMV?
Sir, are you aware that your afterburner light is broken?
That's all well and good, son. But in this county you need to signal before an afterburn.
Never mind me, how fast were you going?
Is this the road to the salt flats?
Well yeah, the problem is the speed limit. But my name ain't Houston?
I'll be glad to give you directions to the Bonneville Salt Flats. I'll also be glad to give you a ticket.
Thank you for becoming our top donor.
It's illegal to drive without running lights, especially so at 450 miles per hour.
Your left turn light is on and it's driving everybody crazy.
You're in the HOV lane. Anyone else in there?
This is a no-mach speed zone.
Sorry, Officer. I was listening to NPR and didn't hear the siren.
Sir, you need a permit to break the sound barrier
That's right, three. I got you for 12,775 in a 45, then 3,788 in a 65... plus Failure to Yield.
Yea, that's right, you've been off the Salt Flats for 5 miles.
According to Google maps this is the best route
Taking off, or landing?
Yes, I donate to the Police quarterly.
But I thought being part of the 1% gave me license to do anything, anytime, anywhere.
Is there something wrong, officer?
Do you know why I stopped you today, ma'am?
I've heard that one before.
You incinerated that bicyclist you passed.
Your tail-lights are not only burned out, they burned down several head of cattle and a few goats.
Those aren't street legal after-burners, are they son?
Sorry officer, I hit the wrong star-date.
All of our squad cars are now outfitted with warp drive.
Sir, are you licensed by anyone else besides Donald Trump?
"What makes you think I was speeding".
Here's a ticket for $1,000,006, you were going a thousand miles an hour above the speed limit. Slow down.
Really, that fast?
You were going Mach 3 in a Mach 1.
Do you realize you were going 200mph over the speed limit?
Your right rear breaklight is out, plus, this is the most extreme mid-life crisis car I have seen.
Officer, forget it. The judge won,'t believe you.
You know your left brake light is out?
Did you know your left rear light is out?
Break light's out.
Oh, didn't realize you're white. On your way.
Did you know that you have a tail light out?
Show me your pilot's license and registration.
You were doing Mach 1 in a twenty-five.
I pulled you over because your taillights are burned out.
You failed to signal before you turned and burned
you're going mach 3 in a mach 2 zone.
Fire or a weddin'?
Sir in some places passing to the left isn't even legal, let alone passing over them.
No arguments sir, your left and right rocket launchers need replacing.
Sorry 'Sully' but I'm going to need full name and registration.
I don't know what you're used to in the city, but there's a $50 fine for sonic booms in these here parts.
Got a spare jumper cable?
I realize that Mr. Musk but I will have to give you a ticket.
Sorry to stop you sir but your tail light is out.
Did you know you were going warp 2 in a school zone?
If you're not allowed to exceed the speed of light, it's for a reason.
It's a hybrid from Tesla and SpaceX
Please step out of the rocket. Your registration sticker appears to have expired last month.
Ticketing violators isn't rocket science. It's justice.
Have you by chance seen 2 thugs in hoodies? We've had some complaints.
Mr. Musk, did you realize your tail light was out?
Sir, your left tail light is out.
Barron, not again! What's your father gonna say this time?
The fine for Mach 1 is going to be a little stiff.
You made an illegal turn at the Skyway exit.
Just signal before you merge next time, okay?
I'm sorry Sir, but spear nose attachments are illegal in this state.
You were clocked going over 400 mph in a 55 zone but I'm letting you off with a warning this time.
Did you know that your left solid rocket engine light is out?
What's your hurry?
The box said after four hours see a doctor immediately.
It starts 95% of the time, do you think I should call AAA?
Don't give me that old "Which way to the Bonneville Salt Flats?" line. I hear it every day.
You'll need to take a defensive driver class.
You say you were only going 17,600 MPH ?
I stopped you for tailgating
Officer, I was just keeping up with traffic!
Yes, Officer, I understand - no more Ludicrous Mode here in Mayberry
Could you tell me which way to the moon?
Okay, where's the supernova?
Thanks for pulling over. I see you are not wearing a  seat belt, and your catalytic converter seems to be defective.
I didn't see anything... I heard a sonic boom.
Sorry, but the Salt Lake flats are in Utah.
Your brake lights are out. License and registration please
Hmmm...do I know how fast I was going...55? 75? 285? Let me know when I'm getting warm...
Mr. Musk, you're no longer in California.
You missed 74 stop signs and destroyed a cow. Selfie?
You were doing 25,000 mph in a 25 mph zone....
I've clocked you going 20x the speed of sound in a 10x the speed of sound zone.
Is it because I'm white?
NASA is really aiming low these days.
So you're going to Canada, are you? Can I hitch a ride?
If you were going any slower, I'd have to be writing you a parking ticket.
I don't know, couldn't have been more than eight hundred.
I clocked you at 850.
That's right, Mr. Musk. You're required to have both a front and a rear license plate.
I'm writing you up for a noise violation when you broke the sound barrier.
Sir, do you know how fast you were fleeing the country?
You were traveling at Mach 2 in a 45 mile per hour zone.
So this is the new Tesla!
I don't need to be a rocket science to give you a ticket, Mister.
Your parachute failed to deploy at the last stop sign.
Airplane seat belts don't pass muster down here, pal.
So sir I caught you for texting and flying...
Because I have acrophobia.
This is an illegal landing zone; I am going to have to ask you to move.
Great, now my insurance is going to sky rocket.
Sir, no need to speed yet. The Canadian border's open till January 20th.
Are you aware that you were going 60,000 mph over the limit?
How's the pick up?
Oh, so you heard the results of the election?
You were doing 38 in a 30 mph zone.
Hey rocket man. You might rule the skyway, but the highway is still my way.
Your tail lights are out.
Your afterburners need watering.
Don't give me that old perception and reality stuff.
I'll take a driver's license or a pilot's license.
I clocked you at 500 times the speed limit.
Sir, are you aware your license plate light is out?
Sir, do you know your left high pressure oxidizer turbo pump is out?
Your left rear after-burner is out.
Could you tell me how fast you were going?
I'm going to have to write you up on that missing tail light.
Can I see your smog certificate?
I don't care if you were faster than sound, using a phone while driving is illegal.
Sorry for the inconvenience Senator McConnell, and give your best to the Mrs.
Did you realize that you were doing Mach 7 in a school zone?
"You're kidding! This is a no fly zone?
Sir did you know your taillight was out?
No, I don't issue warnings to first-time rocket offenders.
Wrong turn Mr. Musk?
You were clocked at Mach 4 in a Mach 3 Zone.
You've got a broken tail light.
Yes, I do know how to get to the Bonneville Salt Flats but you were still speeding.
I had you doing Mach 4 in a 30 mile per hour zone.
Are you sure the sign didn't say ONE sixty-five officer?
For safety, I'll need you to push this off the highway until your tow arrives.
Do you know what mach you were going?
Do you know why I pulled you over, Sir?
Your right thruster light is out.
Sir, we frown upon breaking the sound barrier in these parts.
Sir, our radar has you going below warp speed.
I hear it all the time... and I'm guessing you're George Jetson.
Yeah, it may look like a rocket, but that doesn't mean it'll fly.
Congratulations. You've fully compensated.
But when I bought it seat belts were optional.
Excuse me, sir. Your left tail-light is out.
You failed to indicate upon re-entry
Have you consumed any alcohol sir?
Didja know you have a tail light out, sir?
...and also, you aren't buckled up.
Sir, I clocked you at Mach 1 over the speed limit.....
You just landed from the International Space Station, sure. And I'm Darth Vader, and I just landed from the Death Star. Now hand over your driver's license.
Your tail light has been out since the salt flats.
Did you know your left taillight is burnt out ?
The tail light?
I don't care that you're an astronaut--license and registration, please.
You were doing 10,000 in a 35.
But the final frontier has no speed limit!
That kinda speed might be okay where you come from, but you're on my planet now, boy.
I've got you going 763.035 mph, in a 45.
Michael J. Fox wore a plaid shirt.
Do you know how fast I was going, Officer?
I couldn't have been speeding. This is a hybrid.
I don't care that you've been to Mars and back, your tabs have expired. And what's with the Russian flag?
"you know that was a mach 1 zone back there sir"...
All right, then. Does Uber know how fast it was going?
I clocked you at Mach 2 in a Mach 1 zone.
I don't care if you are Elon Musk, you still need a vehicle emission sticker.
I can see you're in a hurry, so I'll write fast
Left at the light, two miles on the right you'll see the entrance to NASA.
I noticed you're missing your front and back license plates.
On the other hand, maybe I singled you out because you have a "fast" type of vehicle.
Just what do you mean by 'profiling'?
I'll need to see your registration and pilot's license.
I don’t care if you are just back from the future; here and now you need tail lights on our roadways.
Nothing can outrun a Prius.
Your left tail light is out. Oh, and I clocked you going 750 miles per hour.
I don't know Sir, but 6,000 mph in a 45 zone is going to be a heck of a fine.
So do you have any idea why I'm stopping you?
No, you can't get there from here.
Mail this in with the receipt for your new taillight and you'll be fine.
Sorry to bother you sir, we are investigating a rocket theft case, it's from a space facility near by. Have you noticed any suspicious activity recently?
You broke the sound barrier passing through Tenafly.
Cool your jets, bub, it's only a speeding ticket.
It's the texting, stupid.
I pulled you over because your emissions sticker is expired.
I know, officer. My brake lights are out.
Uber for Jim?
Mr Trump - you still have to obey the laws of the land...until January 20th
Sir, do you realize you were doing light-speed in a fifty zone?
I already warned Scotty not to beam you up.
The law is the law, Mr. Musk
No, the landing strip is three miles west of here.
Because you've got no brake lights.
How do you spell Armstrong?
We'll you're not above the law around here.
...and number 3, you failed to yield at the intersection three miles back!
I'm writing you up for the cost of a new radar gun.
Sir, did you know you were going 687 in a 35 mile zone?
This is just a warning. Next time make sure to turn off your blinker.
I clocked you a light speed in a warp speed zone.
I clocked you doing 735 in a 40!
I have frozen food in the trunk.
I see you’re a long way from home, Mr. Zxypyll.
Do you know you were going Mach 1,275?
Even if 110 is the average speed in your galaxy, here in South Orange it deserves our immediate attention.
Front license plates have been mandatory since 2001.
Sir, do you realize you were going Warp 4 in a Warp 2 School zone?
I contacted Houston and they don't know anything about a missing orbiter. Your license and registration please.
Your tail lights need to be visible at all times; I don't care if they're 'booster stages.'
License, please.
Just be glad that I'm letting you off with a warning...and that you're white.
Get off your phone!
What?
Did you know you were doing Mach 1 in a thirty mile per hour speed zone?
It's not my fault......My parents grounded me.
"Do you know you were doing Mach 2 in a 45 mile-per-hour zone?
Oh, you're white! My bad. Have a nice day!
Be patient, buddy. I've never written a ticket for speeding over 1,000 miles per hour.
I'm arresting you for DUI; Driving Under the Ionosphere.
I thought I'd never catch you. You passed me in Illinois!
I'm citing you for going Mach 2.0 in a Mach 1.0 zone. Have a nice day.
Sir, you were going 65,000 in a 65.
Do you know who I am?
Are you aware you were breaking the sound barrier in a 55 mile-per-hour zone?
I bought in on clearance after he abolished NASA
Mach 1 is the slowest she can go.
Astronaut license and NASA registration, please.
I do know how fast I was going. What's more, we've been out of your jurisdiction for the last 150 miles.
No, crossing a solid line is not the reason.
Sir, I don't where to begin.
Sir, do you realize you were going at the speed of light in a 30 mile per hour zone?
Before my radar gun exploded, it clocked you doing 500 in a 35 mile an hour zone.
We don't see many plates from up there.
Both your taillights are out.
Yes Officer. It's really that big.
O'k your names Robin...Batman's on vacation...and your testing the new Batmobile. Yeah I'l go along with that.
Klingon schmingon, entering warp drive without a seat belt gets you a ticket in these parts.
Sir Richard, I'm afraid that you were 1,401 mph over the speed limit.
You gave yourself away by breaking the sound barrier.
Sorry to have to do this, son, but that sound barrier was county property.
It's your front bumper--not pedestrian-friendly.
That's right, Officer. My name is Nose Cohen.
And, for breaking the sound barrier, the fine is double.
I had you doing Mach 3 in a 40.
Sorry officer, I thought that stood for Megaparsecs Per Hour
Whose your daddy now?
Sorry, but I'm going to have to write you up for a non-working muffler, ma'am.
I don't care what the speed limit is on Mars -- here it's 55 mph!
No, ma'am. It's not the broken tail light.
I can see your point.
I don't care what century you came from , here's your speeding ticket .
Burning rubber, burning titanium, they're the same in my book, buddy.
Do you know why I pulled you over, Mr. Musk?
One small step for a cop, one giant leap for mankind.
Sir I stopped you because you have a broken tail light
Sir, you were going at light speed. Do you know how long it took me to catch up to you?
Your driver's side tail light is out
Nobody exceeds the speed of sound limit on my watch, Mr. Yeager.
Rocket ship? Excuse me officer have you been drinking?
Sir, do you realize your were driving at light speed?
Ooo, Is that Rocket Man? I love this song! Turn it up.
Sorry, Sir. You were going so fast I couldn't tell you were white.
Sir, do you know how I pulled you over? Because I don't.
Are you aware that you've got a broken tail light?
No, your weren't speeding...you just fried a convoy of trucks.
Your afterburner is out.
OK Mach , who's having the baby?
Just think of it as a second afterburn.
Oh yeah, we'll we do things a little differ'nt here in Iowa.
No sir, Canada is the other way. And please, slow down.
I couldn't pass it up officer. It has less than 13 billion miles on it!
Elton, I still need to see your driver's license.
Are you aware that your left blinker is out?
No, actually, it's due to a joint program with the EPA concerning your exhaust.
Officer, I was just testing my kids Christmas present.
What seems to be the problem, Officer Buzzkill?
Only going the speed of sound? Well, that a first!
I clocked you at Mach 1 in a 25 mile per hour zone.
You know you were doing 340 in a 30 right?
It fits the description.
Aside from going 1,140 in a 25, do you know your tail light is out?
Your tail light burned out.
I clocked you going 520 in a 55 mph zone.
Let me guess... it's the new Infinity.
Sorry, but you're not allowed to land here.
Rocket science it may be but Cape Canaveral's the other way.
You have a busted tail light.
Do you know you've got a charred tail light?
George Jetson, huh? Give me your real name, wise guy.
Where's the fire, on the moon?
Sorry, Pal, lost your way going to The Salt Flats doesn't get it when you're in Kentucky.
A plane? Officer, have you been drinking?
I am giving you a ticket for not wearing a helmet.
This ain't the way to Bonneville, sonny.
Wir fahren fahren fahren auf der Autobahn?
Your right tail light is broken.
I get that the acceration is great, but isn't it tough to find a parking space?
Welcome home.
Again, Mr. Yeager, you’ve really gotta keep it under Mach 1.
Both tail lights are burned to a crisp.
How fast do you think you were going? And don't even try to mach me.
Yah. Sure, pal. And I'm an UberCOP.
Have the need for speed do we?
Texting while operating a vehicle is illegal in this state.
I'm curious - is this the new hybrid model?
You are getting a ticket for frightening the sheep.
Your left brake light is burned out, better get it fixed.
YES! I know how fast I was going... I didn't know your radar gun went that high
It's the Wienermobile, officer. The label fell off.
No, Sir. The need for speed is not a defense in this county.
Are you one of those Westinghouse finalists?
Mr. Houston, we have a problem.
I understand the urgency, but you might want to wait for the recount results
Diarrhea? Nice try, buddy, I've heard that one before.
Just sort of blew by that stop sign, didn't you fella.
Oh, you're white? You're free to go.
No, I'm serious. Where's the fire?
Ya gotta have a rear-view mirror, buddy. It's the law.
I know it's 55 mph, but I was only going to be out for five minutes.
What's the speed limit?
Your afterburner is violating our no smoking zone.
I stopped you because both your tail lights are out.
Well, if you hadn't broken the sound barrier, I wouldn't have pulled you over.
I clocked you doing Mach 1. Minimum speed here is Mach 2.
'Sorry, Officer. I missed the turnoff for the road less travelled.'
Yes, please tell me how fast I was going.
Hey Buck Rogers..Your tail light is out.
I'm pretty sure this is not an Oldsmobile Rocket.
You've never had to decelerate to subsonic speeds?  Tell it to the judge!
Sir, you have broken the law. And broken the land speed record.
"I don't care what your #&$@ing GPS is telling you. This is NOT the Bonneville salt flats!
We take texting while driving very seriously around here.
Mach 5 in a school zone.
You were breaking the sound barrier!
Sorry sir but I think one of your taillights has burnt out.
Do you know why I pulled you over? In Roswell, there are no intergalactic vehicles allowed on the scenic route.
Not your pilots license pal.
I started building November 9th.
Officer, just send the ticket to NASA
A speed trap? Seriously?
Let me guess. You have a stomach ache.
Everything seems to be in order, but i'd put a little more air in that right rear tire.
No, it's not that. Your tail light's burned out.
Sorry, I am giving you a ticket for a broken tail light.
Sir, I understand pilot's lives matter; please step out of the jet.
How many miles per gallon do you get with this thing?
I was just trying to keep up with traffic.
Do you know how fast you were going when you flew by me back there?
I've got you doing 4,622 in a 55 mile an hour zone.
'Going back to the future' just isn't going to cut it as a need to speed.
Did you know your tail light is out?
Sir, I pulled you over today because the license plate "L8R ERTH" has expired tags.
The speed limit in these parts is Mach 1
Sorry about your broken radar gun officer, but she stalls out at 250 MPH or slower.
Klaatu barada nikto
I stopped you for driving while back to the future.
These days, before we launch them into space, we road test them.
I swear officer, the rocket launchers are just for show
I'm not even sure I can give you speeding and noise ordinance tickets since you broke the sound barrier.
Sir, 'My Other Car is a Volvo' argument is specious
"Sir, the reason I pulled you over was that you were clocked back there going 600mph in a 25 mph school zone".
You know the Bonneville Salt Flats are in Utah.
Sir, are you aware that you've got two busted tail lights?
Do you have any idea how fast you were appearing to go?
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time before you drive again
You know the rules: click it or ticket.
Nice design. Was speed ever a consideration while you were building it?
So that's what they mean by speed of light!
I doubt that you would pass the emissions test on the first try.
I noticed that you were leaking a little nitrogen tetroxide...
No, it's not an excuse that you were going so fast that the stop sign was just a red blur.
A parade float, huh?
No way, I couldn't have been going the speed of sound!
You know, your left taillight's out.
License to kill and registration please.
I caught you doing 500 in the 25.
I'm gonna ask you to step outside and hover on one leg.
No, this is not one of those ripoff speed traps.
Would you like to contribute to the Fraternal Order of Police?
I'm impressed you caught me.
Seriously? You couldn't see my hand signal?
I'm not sure why the cartoonist let me catch up with you either
Can't you read the sign? It says 600 miles per hour speed limit!
I'm sorry officer, but I was too high to read the speed limit sign.
"This thing got a hemi"?
Mr Musk, we have a problem here
No sir, I didn't see you.
I don't care if you saw it on Mythbusters.
Don't worry, son. The boys'll take good care of your vehicle at the impound lot.
I pulled you over because you have a brake light out.
Yeah, well the lift-off you SHOULD worry about is your foot from the accelerator.
License, registration, and alt-idiot membership card please.
One of your tail lights is obliterated.
Since you're white, let's just consider this a friendly warning and call it a day.
Just letting you know, one of your tail lights is out!
You've got 10-days to get that brake light fixed.
Your license plate light is out.
Should have switched over to electric
One of your tail burners is out.
You see officer, if I go the speed limit I can't get off the ground.
Sir did you know that you were going 475 mph in a 25 mph zone?
Compare and contrast Schrödinger’s first paper on his wave equation and the Born-Oppenheimer method.
Sir, do you know how many Mach you were going?
The squad car? Hemi 5.7 engine. Why?
How about swapping vehicles?
I stopped you for an unconcealed weapon.
You were going down the road like a rocket.
Your license plate registration has expired.
I don't care if your girlfriend is "Out of this World."
NASA can't get you out of this one, sir.
Speeding? Really? It that what this is all about?
240 mph, and it runs on potatoes, amazing!
When's the last time you took this vehicle for its emissions inspection?
Your turn signal is out.
Just wanted you to know your tailight was out
No, I don't know why I was pulled over.
Sir, those appear to be aftermarket tailpipes, which require a permit in this county.
A ticket is a vote against American innovation.
Yes, you did miss the Salt Flats exit -- by 67 miles!
We're gonna need to do a gravity check.
Well, Mr. Musk, you are not on Mars and you have exceeded the 70 mph speed limit by 350 mph. This ticket should make our department budget for the year.
Sorry officer. The throttle is a little touchy.
The ticket is for texting while driving a rocket
You were going 120 miles over the speed limit.
No, this is Mars, Pennsylvania.
And who told you it was a runway?
Yes you can get a ticket for going too fast.
Your brake lights are not working.
I got you doin' mach two in a 50.
It's for driving without a seat belt!
Trust me, "Unrecordable velocity" on the radar screen will be a valid entry for the local justice of the peace.
Oh, pardon me, I though you were black...
No salt flats, no. But there is a salt lick just up the road.
Well, I couldn't tell you were white.
I got you for excessive exhaust flames…if you can keep it down to a flicker; that would be great.
Your left third booster stage is out.
For starters, you passed a school bus back there going 900 miles an hour.
Let's try to keep it under 2,000 mph and we'll call this one or a warning.
Do you know how many g's you were pulling?
If you want to contest the ticket, you can take it up with our Rocket Docket.
So you can either pay the $33, 172 fine, or take 692 Drivers Ed courses.
I noticed your left tail light is out
" Sorry Officer, I ran out of rocket fuel! I called AAA, they will be here soon.
Wanna trade?
You need to take exit 115 for the space station.
I'll let you off with a warning this time, but do get those taillights fixed.
I'll need to see your emissions test report.
Speeding, I was still in first gear.
Sir, the reason I pulled you over is that you broke the sound barrier in a clearly marked 35 mph zone.
stay in your lane
You were going supersonic in a subsonic zone,
License, registration and zero-gravity certification, please.
I got you doing Mach 2 in a forty-five.
...No sir I didn't stop you because a tail light was out.
Where's the nuclear fusion event?
Show me your license, registration and small hands, please.
Oh, sorry! Didn't realize you were in the Trump family.
Would you like to buy tickets to our benefit annual Highway Patrol Flower Show?
Did you realize that was a subsonic zone that you just drove through?
Sure, great acceleration.....but terrible turning circle.
This is a solid fuel booster only zone.
You were doing four thousand in a forty mile an hour zone.
It's a non-smoking zone, sir
I was only doing 499
Officer I took a left at Nevada and here I am...
"Your license plate has expired and you weren't wearing your parachute harness.
You were defying the law of gravity.
The president-elect just offered me the opportunity to apply for Secretary of Transportation.
I don't care if it was for only 20 seconds. Twelve hundred miles an hour in a 55 miles per hour zone is a bit much.
You know your tail light's burnt out?
It's gonna be a hundred dollar fine, and a referral for hormone therapy.
Seriously, Mr. Musk?!
I clocked you doing 768 in a 25.
You don't have a driver's license?
But it's self-driving
Sir, are you aware you were going 700 in a 600 miles per hour zone?
The President-Elect said it was fine.
Your descent into the atmosphere was 10 mph over the limit.
Do you know why I pulled you over? You were going 20 miles per hour over the sound barrier.
Do you realize you passed me over three-thousand times this week?
You were doing 6000 in a 35 so I am giving you a warning, but don't do it again.
Do you know why I stopped you? One of your taillights is burnt out.
I don't care what the speed limit is in space!
Yup, just a shade over 55.
I pulled you over because you have a left tail-light out.
Would you parachute out and put both hands on the vehicle please?
Your left turn signal is broken
All right I'm guilty......but how did you catch up to me?
May I see your proof of insurance?
Driver’s license, registration, and flight plan please.
Sir, do you realize that texting while driving is a dangerous offense?
I'm writing you up a ticket for rocketeering.
Click it or ticket.
Any idea what Mach you were going?
Are you aware that one of your taillights isn't working?
Are you aware that you were going 17,000 miles per hour in a 50 miles per hour zone?
sorry, officer..just trying to get a head start on the highway to hell..
Well, for starters let's take about your front bumper and we'll work our way back to the turn signal issue.
License, registration, and intergalactic passport, please.
Just a warning this time, sir, but do remember to get that tail light fixed.
Gotta write you up for a no-fly zone infraction, sir.
Sir, do you know why I pulled you over? Uh probably because I was going 500 miles per hour? No actually it's because you have a broken taillight, but now that you mention it...
Driving a vehicle without wing mirrors is dangerous and unlawful.
...and that's another citation for not wearing your seatbelt.
Sorry officer, but I am hurrying to Canada.
Things looked different when Tesla bought SpaceX
'I think it's going to be a long, long time...before you get your licence back.'
I clocked you at about a light-year in a 55.
Why yes, I am a New York Jets fan. How did you know officer?
This is not the autobahn
This is your last warning, Mr. Sullenberger.
I'm gonna let you off with a warning. But if you don't fix that taillight, next time's a ticket.
I clocked you at only 45 miles per hour, What's the matter with you?
You don't see them steering wheel knobs much anymore.
You're tail light is incinerated. Get it fixed. Next time, I'll have to give you a ticket.
In town for the Inventors Convention?
Thanks to you I'll exceed my monthly ticket quota.
Break the law? Yes. But you also broke the sound barrier.
In this county we strictly enforce the light speed limit.
Vehicles of this size are supposed to have mud flaps.
Do you know you have a tail light out?
Mr. Jetson, do you have a license for this century?
You were only doing 30 in a 45 MPH zone.
Sorry, thought you were the other kind of alien
Speeding is an abstract concept, don't you think?
Do you realize that your brake lights need replacement?
Illegal muffler.
Do you have any idea how fast you were Boeing?
Well, you're being cited for an illegal bumper, failure to wear a helmet, and going Mach 2 through a construction zone.
Yeah right, and your Elon Musk.
You've got to be the least endowed person I've ever pulled over.
I don't care that your wife sent you out for milk.
Fact is, sir, there is no smoking on any thoroughfare statewide.
Are you aware that you didn't signal before you moved to warp speed?
You were doing Mach 4 in a 55 zone.
"I don't recognize this import, but your taillight is out.
Gee officer, I'm really just taking up space.
So... you don't want to live on this planet anymore... I'll make a note of it. However, while you're still here, I will need to see your license and registration. I'm sure you understand.
Officer, I swear, this thing NEVER got airborne.
Are you aware you were going Mach .65 in a Mach .40 zone?
Your driver's license expires 20 years from now, Mr. McFly
And you have to get this rocket back to Cape Canaveral fast, Is that what I'm supposed to believe?
I would've let you off with a warning, but your failure to have a proof of insurance card is something I just can't ignore.
When's the last time you had a smog check?
I'm gonna let you off this time, but you've got to replace that front bumper.
You blew right through that last sound barrier.
Son, where on Earth did this pass emissions...L.A. or China?
Do you know why I asked you to pull over?
Not for speed. For contaminating the GMO crops.
Sir, I'm going to have to bring you in to the space station.
Your license doesn't show a rocket endorsement, but your "Mars or Bust" tee shirt tickles me. I'll let you off with a warning.
It appears you have an unpaid parking ticket.
I believe you have an aardvark in your tailpipe.
Did you know you have a broken tail light?
Actually, you're still hurtling through space at about 67,000 miles per hour.
You were misinformed. This is the Interstate, not the Interstellar.
Are you aware your left rear backup thruster indicator light is burnt out.
Pilot's license and registered flight plan please.
Sir, do you know why I pulled you over?
Looks like your left tail light is out.
Why? Your seat belt wasn't fastened.
But officer, I wasn't even out of first gear!
I'm gonna let you go with a warning this time, but don't let me catch you driving at the speed of sound again.
Your taillight is burned out.
I'm afraid the Trump Administration's new fuel efficiency standards haven't gone into effect yet sir.
Buddy, everyone thinks they're an urban legend.
No. I don't know where the fire is.
I stopped you because your left tail light is out.
I'm going to have to write you up for driving without headlights and rear view mirrors.
You have a broken taillight. I'll just give you a warning.
You're going to jail Mr John, and I think it's gonna be a be a long, long time.
You were going six light years in a four light years zone.
You were doing the speed of light in a speed of sound zone. I clocked you at about 881,741 miles/per hour.
Yet you pulled over.
OK. Where's the launching pad?
You failed to signal turning into to the stratosphere.
Did you know you were doin' 4.9 miles per second in a 35 miles-per-hour zone?
I'm sorry, officer. I just REALLY needed to get to a restroom.
Sir, you're in the HOV lane.
Do you know why I'm pulling you over?
I didn't see the speed limit upon reentry.
What's all the rush?
Your speed was fine, but I'm going to have to ticket you for overcompensating.
You see, Officer, it doesn't matter if the lights are on when you're going this fast.
The State of Iowa doesn't care if it is a hybrid.
Are you aware one of your tail-lights is out?
Yep, BOTH taillights!
You are probably wondering why I pulled you over......your left tail light is out.
Your catalytic converter is busted.
Sorry. Trump's jealous.
Thanks for pulling over, it gets lonely out here.
I wasn't speeding officer. This thing can go a lot faster.
You were doing Mach 4 on a Mach 1 road, that’s what!
No matter what galaxy your from you still need a current license plate.
We're you aware that one of your tail lights is out?
It's not Rocket Science Sir. If you wish to contest the fine follow the instructions on the back of the summons.
"THE PROBLEM"?......."You were going mach2 in a 55mph zone"!
Einstein was wrong. Space/time does not apply to I66.
I can't step out! There's no door!
Sir, the speed limit on this road is 35 mph, not the speed of sound.
Do you know why I pulled you over?" "To play guessing games?
You might be used to going that fast on Mars, but now you're in my County!
But in my frame of reference, officer, I wasn't speeding at all.
Your tail lights aren't working sir.
I can't move it. Somebody planted bean vines in the afterburners.
'That's baloney kid...Uber requires a four door"
Wrote down around speed of sound.
Well, if you can't return from this Alpha Centauri on your court date, you'll just have to pay the fine... and if I see you around these parts again I may have to write you up for that hood ornament.
Both your taillights are out.
It's a hybrid what?
Sorry, officer, but this is the last place I expected a warp speed trap.
You sure are in a hurry to cross into Canada!
Your left turn signal is out.
For a midlife crisis lasting longer than 4 hours, call the authorities immediately.
At 637 mph, I'm surprised you missed the sign.
Officer, the sign did say 395.
Officer, it's clear that you are targeting me on account of my race.
I've never been stopped before. How about a warning?
I've clocked you and I think you might have been speeding.
Hello officer. Is my tail light out?
What's your excuse this time, Mr. Musk?
Thank you, Officer. I'll take care of that tail light right away.
The good news is I'm only going to cite you for going 255 over the limit.
Do you have any idea how many light-years per hour you were going?
I have no idea, but I know I haven't broken the light speed barrier.
Of course I was speeding. Some idiot with flashing blue lights has been trying to overtake me for the last half hour.
But sir, it's the open road
The salt flats? They're 200 miles back that way.
Well, Mr. Rocketman, we call them spike strips.
You ran a light at Galaxy protocluster LBG-2377
That's 'Barron' with two r's?
It appears your registration lapsed last month.
Yer telling me you were on cruise control?
I clocked you doing 35 in a school zone.
Burned out tail light !! Not again !!
Sir, do you have any idea how slow you were going?
OK, buddy, you think you're in a rocket ship or something?
You're wondering how I caught up with you? Three words; nitrous oxide boosters
DOES THAT THING HAVE A HEMI
Did you see the light speed limit sign?
Mach 1 works for me. Years, 5 to 10, work for you?
You were speeding - it's not rocket science
Don't flatter yourself. I zap everybody.
Well, Apple Maps says this is the way to Mars.
Better get that tail light fixed or you won’t pass inspection.
Yeah ... really cool landing, but I still need to see your license, vehicale registration and insurance papers.
I don't care if you made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs, you're still in Ohio.
I'm giving you two citations: no helmet; and missing inspection sticker.
Ah, Sir your tail light is broken.
NASA Astronaut mid life crisis.
I was just on my way to make America great again.
Sir, your taillight is out.
I pulled you over for breaking the speed of sound...but I'm going to give you a break...and make it for just 10 over.
I don't care if your GPS was wrong.
. . . and my radar gun fried!
You've got a taillight out. Pilot's license and registration, please.
They said I could test out the toupee before buying it, officer.
No. sir, the new administration has not privatized state highways, yet.
You were going 500 in a 30 mile an hour zone.
Back from the future, huh? Well when you see "Doc", tell him to put a governor on the flux capacitor.
Looks like you've got a tail light burned out.
I'm gonna ticket you for driving with a broken tail light.
But from 30,000 feet it looked like a runway
Know how fast you were going, Mr. McFly?
I'm sorry officer, but this thing won't go below 300 miles per hour.
Speeding?
Sir, I am going to have to issue you a ticket. That right brake light is not working.
By the way, how many miles per gallon on this thing?
Not speeding, I'm ticketing you for driving unreasonably.
Do you know you have a brake light out?
Is that a 'rocket in your pocket', or you just happy to see me?
Sorry to write you up, but you were really "burning up the road" back there.
The only problem is your taillight is out.
OK, I need for you to be honest with me, sir. Were you using your cell phone either immediately before, or during your landing?
I'm sorry, but the limit is Mach 3 in school zones.
And don't tell me your speedometer hasn't been working.
Your registration sir.You were clocked at Mach 1, 700 mph above the posted limit.
Tyler, its your left tail light....again.
I'm gonna need to take a look in the cargo bay.
Get it right and all you get is a warning, "why do you think I stopped you"?
I clocked you at 475 in a 30 zone.
What's in the bottle on the floor? Romulan Ale?
I clocked you at 500 mph... yesterday.
Your tail light is broken.
I'm sorry. A learner's permit won't suffice.
Show me your pilot's license.
I was told as it has only three wheels,no licence was needed officer.
No, this is not a 350mph zone, and I clocked you at 352mph anyway.
Fun's over kid.
... no, I can see where the fire is.
Good news is, you broke the land speed record. Bad news is, you were going 763 MPH over the limit.
I'm giving you a warning for a broken tail light.
Sun was in my eyes.
You're gonna have to fix those tail lights, kid.
You were caught doing 450 in a 55 mph zone.
Im sorry sir, but you were doing Mach 2 in a school zone.
Your diarrhea required you to go Mach 3?
I don't care what your GPS is telling you, this is not the way to the International Space Station.
Sorry officer, but left my license in my other flight suit.
Every part built in the U.S.A...except the GPS.
May I see your pilots license and registration. I also hate the song Rocket Man.
Proof of insurance? You're kidding me, right?
Just think of the irony, to stay within the speed limit but get cited for not wearing a seatbelt.
Sir, The reason I stopped you is because you broke the sound barrier in a 'No Sonic Boom' zone.
License suspended -- And I think it's gonna be a long, long time.
You were going 763 mph in a 65 mph zone.
You're being stopped for mach-ing a police officer.
I noticed about two counties back your tail light was out.
Now that everyone uses GPS, renaming our town Bonneville Salt Flats, Minnesota has done wonders for my quota.
Sorry, I think I left my registration at Alpha Centauri.
I clocked you doing 780 miles per hour back there in a 35 mile per hour zone.
I'm from Mars.
Sir, did you know you've got a tail light out?
I'm going to give you a warning notice. Make sure you have a front license plate the next time I see you.
“So you say you're a speeding bullet fired from an open carry weapon…. well that makes you entirely legal in this State!
So you're saying there were a lot geese and you go by "Sully"?
No, I said the ticket was for driving like one.
You know your left tail light is out?
You were doing 38 in a 30 mph zone.
Thanks, Officer. I just called for 'AAA'.
Didn't you see the 'Mach 3 Speed Limit' sign before you melted it?
I didn't see the speed limit, I was going too fast.
Sorry but the speed limit is miles per hour
I'm from the future. Where are the Donald Trump voters?
"I clocked you doing 600 mph in a 45 mph zone!
I'm sorry, Officer. The speedometer's not very accurate at speeds under Mach 1.
I don't know how to write you up for spawning a tornado in a school zone.
You're the second fool to drop out of warp on this road.
Did you know your have a cracked tail light?
But with these afterburners I get zero emissions officer.
I clocked you doing Mach 1.102 in a Mach 0.058 zone.
You say it's a 2016 Phallic XL?
Three wheels means motorcycle. This is a G license; not an M.
Didn't you see the ' NO RIGHT ON RED PLANET ' sign?
Better get that rear left turbine fixed, sir. Next time it'll be a citation.
I'm going to have to write you up for excessive ego.
According to your license, you are only permitted to go warp speed while in flight.
No, there ain't no jet fuel in this county.
How can it be a pedal car if I clocked you passing another car at 545 miles an hour?
Police officer, on radio to station: "Another guy trying to escape the Trump presidency"
Your tail light was broken sir
Sorry officer. I ran out of gas and my phones dead. Can you call my mom.
Do you realize your plates are missing?
Your Mom called to tell us you forgot your glasses.
The eagle has not landed. In fact, it splattered onto your windshield.
Do you know how fast you were going? Let's just say waaaaay over the limit.
Wouldn't you?
Do you know what Mach number you were going sir?
I clocked you doing Warp 2 in a 45 mile per hour zone.
Nice try. If you were anywhere close to the "landspeed record," I wouldn't have been able to pull you over.
Sorry officer, I was sure I was doing under the speed of sound.
Out of fuel?
Son, your inspection sticker has expired.
Nevertheless, I clocked you at one mile per hour over the limit.
I clocked you at 20 mph under the speed limit.
Did I break the sound barrier, Officer?
Sir, there is law in this state against three wheel cars.
Let me see your license and interplanetary registration.
I stopped you for doing Mach 2 in a School Zone.
You were clocked at Mach 3. The fine's going to be somewhere just over a million.
I don't care if it is self driving, sir.
Buddy I'm just tryin' ta return this piece'a junk ta Elon Musk.
Sir, do you have any idea how jealous I am?
And it makes popcorn.
I'm not sure how I got here, I'm sure I typed Mars into my waze app.
Remember, left lane is for passing only.
Does it really run on the tears of Democrats?
Good afternoon. Still feelin' the Bern, there, sir?
You roared through a stop sign back there.
Sir Your Right Taillight is out
Well sir, here on our planet, the speed of sound is 40 M.P.H.
What did you expect when it said "jet propulsion"?
"Auto-pilot huh?" Heard that one before.
Didn't you see the lights flashing and hear the siren?
Which part of, this isn't the Autobahn, don't you understand kid.
Did you know your registration has expired?
Honestly, I did6t think you'd catch me.
572 miles an hour over the speed limit, Mr. Jetson. That's a new personal best for me!
Speeding? No! Your headlights are out and you should check if that muffler needs servicing.
Your tailight's broken. Fix it.
Sneering a sarcastic 'Where's the fire?' is usually the high point of my day. Thanks to you I'm caught between a rocket and a hard place.
Pretty impressive, but what was your plan for the Van Wyck?
Are you aware you don't have a licence plate visible?
I'll need your registration, insurance and pilot's license please...
License, registration, and I'm gonna need to check the size of your hands.
Sir, we've been getting complaints about a half-baked dream.
Are you aware that you were going above the speed limit?
Sir did you know your taillight was out?
Your brake light blew out.
I forgot my homework.
You were doing 580 in a 35, but I'll cut you a break and note your speed at an even 500.
You say this is an Oldsmobile Rocket 88?
Registration, driver's license and how many miles per gallon do you get from this?
I don't care if you ARE Elon Musk!
I clocked your landing at 100 mph in a 50 mph zone.
Don’t you remember me warning you not to go ballistic the last time I gave you a ticket?
A baby? Tell that to the judge.
This is a quiet zone and you broke the sound barrier.
You can use hand signals.
While you look for your registration, explain again why the stabby-tip bit is so essential.
Your booster tail light is out.
Sir, I clocked you going 3 Gs in a 1 G zone.
Your court appearance will be in Vienna."
Let me guess: a bad flux capacitor?
You're getting ticketed, wise guy, because its a violation to drive without license plates.
Sir, I'm gonna let you go with warning today. Get that headlight fixed.
Thank you, officer. Now let me hear you count backwards from 10.
It's against the law to Vape the public in Nebraska
I'm giving you a ticket for your emission!
Do you have any idea what Mach you were doing?
Do you realize that you were going over Mach 1...
Do you know why you'r being pulled over?
I can't hear you. You were exceeding the speed of sound.
Do you realize how many light years you were going over the speed limit?
What do you think this is, reality TV!
Your Learner's Permit has expired.
Why yes, Officer, it does compensate!
I though fire counted as a tail light.
Trying out the new Dodge Dart, huh?
...and what is the make, model, and year of your vehicle?
I'm going to give you a warning this time - just don't let me catch you driving while Black.
One of your tail lights is out.
I don't care if you're a rocket man, you still have to wear your seat belt.
License and NASA propulsion data, please.......
I wasn't speeding, I crash-landed !!!
Sir, are you aware that you were going seventeen-thousand in a sixty-five?
Do you know many times over the speed of sound you were going?
License, please.
I figured you weren't from these parts - all our local micropenises tend buy assault rifles
When's the last time you had a smog check?
I don't care what 'Elon' said. Energy credits do not offset points on your license!
Do you realize your tail light was out.
I'm afraid I don't know how you get this thing out of second gear.
Well, you're going to have to make America great again within the speed limit, Eric.
How many times do I have to tell you to get the light fixed on this piece of ship.
I'll let you go with a warning: that you may be overcompensating. Though I suppose you'll guarantee me that there's no problem there.
If I told you I was just flying really low, would you still give me a ticket?
It might be your first time, buddy, but you're not getting just a warning for being 300 mph over the limit.
Elon.......Elon Musk.
I stopped you because you have a tail light out.
There's no way I was going 1,000 mph, officer. This thing will barely do 950.
It's actually a Prius with the Trump package
You were doing warp 3 in a warp 1 zone.
Pal, I'd say your good idea never got off the ground.
I don't care if you did merge Tesla with Space X, Mr. Musk, 55 mph means 55 mph.
Can I see your driver's license and proof of maturity.
I'm giving you a warning this time. But, really, try to be below the speed of sound next time.
That was a fun chase, but I have to give you a two-point ticket for no front license tag.
Your exhaust pipes are too large.
Don't you think your catching up with me should be punishment enough?
Click it or ticket.
One of your landing lights is out.
Sorry buddy, gotta write you up for that broken finlight.
Listen, I really don't care if you're late for the space race.
You were doing 60,000 in a 60 zone.
Let me see your flight plan.
Did you know that one of your brake lights is out?
I'm sorry sir. It's your muffler. Fix it!
I stopped you because you have an expired Leonard Nimoy for president bumper sticker.
So Tesla merged with SpaceX?
You were only 3 light years an hour over the limit so I'm going to let you off with a warning
Someone certainly has a need for speed.
And that will be another 80 dollars for texting at the same time.
Sorry, officer. I guess I didn't see the Giant Stop sign for Mankind back there.
Your license plate is dirty!!!
You know you were going 400 in a 35 mile zone?
I clocked you doing Mach 7 in a Mach 5 zone.
Keep your hands on the controls, sir.
Is this the road to the Bonneville Salt Flats?
Sorry, Officer. Cruise control was too expensive an option.
Operating a vehicle that resembles a sex-toy is a violation in this state.
Sir, are you aware you were going Mach 2.4 above the legal speed limit?
Do you realize that both your taillights are out?
If this thing had doors, I would totally ask you to step out!
Sorry Officer, I accidentally hit the afterburner switch.
Do you know how fast you were going?
Well officer, what did you expect me to spend my tax break on?
Isn't texting and flying different than texting and driving?
Your Brake lights burned out.
Your warp drive astroglobumeter light is out--the left one.
Well, for starters, it seems obvious you never got a smog compliance certificate.
There are NO salt flats in this state sir. Now how about you tell me your real destination ?
I've stopped you due to a reported mid life crisis.
Sir, are you aware that your taillight is broken?
I suppose you're wondering why I pulled you over. You're afterburners are out.
...and you've got tail light out.
No, not for speeding. For moving too slow in the new world order.
I'm ticketing you for a burnt out tail light because my radar does not work above 100 MPH.
I clocked you doing the land speed record in a 30.
I was just trying to find the parking meteor
Left brake light's out.
Impressive! You were going 117, 000 in a 35.
Yes, I do know how fast I was going. Do you?
What's your problem, Officer?
Sir, I had you going 320 in a 55 mph zone.
Your left tail light is out.
Actually, your tail lights were too bright.
Officer, have you tried these donuts? They are out of this world.
Sir, what direction are you trying to go?
Yes, Mr. Musk, I do think repurposing is a good idea, but you don't have any side mirrors!
License and 'Guinness Book of World Records' registration, please.
It makes perfect sense, Officer. I'm afraid of flying.
Looks like you took the wrong shuttle service.
It was only when I slowed Dow that I realized I was no longer on the salt flats.
You broke the sound-barrier in a quite zone.
Officer, my wife's having a baby. Granted, it's on Mars, but....
Do you know what mach you were traveling at?
License and registration please.
Late for dinner or not, I'm afraid breaking the sound barrier is not permitted in this county.
I clocked you at Mach 1 over the limit.
But Officer, how else would I achieve lift-off?
I don't think the "M" in mph means "Mach," Sir.
I don't care who you are--I need your license and registration, Mr. Musk.
Oh, I see Baby Einstein got his learner's permit.
No, buddy, I don't know where you can get aviation fuel around here.
You got vroom for one more?
For one, I clocked you doing Mach 2 in a Mach 1 zone…and you have a taillight out.
I am just driving my vehicle to the emission testing centre, Officer.
Being late for your shift at Cape Canaveral is no excuse for driving at warp speed, sir.
You know you were going mach 2 in a 75mph zone right?
Say there, pal, are you aware your left turn signal is out?
Sorry officer, did I break the sound barrier?
Do you know how many times the speed of light you were going?
You know your left tail light is out?
I'm giving you a ticket because you have a broken afterburner.
You knew your tail lights were out, right?
Drive at that speed and you're going to end up in a Large Hadron collision.
License and registration please. I clocked you at 17000 mile per hour.
Canadian geese again, eh Sullenberger?
What color is your parachute?
Sir, are you aware you were going 800 in a thirty-five?
Frankly, I'm sick and tired of you young rocket scientists trying to migrate to Canada.
I'm letting you off with a warning. Next time try not to break any land-speed records.
I had to pull over a Wienermobile two miles ago.
Well, this certainly looks like a 'no caption needed' situation.
'Yes, sir, the land speed record is over the speed limit."
Do you realize you were going 15,000 in a 60 zone?
Never Mach with the law son.
Let me explain: I work for Elon Musk.
Left tail light out, bud.
I don't think this meets the new clean air emission regulations...
I was just keeping up with traffic.
No shit 'I'm just back from Uranus' is a crappy excuse.
You were going 100,000 miles per hour in a 50,000 miles per hour zone.
You say a speedometer did not come standard?
Let me get this right. You want me to write a bigger ticket for you.
Wait! Wait! Let me guess- you thought this was 1965, you're Craig Breedlove, and this is the Bonneville Salt Flats! Right?
I got it at a government surplus sale.
Where's the fireball?
You were definitely over the speed limit.
You blasted through a stop sign, went Mach 2 in a 35 mile-per-hour zone, and failed to signal when changing orbits.
2,000 mph is against the law in this town.
That squad car does 650.
1.21 giga watts you say?
Your left brake light, sir.
You were going 40 in a 35 zone
You forgot to signal while passing.
Sir, I clocked you at 45 in a 35 zone, AND your left tail light is out.
I'm sorry for pulling you over, Mr. Aldrin, but your tabs expired in 1969.
You changed lanes without using a signal
Whoa....this thing run on Hi-Test or Regular testosterone?
Did you notice the 47 stop signs you ran through, sir?
So that's E-L-O-N M-U-S-K?
We already won the space race, comrade.
Alright, sir, I'm going to let you off with a warning.
Do you have any idea what Mach you were doing?
Okay buddy, where's the fire?
No, officer. I have no idea why you stopped me.
Despite your "need for speed," the limit is still 35 mph
You right turn indicator light is not working
Yes, I DO know; it's not rocket science!
No, seriously, your tag light is flickering. This is a warning.
May I have your autograph?
Clocked you at mach one.
Trump said it was OK.
You were doing 600 in a 40 zone. License and patent please.
Sir, I don't care what the salesman told you. This is a Bonneville car, but definitely not a Pontiac.
Nope hotshot, you're in Bonneville, Tennessee.
Sir, may I see your pilots license?
I'm sorry officer. I was looking for the Intergalatic Super Highway.
--Was I driving too fast, officer?" "--No, you were flying too low!
I stopped you, because you were driving under the affluence.
Tail light's out.
Golly, in all my light-years, I have never pulled something like this over
Try not to open her up until after 9:00.
I'm sorry sir, but it is mandatory for you to buckle your seatbelt prior to take-off.
Do you know how slow you you were driving?
No mufflers or turn signals, and those afterburners don't count as tail lights, either.
You cannot drive with just a pilot's license!
You missed a stop sign back there
Sorry about that, it seems this vehicle was registered to a black astronaut.
Officer, I was only going MACH 3
Can't find your way back to the launch pad?
Your rear tail lights are burned up.
Are you aware that your license plate is expired?
My car is still faster than yours.
My partner bet me $20 you're gonna tell me you're the son of Jor-El
I'm sorry officer, I was just taking her for a test drive and got carried away!
Let me see your hands.
Cool your jets, Flash Gordon. Your license plate is burnt toast.
I don't care what the poet said; you can't 'Go and catch a falling star' on a Kansas state highway.
See Mr. Musk, it says right here you must be wearing corrective lenses while operating a commercial spacecraft.
You said it's 'M - U - S - K'?
Do you know how much faster than the speed of light you were going, sir?
Breaking the sound barrier is illegal in this state.
Well we have a law against setting land speed records in this town.
Sir, I noticed that you don't have any tailights, which is illegal on this planet.
Sorry officer, I can't drive 55.
I'm afraid your license is only good on Mars, Mr. Musk.
I don't care if you ARE a rocket scientist. You were making 500 over the limit.
Sir, I think one of your tailights are out.
You were going about 340 miles per second.
I am giving you a ticket for not wearing your seat belt.
Sir, I don't care if your name is Elon Musk or Edmund Muskie, I clocked you at 8oo miles per hour!
i left my licence on the other planet
Sorry, I misjudged your complexion through the tinted plexiglass.
No, sir, you have not landed on Mars.
I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to give you a ticket. Your passenger-side tail light is out.
We'll need to head to the space station for further questioning.
I don't care if you heard a 'Beep-Beep,' or that you are from the Acme Rocket Company. Tell Mr. Wiley Coyote we are impounding his car.
Sir, one light speed not two.
I'm citing you for excessively poor body image.
Officer, give me a break! Rocket speed is 17,000 miles per hour. I wasn't even going close to that.
670,616,629 in a 45.
I've been after you since that illegal left turn at Mars
Do you realize that you have a broken tail light ??
'Do you realize how slowly you were going?'
Your afterburner scorched my cruiser, so that's an additional ticket on top of going 785 mph in a 35 zone.
Please step out of your vehicle, sir. I'd really like to take it for a spin.
I pulled you over for a blown tail light........license, registration and are you carrying any laser pistol, sir?
Sir, your registration is light-years ahead of time.
I'll let you off with a warning if you let me take it for a whirl.
Yes, I HAVE seen 'Back to the Future.'
:\"Yup, you forgot to signal that right hand turn"
Officer, the sign clearly said the speed limit is Mach 25.
Do you know why I pulled you down?
I understand that 55mph on Mars equals [c + (1 - ?1/n2)V] on earth, but you were still driving 300mph. License and registration please.
Oh sorry, you're white. Have a lovely day, Mr. Musk.
License and registration, please. And, don't worry, you just had a very burned out tail light.
Hey Buddy, do you know that your left tail light is out?
Just because you have a TXH1138 Hyper Speed Cruiser, doesn't mean you own the road.
I don't want to hear about the escape velocity. On this road the speed limit is 55mph.
You still have your dealer plates on
On your way to Canada, I presume?
No officer,, the speed limit is the speed of light . I wasn't going anywhere near that.
Exceeding the speed of sound again
Stay here while I check the cloud.
You changed parsecs without signaling.
To be honest I don't really know, officer. My speedometer is stuck at 0.5 Mach.
Two jets and an after-burner and you can only clocked 75? My Chevy can beat that.
Did you realize this is a school zone?
Your tabs have extinguished
I know more about these things than the NASA folks do, believe me.
Yeah. 217 in a 35 zone. You're gonna get a ticket.
Speed of sound? Sorry, Mac, not on this planet.
Officer, I wasn't going any faster than mach 1.
Ma'am, you were going 30 mph in a 25 mph speed zone.
Do you realize you were going 200mph over the speed limit?
Did you know that you have a busted tail light?
I'll let you off with a warning this time, Mr. Jetson.
You obviously didn't see the sign back there, but this is a one way street.
No, Sir, policemen don't have balls.
You would be in big trouble if you weren't a white man.
Your speed broke my radar detector.
Her name is Schrodinger, she was going all speeds.
Ah, Sir your tail light is broken.
It's not 45 Machs per hour?
I don't care if you only have two speeds, 15 in a 45 is a hazard, sir.
Sir, may I see your pilot license and registration?
But I thought it was a runway.
I clocked your afterburners at 3000 degrees in a 2500 degree zone.
Since you were going only 300 miles an hour over the speed limit I'll let you off with just a warning.
So where did you get this hot rod?
Don't care where you came from. You're going BACK!
Looks like you got a brake light out.
Your sound system is in violation of town ordinance.
Firstly, I'd like to thank you for taking care of my pension.
Sir, you can't park here.
The black box will prove that I was only doing 55.
Where's the fire, bub?
Didn't see that little old lady you toasted back there did ya.
Sir, one of your tail lights is out.
I've got news for you Toto. You're not in Bonneville anymore.
I understand that from your perspective I was speeding, but from my perspective I have the ticket book.
Tell me again why I should believe this nonsense about a 'warp drive,' Mr. Kirk.
Do you know why I pulled you over today?
One of your tail lights melted my radar gun!
Sorry, I'm looking for the registration. This is my mother-in-law's car, and it looks like her glove compartment is just completely packed with stuff.
I'd never have caught you if you didn't slow down to moo at the cows.
Do you have any idea how fast I was going?
Is this an oversized vehicle you're driving, or are you just pleased to see me?
"Officer, would saying 'TAKE ME TO YOUR LEADER' stop the speeding ticket " ?
How many mph do you get on this thing?
Sir, may I ask you why you were driving well below the posted speed limit?
Ma'am, you've exhausted all of your warnings.
You were going 850, but I'm going to write you up at 490.
Has this vehicle been smog-checked?
Your emissions test certification please.
Thanks for clearing the frost off my windshield.
You got a busted tail light.
Sir- Can I have a lift ?
I clocked you going mach 1.
'I'm ticketing you for texting and speeding.'
So you figured you'd just jet up to Canada.
NOT SPEEDING----OSTENTATIOUSNESS!
Hmmmm, the nearest Dilithium station must be about two light years from here.
Your model rocket? As a kid, my model rocket was made of balsa wood. I'm giving you a ticket just for ruining my childhood memories.
I pulled you over because your right tail light is broken.
You were clocked going too fast while standing still.
You were going 3,000 in a 20 mph zone.
Sir, the reason I pulled you over is that your mid-life crisis failed to launch.
How fast did you say you were going…?
You were obviously exceeding the speed of light, since this type of vehicle has not been invented yet.
Actually, your taillight is out.
I clocked you 450mph over the speed limit.
I hate to do this but you have an expired emissions sticker.
Musk...How exactly do your spell that, Sir?
Mr. Armstrong, could I get an autograph?
Do you realize you ran that stop sign back there ?
Mr. Musk, do you have a permit for that?
Your left indicator light isn't working.
"Oh, sorry, your white. No problem.
I clocked you at Mach 3 in a clearly marked Mach 2 zone.
Hey buddy, did you know your tail light is out?
I thought you'd be driving the weiner car.
It’s Korean. North Korean.
Even with your afterburners on, you barely beat that train to the crossing.
But you see Officer, in Light Years I was well under the limit.
No excuse sir, Inauguration Day is not until January 20th.
Sorry, officer, the traffic signal's awful hard to see at light speed
Sir, you hit an e-mail box back there.
It's a good thing you're white, or that broken taillight could have caused you a whole bunch of trouble!
No trucks, buses or rockets in the left lane!
License and registration, please. Cooling your jets is a crime around here.
Sir, are you aware that you ran a stop sign back there?
Uh, Ground Control to Major Tom... You've really made the grade, sir...
Stepping out of the car with his hands up was always problematic for Gordon.
Sir, do you realize you were going three miles over the speed limit?
Trust me, it's my first offense.
I saw no signal for your last maneuver.
Sorry I was tailgating, I guess I didn't leave enough SPACE
Okay, I'm letting you off with a warning this time. Your left rear blinker's out.
I need to see your proof of insurance.
Yes, sir, the Trump Environmental Protection Act clearly states only one coal turbine per vehicle.
You have a broken nozzle light.
I'm writing you a ticket for going 250 in a 55 and because you just melted it, billing you for a new radar gun.
Do you know you were doing 750 in a 700 mile per hour zone?
Do you know how many Machs you were going?
I have a taillight out?
You were going 50,000 in a 35 zone.
Do you know I clocked you at 600?
Your jet engines are roasting all of the crops.
I got you for going under the minimum Bob....again.
Ever hear the one about the tortoise and the hare?
So are you like a super villain or is this just a mid life crisis type scenario?
But officer, I only had it on cruise control
You know your tail light's out?
I clocked you at 17,550 miles per hour over the speed limit, so your ticket will be $877,650.
Because you were going 500 in a 50.
Sorry, but out here science stuff is against the law.
You ran gravity 5,000 miles back.
I don't know about the sound barrier, but it was definitely over 65.
Didn't you see the signs, "Minimum Speed, 45 m.p.h." ?
Have you been exceeding the speed of light?
I'm just taking it for a test drive on a quiet country road.
Sure I heard about the election but that's still no excuse.
I'm going to let you off with a warning for not signaling a lane change.
Looks like you'll need a lawyer who's quick, too.
Ever since the price of jet fuel has dropped again, I seem to be writing more of these tickets than ever!
Mars? You'll want to take a left at the old oak tree, bear upwards into the stratosphere, and continue for about 140 million miles.
I stopped you because you have a broken tail light. And you were going 468 miles per hour.
A little far from the salt flats, eh?
Light speed limit? Just keep it under the posted number, buddy.
Your California emission test, please.
But officer, I couldn't have been doing 190 miles per hour- I've only been driving for 15 minutes...
I'll need your license and navigation, sir.
I think you missed the Hudson
... but do you own the insurance company? Mach one in a 35 MPH zone should be about 1,126 points.
You need to have your emission checked!
You may not use the election as a reason for wanting to leave the planet in a hurry.
How much did that baby set you back?
Sorry, officer -- my cruise control crapped out.
You were clocked doing 412 in a 350-mph zone.
You need to cool your jets, son. Did you know you broke the sound barrier back there?"
What do you have under that hood, officer?
Speeeeed limmmmmit 45; it's not rocket science.
I'm gonna write you a seatbelt violation this time. No more 300 mph in school zone.
The Hudson was taken.
I'm not saying you were speeding. I'm saying, it looked like you wanted to.
Your left turbine light is broken
This citation, sir, is for a clear GPS violation.
School zone speed limit is Mach 1.
Your license plate melted off.
Your tail lights are cooked.
Your registration tags expired.
Your afterburner's out on the right
You have a tail light out sir.
I told you a week ago to fix the break light. Got no choice but to give you a ticket.
Your registration is out of date
You were doing 3 g in a 1.5 g zone.
Please officer, are you absolutely certain that this isn't mars?
Your left brake light is out.
Do you have any idea how many miles over the sound barrier you were you were going?
Show me your registration and pilot's license.
I just replaced that tail light last week officer!
What kind of mileage do you et with this baby?
Look officer, I’m a millennial, I’ll take the ticket but first I need a selfie with you.
Are you aware that you don't have any brake lights?
But they assured me it was street-legal!
This will add a few bucks to your 'little routine trip to the moon.'
Are you aware your tag expired last light year?
Do you know what mach you were going?
Anything wrong, sir?". "No, I just want to ask where were you buy this thing?
Take me with you to the nearest blue state and I'll let you off with a warning.
Speeding?.... I wasn't even close to the speed of sound!
Not that type of cosmos, sir.
Escape velocity? And, why were you trying to escape?
I apologize, Mr. Musk. I didn't see you there.
That depends on how long you were following me.
My wife ran off with an alien.
I don't care if you're headed to Canada before they end Obamacare.
But my wife is having a baby!
Whoo-we, boy! By the time we git this here ticket tallied up, I should be able to RE-tire!
I will need to see your smog certification.
You've been speeding along like some kind of space cadet.
One question: How much mileage do you get?"
Looks like your program expired.
Don't be a wise guy, your tail light is out.
Do you realize you were doing 6oo in a 15 mile an hour zone?
Didn't you see the school zone sign?
Didn't you see the no afterburner sign.
You didn't use your turn signal, sir, when you changed planets.
License, registration, and smog certificate.
Sorry buddy bud this rocket is registered to Nasa.
Cuba is the other direction.
You were going mach 5 in a 25.
You were doing 683 in a 35 zone.
You just ran through every red light in the county, and one of your brake lights isn't working.
Your left brake light is out Sir.
Honestly, I did6t think you'd catch me.
Your right turn signal is broken!
Psycho license and registration please.
I believe I have now seen the pinnacle of male 'compensation'. Oh yes, and here is your ticket for burned out tail lights.
You are driving a vehicle for which no valid license exists.
I don't care if you're not the man they think you are at home. You still have a tail light out.
Your left taillight has been incinerated.
It's ok. It runs on clean coal.
Vines coming out if the exhaust sir. That's a violation right there, not to mention the shark fin and no tail lights.
I did signal. I held my hand out for the left turn.
I clocked you at 800 miles per hour.
I'm surprised you weren't driving faster to be honest.
How smart did you say dolphins were again?
Here's your speeding ticket. The limits's the speed of light and you were going 20 mph over.
I pulled you over because you were NOT speeding.
Son, I understand you're scared but taking a rocket ship to leave the United States before Trump's inauguration is a bit extreme.
My apologies President Trump, I didn't realize it was you.
Sir, did you know you were driving 4,577 mph in a 55 mph zone?
Joyriding again. Mr.Putin?
You voted for Gary Johnson and you drive this????
So you are going to Bonneville to break the land-speed record Señor, but how did you get over the wall?
Your right light is out.
I was going warp 35, officer!
Sir, do you realize you're driving with an expired sticker.
Oh you're one of Trump's kids? No problem, just try not to detonate this thing next time, ok?
You need a new muffler, and you need to stay out of the passing lane.
No, Sir, you weren't speeding. But you've got to be violating some kind of traffic law.
I'm so sorry officer, I was having an "NPR driveway moment."
I pulled you over because you roasted that flock of sheep when you rounded the last bend. The charge is operating a barbecue without a food handler's permit.
...and two counts of felony underwear abuse.
Well, first off, your parachute lights are not working.
You have a taillight out.
You say I was speeding?
Well, if you had so much brain surgery to perform, why were you running late in the first place?
No sir I'm sorry but you didn't make it back to November 7...let me see your Trump ID Package
Oh!!!! I apologize for your pulling you over sir! Your rocket whizzed by so fast, I couldn't make out if you were black or white.
Just blasting through huh? This is Amish country pal.
I notice you didn't pull over the rich guy in the tie-fighter.
Same ol, same ol, huh Jed?! Though by my recollection the wienerschnitzel mobile held better promise. Tell your Sis I miss her pie, and fix that exhaust, smells REAL bad.
Space-time trap?
Were you aware that VW has recalled this model too?
Ok. But at least get your lights fixed.
I clocked 300 in a 30 zone.
Really? I was going that fast?
I'm citing you for tailgating the Klingon starship.
I don't care what your name is Han. You still can't drive Solo in the carpool lane.
I'm getting tired of this racing profiling.
Sir, i think i took a wrong turn at uranus
Mr. Jones, keeping up with you has become nearly impossible.
And if you pull something like that again, you're not coming out of jail until those things actually exist.
Sir, are you aware your nuclear accelerator light is out?
Your were doing 7.9 kilometers per second in a 35 mph zone.....
This is a quiet neighborhood. You were doing mach one!
You know you were going 580 in a 55 mile an hour zone.
Sir Elton John? Nice try, but I don't think so.
Sir, are you aware your left jet engine is out?
You passed the stopped school bus.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST STICK TO THE TESLA! ?
Sir, you were really flying along there. Can I see your pilot's license?
Broken indicator light. I'll need you to step out, hand over your keys and swap lives with me.
I'm afraid one of your tail lights is out.
Do you realize you were going warp speed in a zone clearly marked half impulse power?
Were you aware that you were doing 20,000 in a 40 mile per hour zone.
You were doing 400 in a 300 mph zone.
Sir, am I under the influence?
I clocked you at 10 light years above the speed limit!
Were you aware that your left tail light was out?
Do you know how slow you were going?
You're the fifth one this week.
You forgot to signal your turn back there.
I just wanted to see your proof of insurance. and not believe it.
Wanna go two outa three.
That's one helluva tricycle you got there kid.
But officer, my cruise control is set at only Mach 1!
Oh, miles per hour. I though it said MACH per hour --
Sir, this is a low emission State.
NASA's new test pilot program still had a few bugs to work out.
so, that'll be two tickets to the policemen's ball.
Look Pal, I don't care how many parsecs you THINK your were doing, your court date in KANSAS is star date 41299.7.
I don't care if you're Captain America himself. I got you doing 140,000 in a 35 mile zone.
You have two jet; I have eight cylinders. You lose.
I stopped you because I couldn't understand with a car like this, why you were only going 35.
I don't care how many seats there are. This is an HOV lane.
I'm sorry officer. I thought the speed limit was FIVE HUNDRED and fifty-five.
Your sonic boom broke the town noise ordinance.
Dammit, is my blinker out again?
Sir, your North Korean registration has expired.
Yes, "Benny and the Jets" is good but I'd just go with "Rocketman" if I were you.
Sorry, buddy, 'Freed for Speed' is a rural myth.
Runway fees aren't my problem.
Expect to replace every stoplight you just blew through.
Sir, do you know how unfunded you are?
What do you mean "driverless"?
Did you know you were doing forty-five hundred in a thirty-mile-an-hour zone?
no, really, a citizen of space...
You're the fascist pig. You tell me how fast I was going.
Sorry, officer. I thought the speed limit was 17,000 miles per hour.
It's not really a rocket car … think of it as a mobile sparerib smoker.
Sir, has this "car" passed the emissions test?
Do you know how fast you were going back there?
I'm perfectly willing to believe you're John Carter, but I still have to see your license and registration.
Your left-turn light doesn't seem to be working.
I thought this was the access road to Orion's Beltway.
I'm a big fan of yours, so I'll let you off with a warning.
You're not wearing your seat belt...
You were doing mach 3 in a .000000001 mach zone.
I had you at two and a half light years over.
Didn't I give you this already?
I'll let it go, but the tail light's out on the propulsion system.
You're lucky this isn't a school zone. Otherwise I'd have to double the fine to $100.
"The speed for jets is the same as for other vehicles".
Actually, this is only a 2x the speed of sound zone.
" You know why I stopped you, broken left O-Ring.
Sir, you were going mach 4 in a mach 0.07 zone.
Ya, you're getting a ticket, because your tail lights are melted.
Really? A missing taillight?
Lets see your pilots license.
I clocked you at 350 in a 40 zone!
Your choice is to let me off or be mooned.
Hey, buddy - do you know how fast you were going?!? Cuz, uh, my radar couldn't pick you up.
Are you aware that blew a stop sign back there?
Ordinarily, you'd be looking at a pretty expensive ticket for passing through a school zone at 600 mph, but I'm letting you off with a warning because it's Sunday.
You were clocked going 20,000 miles per hour over the limit.
Nor sure if you are aware of this sir, but last month this stretch was rezoned to no longer be ultra-sonic.
Im letting you off with a warning. Just don't let me catch you speeding again.
Yes, I am going to write you a ticket for lightspeeding.
You switched on auto-drive? Ok, I'll just send this ticket to Elon Musk. Have a nice day!
Speeding ticket? Not at 19mph. Two miles back you speared a cow.
Thank you officer, I will fix that tail light.
Do you have a license for this here tricycle?
"I'm giving you a ticket for texting while driving".
I don't care if you're from the future, I just want to know what happened.
Did you see the red light back there?
Why don't we just trade vehicles and pretend this never happened?
I hear the new models can get almost one mile per gallon.
Tractor beams. You know you can't speed near Area 51.
"I clocked 300 miles over the speed limit!
You have two flamed out taillights.
High as a kite by zero hour, 9 a.m.? Oh, it’s gonna be a long, long time, alright.
Hey, aren't you the guy I gave a warning to just last week?
I pulled you over because of a broken tail light.
Sir, it does not matter what the speed limit is on Pluto.
Were you aware you have a taillight out, sir?
I told myself this morning: Robert this is probably going to be another routine boring day.
I'm giving you a ticket for breaking the sound barrier.
Your license tabs have expired.
I pulled you over because you weren’t wearing your helmet.
Where do you think you are, the Moon!
But I slowed to Mach 1 at the school crossing.
I only had it set to Warp Factor 2.
You realize you were going Mach 2 over the speed limit.
Your taillights seem to be burned out.
First, I want to thank you for slowing down enough for me to catch you when you saw my lights ...
I understand, but that doesn't change the fact that you're left taillight is out.
You are missing a tail light.
Yes, even at Warp speed pedestrian compatibility of the front bumper is a concern.
Where's the fireball?
Mars Ain't the kind of place you want to raise your kids, in fact it's cold hell.
You were waiting for me? I got here as fast as I could.
Mr. Musk, I need to see your license and registration.
Goin' just a little heavy on the warp speed, Flash. Tell Doctor Zarkov to meet you at the station.
Sorry. No parking.
Your tail lights are out.
I'll let you off with a warning but you will have to get that tail light fixed.
You were going down the road like a rocket.
Nah, the last guy headed for Canada had a much bigger rocket.
You heard about who won the election, right?
Do you realize you were going 186,282 miles per second over the limit?
After this ticket I suggest you head for Bonneville, Utah.
Your right tail light is broken.
Tell you what. I'll forget that you were 375 over the limit and write you up for the broken taillight. Just a fine, no points.
Now son, you do realize your left taillight is out?
You still are required to signal when you change lanes!
Where's the inferno?
Do you know how horizontal you were going?
I'm going to let you off with a warning this time.
Two glazed and two chocolate iced with sprinkles? Back in a jiffy!
What do I have to do to convince you guys that this is a 25mph zone not the Twilight Zone.?
I guess Pluto is more different than you thought. We drive on the left here.
I'm sorry, sir, but 565 over isn't following the flow of traffic.
You fit a description.
You didn't use your turn signals when ypu broke the sound barrier.
I don't care if you're an honor roll student.
What leads you to believe I was speeding?
Hey bud, where's the inferno?
This is the third time this week, Jack.
Sir, I stopped you because you were driving about 1.2 times the speed of sound over the posted speed limit.
I'm afraid you've exceeded the limit by 10,000 light years,sir!
Your directional is out.
I am just going to give you a warning this time.
It was easy, really. I just upgraded my wienermobile.
I would give you a ticket, but Cuba's not in my jurisdiction.
Is this the New 2017 Dodge challenger model?
No, officer, but I know how fast I hope I was going.
I'm going to let you off with a warning this time.
I'm letting you off with a warning this time. And have that tail light looked at.
Would you like to see my NASA permit or my driver's license?
Do you realize you're doing 200mph in a 30mph zone?
Where is the No Parking sign?
Sorry, officer... I overshot the runway.
Breaking the sound barrier is unlawful on this planet.
The Star Wars Con is in the other direction.
"What, the streets aren't jet legal? Isn't this America?
I am sorry, the minimum speed is 45 .
Whats your rush? I understand that Trump has been elected but he's not being inaugurated till January.
Are you heading to see the Jets play?
Did you know your right brake light is out?
Really, so when did you last see your taillights?
Sure sure but Trump says we now have deport illegal aliens
Excuse me sir, you know you were going 3,000 in a 55?
I pulled you over because you have a tail light that's out.
Sir, did you relize you were going 6500 in a 60 mile per hour zone?
Illegal u-turn.
So, how does the Mrs. like the new Airstream?
Officer, can you give me directions to mars? NASA's been a bit wonky recently.
You took that last turn a bit wide there, Mister.
I'm waiting for the hybrid model.
I'm sorry, officer, I really don't know why you pulled me over.
Mr. Musk, you were going 24,000 miles above the speed limit. Also your left tail light is out.
Engines trouble?
Ethanol?
The radar says you have the"wrong stuff."
You're ticketing me for going too slow?
Spare me the joke about women drivers, pal.
Officer, where can I get some more jet fuel around here?
Son, can I give you my daughter
Sir, you need to obey all traffic signs! You can't just fly through them!
"I'm only citing you for wheels off the roadway today".
Sorry Officer but I swear I just wasn't aware it was out.
God, I hate away games.
The brake light on the driver's side appears to be out.
Do you know why I pulled you over, Mr. Bieber?
You're required to have a license plate on the nose cone.
Just because the EPA allows it doesn't mean I have to.
This can't be any worse than Apple Maps
This one's is for not having an emissions sticker.
This is not what they meant by Moonshot.
It didn't work, Elon — he's still the President.
I'm writing you up for horizontal flying
Sorry, officer. I didn't realize I was flying.
No, Mr. Mach, I don't want to see what this thing can "really" do
186,000 Miles per Second Squared may be the law, but not in these parts, mister!
Did you know that your left tail light is broken?
Get that taillight fixed.
Do you realize you were going 20 times the speed of sound in 55 miles-per-hour zone?
No, sir. The new 1000 mph Federal Speed Limit does not apply in Crawford County.
Trying to outrun that UFO again?
Sir, your break lights are out.
About 778.57959 miles per gallon.
I have you failing to make a complete stop at the wall.
Officer!! How you ever catch me? That thing got a hemi in it?
No Turn signals, but officer I don't make turns.
You spect me to believe that story?
No, it's you're taillight again, Mr. Duncan. I'm gonna give you another stern warning.
I pulled you over because your right-side brake chute is out.
I'm citing you for a broken taillight.
Your temporary license tag has expired.
I had to pull you over since this is not the first time the neighbors complained that you intentionally warped their space-time curvature.
Sir, are you aware that your spaceship is pointed the wrong direction?
Sorry, officer, I thought the speed limit was "c".
Do you have any idea how fast it looked like you were going?
I'm just driving it until my son gets his grades up.
You didn't use your blinker when you changed lanes.
I'll let you off with a warning, but from now on, leave the phone alone!
License, registration and test drive, please.
This is a hybrid. It burns gas, rubber, and oil.
Mr. Musk, do you have a permit for that?
You were clocked at 240 mph, no seat belt visible, and yes we use rocket fuel.
Do you know how slow you were going?
Do you have any idea how fast you were going"? "It couldn't have been more than light
Are you aware of breaking the country lane land speed record back there?
Just a warning, sir - get those tail lights fixed.
Do you have any idea how slow you were going?
You don't know how fast you were going? I guess that means I can write anything I want to on the ticket, huh?
Sir, are you aware you have a tail nozzle out?
Just a simple speed limit, sir. It's not brain surgery, ya' know?
Sorry, sir. I'm afraid 'Wife's having a baby' isn't gonna fly.
Do you know you went through three red lights back there!?
Sorry, wrong skin color.
"A little birdie told me you made an illegal u-turn at 35,000 feet".
Impressive, but here's a fix-it ticket for tail lights, side view mirror and headlights.
Next time you want to go out for a spin, borrow your Dad's' station wagon.
I have you at 200 in a 40, but I'll write it at 42 in a 40, no points, $6000 fine.
I agree, you were´t speeding, but your tail lights are out.
well, where do you think you're going?

What do you think this is boy?! The Bonnyville Salt Flats?

You really should use the GPS.
How did you tail me, officer?
Your right booster is out
I'm sorry, officer, I left my registration on Mars.
I don't want to hear your excuses for why you were going faster than the speed of sound.
Your tail lights are too bright.

I may have to test drive it to see how fast you were going.
What's your hurry, Mister?
Sir, I pulled you over because both of your tail engines were out
"Did you know your Dilithium Crystal turn signal is out on the right?

Officer, when I'm going that fast, I'm not looking at the speedometer.
You were doing 1,250 in a thirty-five.
Sorry pal. Click it or ticket.
Your mom needs you to pick up milk, eggs and a loaf of bread on your way home. And make it snappy.
Do you realize you were doing 250 in a 200 mph zone?
Sir, you have a broken tail light.
Let me guess - you're late for work on Mars.
I see that your name is Elton John, but you still have no right to drive that vehicle as fast as a rocket, man!
Setting aside the speeding violation, your stop and turn lights appear to have burnt out.
just step out of the -er, rocket, please sir
Oh, you're a populist candidate for president... Apologies - carry on...
Not as fast as thought, catcha
I experienced a malfunction and luckily found this nice stretch of road. I´d appreciate an escort to the closest air base.
You sure know how to get a ticket, eh?
....AND, ACCORDING TO YOUR LICENSE, YOUR NAME IS GEORGE...GEORGE JETSON...
I'll let you off with a warning
Do you mind stepping out of your rocket?
No sir, a light-year is a unit of distance, not time. Plus, the signs indicate miles per hour!
Warp drive comes standard in all the new police cruisers!
That's what you get for filling up with ethanol.
Officer, this situation has already been rectified.
Sir, you're under arrest for driving 2 million miles per hour.
Ahhh....So you are merely the SHABBOS GOY hired by the self-driving vehicle.
Do you realize you were going 43, 000 miles an hour?
Let's see now..It seems we discussed the use of the HOV lane and the defective brake light the last time I pulled you over.
Did you know your left indicator is out?
Fancy a spin officer?
Say, is this one of those autonomous vehicles I've been hearing so much about?
Did you know you were doing the speed of sound in a speed of cow zone?
Son, the speed limit is Mach 1, not Warp 1!
Sorry officer, the controls are rather touchy. It's not mine.
Hey, Mr. Live Long and Prosper, you know how fast you were going in this Beta Quadrant?
True, I never would've caught you, Mr. Musk. But too bad about that 3-mile range.

No, I'm pulling you over because your left break light is out.

Sir, I'm going to need to see your astronaut's license. Your tail thruster is out.
I was asleep on the side of the road and this damn thing woke me up.
Sorry, I thought you were black. Now I don't feel right shooting you.
But officer, they did it on YouTube!
This is not how you fast.
You were doing Mach 2 in a 55-mph zone, but I see on your bumper you got a Fraternal Order of Police decal that you picked up on eBay for 12 bucks, so....
Just a warning, sir, your right tail light is out.
Buyer beware. Can't outrun an officer.
Speeding, Officer? I hardly think so!
I stopped you for failure to use your turn signal when switching lanes.
I don't care who was the lowest bidder, you're getting a ticket.
I'm trying to remember the rules around time dilation in school zones.
Sir, I just clocked you at 45 miles a second. I'll let you off with a verbal warning for that, but I'm going to have ticket you for having non-compliant tail-lights.
You missed the speed roadway by half a mile, young man. Here's your ticket for obstructing traffic, speeding, over-the-limit diesel emissions, oversized un-licensed 3-wheel foreign body--and let's see your real-life auto license.
You work for an oil company by any chance?
Radar has you breaking the sound barrier  Speed limit is 45 on this road  I'll let you off with a warning this time but stay under the limit today.
Listen dude I have a hot date Saturday night, this will look cool at the drive-in.
Do you know that one of your tail-lights isn't working?
We can't profile anymore.
Speeding? No. This ticket is for noise pollution. You broke the sound barrier a ways back and woke me up.
Keep it under a hundred next time.
This is a new one, even for the Silicon Valley Police Force.
I'm afraid, Mr. Branson, that you will be too late for the early-bird senior dinner special this evening.
But Officer, I was driving defensively.
I'm President Trump's Secretary of Transportation.
Why do you(italics) think I pulled you over, sir?
So did you know you were breaking the land-speed record?
So let me get this straight. You have a fear of flying, but not for speed. Correct?
Honestly, I haven't had a drop.
Same time tomorrow?
License and registration, please" "Your rear left turn signal is not working
Sir, do you know why I pulled you over?" "Because I look awesome in it.
you know why I stopped you sir?
Sir, Sir, the exhaust from your rumble bee is choking everyone.
Hey, I've never been outrun by a Buick yet!
I clocked you ten over hyperspeed.
What are you growing out of your exhaust, sir?
Your left rear taillight is not working.
Please show me your pilot's license.
We may move a little slow for you out here in the countryside, but that Amish buggy back there didn't appreciate your exhaust fumes in their face.
"Making America great again" is not a valid excuse, sir.
I don't care why NASA suspended your flying license.
Commercial Launch License and Registration Please.

You know why I stopped you, right? Your tail light is broken.
''Ya know, I could stop writing these tickets - if you'd just get that inspection sticker on your wind-shield up-dated..."
Do you have towing insurance?
Do you need a police escort?
Hay kid, where'd you get your license. The other side of Mars.
I got the stealth package, no way this holds up in court.
So you say Elon let you borrow it for the day?
Did I just see you turning down here, sir? Last I checked that sign back there said left turns only.
I'll give you a warning this time. You were doing only 24,550.
I'm sorry, President-elect Trump, but you can't play with your new toys in the middle of America.
License and registration. And before you even ask, you were weaving.
Do you know how fast you were going? My radar gun clocks out at the speed of sound.
'Did Trump plan this too?"
Your left taillight isn't working.
Pull over Buddy "this is not Cape Canaveral"
Guess I better call the Men in Black!
Okay, I need to see your license and road jet permit, Sir.
Son, a PBA card isn't gonna help.
I pulled you over because of your race.
Oh no, officer, it's a popcorn maker.
I'm citing you for 'Immolation of Red Light'
You were going way over the 2,000 mile per hour speed limit.
My other vehicle is a sensible station wagon.
On my planet we don't require a license.
So...your "George Jetson" of "Spacely Sprockets!" Hmm
There's a limit, Sir, as to how many times you can be found stationary along the main drag, in the early hours of Saturday morning, asking pedestrians whether they might be interested in watching you open-up!
Sir, your smog certificate has expired.
I'm cutting you a break as I am writing you up for only Mach 2 over the speed limit.
My GPS is on the blink Sir
OK, wise guy, let's see your license and registration. And for the record, it was a rhetorical question. It was quite obvious that the fire was coming out of your exhaust ports.
I think this new Tesla may not be the car for you.
I sense this a troubled place. Take me to your leader.
Your Buck Rogers Rocket Ranger membership lapsed long ago.
Sir, do you realize that you were going march 1.52 over the speed limit?
Do not let my appearance deceive you. I was below the speed limit, I assure you.
You were going 500 in a 45 zone, rocketman.
I clocked you going 2 mph over the current land speed record. Congratulations. Now can you please step out of the vehicle and put your hands behind your back.
Sir, are you aware that one of your taillights is broken?
Are you under any medication?
Do you know how many Mach you were driving?
I see you have quite a driving record.
You're driving too slowly for speed limit.
Mr. Busey, I don't care what the presidet-elect says. You can't drive this on the street.
Yes I'll tell you what is wrong.Your biofuel is an invasive species in this state.
Your "life at the speed of sound" Snapchat was a dead giveaway.
there’s a minimum speed of 45 miles per hour on this highway.
Nice mash-up, Mr. Musk.
... and your tail light's burned out.
Yes officer, My wife ran off with a cop and I thought he was bringing her back.
No, your exhaust is NOT a hoax!
Why did the chicken cross the road?
Did you know your left tail light is out?
Bonneville is a salt flat, not a rural lane!
There are cops here?! This is not how Mars was advertised.
I have a permit for this.
And this is your real name, Chuck Jaegermeister?
You almost achieved escape velocity!
I clocked you going past the speed of sound.
Do you know how to get this out of second?
This is the third time this week, Bill. It may not have had much mileage on it but I think it was a bad choice for a commuter car.
Sir, would you mind certifying that my cruiser reached 200 mph?
Ok ...registration... driver's ID... license to bear arms..all set...have a good day!
Did it hurt when you fell from heaven?
Look, the radar couldn't keep up, but here's a ticket for speeding..
you're going mach 3 in a mach 2 zone.
Of course I'm not profiling you, but I detect a hint of a Russian accent.
Officer, my license expires on Jan 16, 2070.
Did you know that your left tail light is out?
Can you turn down your Elton John, Sir?
Yep, next step is driverless operation.
It doesn't matter where you came from. Idling on a country road is subject to a fine.
I stopped you because your taillights are both burned out.
'Whad I do that was wrong, officer?' You're kidding me, right? The law requires a safety cap for sharp nosecones and your's is missing. People could get seriously hurt.
85 in a 55-mile zone? What planet do ya think you're on?
I'll need your license and proof of insurance please...
Your inspection sticker has expired. And FYI, looks like your ethanol has gone to seed. You might want to take care of that.
See, if you're looking to break the land speed record, please don't do it on the interstate.
Do you have any idea how fast you were going? Sorry, that's classified.
You know you were going 4000 in a 40 zone didn't, you
You were doing 400 through the school zone.
The problem, sir, is that your tail light is not working.
I suggest you play "Fly Me to the Moon" rather than "Pink Cadillac"
Sir, did you know you have a busted tail light?
I'm giving you a warning for pulling over.
You have got to be careful with that pecker. It could hurt someone.
I pulled you over for a broken taillight.
"Sorry Mr. Musk, you were going 1,200 mph in a 55mph zone".
Sir, this is neither Florida nor the road to Cape Canaveral.
How did you pass inspection? An afterburner isn't an acceptable substitute for tail-lights.
I don't care what your first officer told you, Mister "Kirk" is it ? The posted limit here is Warp Factor 2, no exceptions.
You've been idling for more than a minute.
Got any tips on how to break the barrier between us cops and the community?
We don't have BELOW the radar.
This is one small step for a cop; one giant leap for cop-kind!
Sorry, I have to ticket you for brake light failure.
You're overdue for a smog check.
Could I take it for a spin?
This is the second time Kevin. Yield signs are for your safety too.
You failed to yield.
I'm going to need some I.D., Mr. Branson.
May I see your license, proof of insurance and Space Launch System registration please?
Your tail lights aren't working. License and registration please.
You were going too slow on this highway.
In addition of not complying with the federal emissions regulations per FSH.006, I also pulled you over to put in a good word for me at the mothership. I don't like it here anymore.
Do you know how fast you were going? Please answer in Machs.
I'm pulling you over for a busted tail light.
My other car is a Mercedes
You wouldn't believe how cheap a secondhand Tesla X goes for these days.
"I'm booking you for trespassing and emissions.
Excuse me Obi-Wan, but I do need to see your identification.
You're wasting my time, buddy. Why were you only going 20 miles over the speed limit?
High school science fair, eh? Even so, that's too fast for a school zone.
Good afternoon officer. I trust you noticed the decal showing my support for the windows and orphans?
"Fired up - ready to go!" was the last guy!
I'll need to see your intergallactic drivers license please.
'Your intergalactic license has expired'
I don't know much about light-speed sir, but around here, the speed limit is 55.
Six hundred miles per hour? Impossible! I haven't been gone that long!
Ummmm, yeah, I'd say a little fast; I got you going 20,000 in a 45 zone.
Were you aware y our left rear tail light is out?
Sir, I clocked you at 83,770 mph in a 70 zone, and both your taillights have burned out...
I don't care that the dealer said it would go like a rocket sled.
I don't care if you're a robot. The law required a seatbelt.
You blew right by that other rocket car going 600 miles per hour.
"Sorry, officer--I guess I missed the "ONE WAY DO NOT ENTER" sign.
That's hypocritical - you must have been speeding just as much.
I don't care if you do have a plutonium foot, this is a school zone, buddy!
Is there a problem with my tail lights?
We drive on the right side, Mr. Von Braun.
Sully, didn't you get enough in NYC?
Officer, I crossed the border as soon as I could.
Don't give me that 'late for church' malarkey.
Officer, I wasn't speeding. It's the car, and it make me look fast.
Your taillight is burned out and so is mine.
Mister, I don't know where you're from but there's a phallic limit in this county.
On top of everything, you failed to signal two quasars ago
Is it really necessary to have bean stalks sprouting from your exhaust pipes, Jack?
Gee officer, mind if I ask what kind of engine ya got in that car?
Could I see your smog certificate, sir?
Okay Roger Ramjet, let me see your license and insurance policy that covers rocket-powered vehicles.
So you're sure my speed was the only problem?
Your left turn signal isn't working.
Sir, Facebook may well have reported higher speed restrictions, but we've heard no such news on Fox.
Is your name really Sonic Boom?
My radar clocked you doing 300 in a 30 mph zone.
You think you got an engine in this thing? Come ride in my cop car.
Officer, I thought the sign read 170 not 70...my bad.
You made an illegal UV-turn back there.
Actually, radio waves travel at the speed of light, which is faster than the speed of sound.
"You've helped me make my quota 6 months early!" - Officer who patrols on an Air Force base
Well Sir! It would appear the yoke is on you . . . a steering wheel is a steering wheel until proven otherwise!
You were doing 16 000 in a 90 km an hour zone sir.
Being late for work is no excuse to speed.
License and voter's registration, as if I have to ask.
Do you have any idea how fast you were going? You were FLYING.
Where's the fire, chief?
Sir, the reason I pulled you over is your rear thruster was blowing dirty.
Do you realize you were doing 600 in a 35 mph zone?
... no registration and not helmet. That should do it.
Oh, aren't I on the number 2 runway, officer?
Excuse me sir. Did you know that your left taillight was broken?
We can't let you fly with the speed of light, sir
No, Kubrick did not fake that stop sign.
Young Musk, for the last time, fix that tail light
And how do you spell Ivanka I?
That sonic boom just got you the sonic boot.
TV show pilot or pilot pilot?
No,you were drinking a pumpkin spice grande latte without a permit.
Do you know that you went by me just like a rocket!
All this science I don't understand. It's just my job five days a week.
OK, Flash Gordon, where do you think you're going?
Go to this address and tell my wife to call me.
Sir, did you know that your passenger side tail light is out? Oh, and you skewered the bejeezus out of Mrs. Perkins back there a spell.
While that WAS a fast getaway after robbing that Quik-e-Mart, I can hit 20,000 miles an hour, too.
I don't care if you are late to your grandma's 90th birthday!
No not speeding, loose license plate.
I got you going 17,010 in a 17,000 zone.
License, registration and Blue Chips, please.
No Officor, i dom't know why you stopped me. Just kidding
I have a bad sense of direction, thought it was set for up?
You were going 120 miles over the speed limit.
Didn't you read the sign? This is a no parking zone!
I heard you just chased red ones.
Actually, it's just that your tail light is out.
Take your time, son. That tunnel up there isn't going anywhere.
Just what makes you think this was the rocket car you saw speeding?
I'm sorry sir, but you were violating the minimum speed limit on this road.
Do you have any idea how slow you were going?
Yes, geosynchronous -- and down on the surface that means 'staying put'. You know, like in a garage.
Sir, I clocked you at 25 MPH under the minimum speed limit.
No, I’m more of a Giants fan.
.....GPS on the fritz....must have made a wrong turn in Albuquerque
"Your vehicle dose not have a license plate number.
Sir, it's time to leave the capsule, if you dare.
Houston, we have a problem with one of your officers..
I’d let you off with just a warning, except for my hunch that you probably can’t help yourself.
Your lithium-ion battery caught fire.
Your turn signal isn't working
No, you weren’t speeding; your left brake light has burned out.
I didn't know I even needed taillights on this thing!
You need a NASA Drivers License for this vehicle.
Your air intake just sucked up the school marm.
Officer, I suppose we can't settle this with a Patrolmen's Benevolent Association donation - can we?
Sure automatic drive would have been more careful but...
I didn't see a turn signal at the last intersection.
You gave your wife a gym membership for Christmas? Oh, carry on..
It's a 30 MILES PER HOUR limit - not Mach, Mac!
So...you just bought it and you couldn't remember which one was the brake pedal...is that right?
How do I know it was the speed of sound? I was right behind you the whole time, buddy.
Sir, this highway only allows gasoline or diesel powered vehicles.
Your radio was being played too loudly.
Whose lawn are you going to mow today?
I'm with the Speed Enforced by Aircraft division, ground patrol. Turns out, we are real.
Sir, the Minimum Speed on this Highway is 45 mph!
You're getting a ticket for having no muffler.............
Yes, I am surprised I caught up with you, but Donald Trump was elected recently and that shows anything is possible.
Sir, president Trump did not say it was 'OK to drive rocket cars'.
How am I supposed to get it back to the dealer? I didn't even put it in second gear yet.
Would you accept ten bucks for a ride in that thing for about an hour?
This Olds rocket?
Yep! You and Bugs both should have turned left at Albuquerque! I wrote him up last week.
Rocket science doesn't do the trick either what's next google drive?
Say, aren't you Han Solo?
License and registration, please, Mr. Hagar.
Mach 1?
Underage and expired Kryptonian plates.
I’m giving you a warning, but it’s time to get a smog check.
Thanks for staying earthbound
Wrong city. This is Moscow, Pennsylvania.
Kind of hypocritical if you ask me, Mr. Musk....
I don't care if you work for Donald Trump. He's not president yet.
I know, but this is I know, but this is Amish Country.
This is quite a Honda you have here.
Mr. Trump, may I see your tax returns, er, I mean, your drivers license ?
Sir, I don't care if it's NASA surplus, orbital speed is illegal on this road.
To be completely honest, Mr. Jones, I have to meet the quota of summonses to drivers of road rockets.
I meant for you to catch me!
Please ask Santa to give us a peace-loving President.
I'm not gonna tell you again: your taillight's out.
Are you sure that you calibrated your radar right?
Just so you know, officer, I am recording this conversation.
Well, I agree you've fixed your taillight issue.
Sully, didn't you get enough in NYC?
You were doing 627 in a 55 zone with 'Donald Trump hair.'
We've been getting complaints of a UDO.
In this case, I'd say you haven't been drinking enough...
Marshmallows, hot dogs, whatever. It's still littering.
Exactly, Dr. Heisenberg. But where are we?
Your left booster novel is out
Your emissions exceed the legal limit!
You were going over 5,000 miles an hour just to make an appointment with a podiatrist?
I gave you a warning last time, sir. You really need to fix that busted tail light.
I'll have to signal the hotline for a make and body type.
White lives matter.
I smell alcohol. Please step out of the vehicle, sir.
Sorry... an orange fireball of exhaust doesn't count as a taillight!
Sir did you realize you were going at light speed in a 50 mph zone?
So, whatta you got under the hood of this thing?
Sir, please return to the Space Station. Your "car" is blocking my way.
Sir, there is a minimum speed limit of 40 MPH on this highway.
I said which way to the Bonneville Salt Flats?
You may have a faster machine but I learned to drive fast from watching the Dukes of Hazard!
OK, you captured me. But I didn't know she was a Virgin Atlantic.
Officer, didn't you hear? SpaceX and Tesla merged.
...and you didn´t know that Cannoball Run has gone out of style ...
...and this one is for actually pulling over!
I know the Mars immigration website crashed, sir- but you can't just go. I have to give you a ticket.
I know what you must be thinking...
Design flaw?? That cruiser back there get 23 MPG and I still caught you.
When I yelled 'pullover', I wasn't referring to your sweater, I know it's a cardigan.
Sir, did you know you were going faster than the speed of light?
Your tail light's busted
That ticket amount's going to send my wife to the moon.
I'm sorry, officer, there are no posted speed limits on Cyber-Monday.
They're gonna put you a way for a long, long time.
So you had this flameout at a bar tonight?
So, you wanna get there "before fuel skyrockets" right? Nice try.
You were supposed to circle the area twice before landing.
Do you know why I pulled you over? I don't know sir but whatever it was I Apollogize.
You can't drive 1,055.
Yes, I agree that TIME IS MONEY, but McDonalds probably has other employees on hand to, "Drop some fries".
I only pulled you over because we now have quotas to pull over white people, for a change.
Buddy, you are required to have both "Oversize" and "Overpower" tags.
I need your alien identity card. The space barrier is still under construction.
Greetings. You've made an emergency landing in flyover country.
"This license, only entitles you, to drive on the other side of the fence
Left tail light is broken...get it fixed.
It's a creature comfort to remind me of home once I'm settled in north of the border.
Didn't you see that red Mustang fly right by me?
No, you are not in Mars!
It's not just for violations. How'd you clear all those alt-right turns?
Musk, Musk, Musk.
You're on a 2016 space oddity?
I usually take the interplanetary freeway but I thought I would blow out the cobs today.
Officer, all astronauts carry pipes; how do you think Buzz Aldrin got his name!
Was it because a tail light was out?
Sorry, Bud, Bonneville's in Utah.
I'm with NASA and Elon Musk said I could take it out for a test drive.
Hey, buddy, people with the same name as the cartoonist can't drive in this contest.
You've got a burnt-out tail light.
This is not a sanctuary city. ICE should be arriving soon.
Only Eco-Friendly Vehicles Allowed.
Do you realize your tail light is out, Mr. Musk?
You probably didn't realize Sir, but you were going 180 in a 30 mile an hour zone.
We have helmet laws in these parts for a vehicle like yours...
Holy cow man, that's a pretty big steering wheel you have there.
Do you know how fast you were going?
You got a license to fly this thing, sir?
Yes sir you were speeding and as you can tell, the speed of light showed up early this morning.
As it turns out, finding 3 million to deport is harder than it seems. So, we expanded our definition of "alien".
Usually I ask if you know why I pulled you over, but now I am asking are you from this world as we know it?
Your tailpipes are blocking my dashcam buddy, get out of the rocket.
You singed back at Camry at the intersection.
I had you clocked at c squared
You've got a tail light out.
That witch you ran over wants her hat back.
NASA Used Vehicle Sales may have told you that it was easily adaptable, but it's still against the law to drive it on our roads!
Burned out that fuse RocketMan?
On this highway, the Kessel Run takes more than 12 parsecs
May I see your pilot's license?
I'm sorry officer...I'm not a rocket scientist.
May I ask you where you needed to go in such a hurry?
Blue lives matter?
Unit 121, 10-38 on the interstate. Unless 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 is a thing?
Ok Hotshot! Give me your "License and Registration"
Up
This is not the rocket car you are looking for.
Yes, this is an Advanced Speeding ticket. After you take off, we don't know where you will end up!
You say you noticed it crept above Mach 3 after going over that last rise and were already slowing down?
Sorry if I got soot on your windshield, Officer.
Good morning, Wing Commander. Having trouble taking off?
Immigration papers and criminal history, please.
It's impossible to make the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs, Mr. Spielberg.
I don't think that I've ever seen a driver's license from Bonneville before
It may look good officer, but when you can only do a third of a mile with a full tank the novelty soon wears off.
im sorry to have pulled you over, sir. your rocket was going so fast i thought you were black.
Green Card and Party Alliance, sir?
What is the big hurry Sir?
I stopped you for shooting the moon.
I don't care that President Trump just pressed the button.
But, officer, this is the new super-sonic environmentally-friendly electric car!
So, um, do you know how fast you were going?
Your tail's alight
"What do you mean I need a truck license"?
Do you know how fast you were breaking the sound barrier?
Sorry officer. I thought this was my imaginary car
Your car officer can almost reach the speed of sound.
I'll have a cheeseburger, fries, and chocolate milk shake, sir...and make it fast.
You Elites aren't welcome around here.
Looks like someone's late for the space race.
I understand your point. However, though it may have started from a Volkswagen Bug, I don't think it's fair to say you couldn't have been speeding.
Where you goin' in a hurry?
I pulled you over because this is a "no rear rocket blaster zone".
Hey, it's just a big league SUV.
Iter-galactic license and title, please. Are you facing burn-out, sir?
Is that a record?
You do recognize that if you were Neil deGrasse Tyson, I would have shot you by now.
Would you believe Airbnb?
It's for doing 20 in a 60
Speeding? no, just a broken tail light.
Sorry sir, my GPS told me to do a U-turn at Uranus.
So, you're having your first kid—license and registration please.
I clocked you at Mach 3.5 over the speed of light limit!
Sorry, I could not tell you were wearing your seat belt at 240 mph.
As this is your first offense, I'm sure the DA will dismiss this speeding ticket for going 600 mph in a 30 mph zone, in exchange for your pleading guilty to a defective heat shield.
I'm afraid it is rocket science, sir, when you broke the sound the barrier, not to mention all the glass doors and windows, when you came roaring through our quiet town.
Do you know why I pulled you over, sir? Your right afterburner is burned out.
Dealer told me about 'turbo' mode. Frankly, I had no idea!
It's not my problem if this delivery service is only in beta.
Listen buddy, it won't work, it will be a YUGE wall
Oh yeah? My nickname is "Flash", too!
Can't park here--it's a construction site--they're extending the Second Avenue subway--should be finished in the next 20 years.
Now I'm gonna let you off with a warning just this once. But next time I catch you 847 MPH over the speed limit I'm gonna have to write that ticket son.
No I wasn't speeding, and yes, let's test the paint job on your cruiser.
For sure you broke the record for the lamest excuse, sir."
Illegal mufflers, Sir.
Sir, catching the McDonald's breakfast is no excuse.
Registration,please.
Sorry officer, I must have taken a wrong turn at Saturn.
Sir, this NASA membership card is not an acceptable form of identification.
You were doing 150 in a 50 mile per hour zone
Hey, I'm sorry to startle you but what planet-ship did you get your vehicle?
Hey officer, do you where the nearest gas station is
The speed limit around here is Mach 1.
I'm going to have to cite you for texting while driving.
We don't let just anybody break the sound barrier in Iowa!
I can't believe you expected to liftoff at 65 miles per hour and besides you have a large tail light out.
Sir, a pilot's diploma from NASA and a certificate from Space Station Mir is not proper license and registration
Do you think breaking the sound barrier is a tad more more than 55 mph?
Well,son, "Bonneville" and "accept destination" will cause a heap of trouble when you skip the part about "Utah".
5:52 PM (23 minutes ago)  "No I did NOT see that red light 18,000 miles ago!" "No I did NOT see that red light 18,000 miles ago!"
You were doing 655 in a 25. What's your hurry?
What a ticket for no rear view mirrors? Elon Musk will hear form me!!
I'm going to have to ask you to step out of the vehicle, Mr. Must. It's MUSK, M-U-S-K, MUSK!
Officer, I could have sworn that tail light was working just yesterday.
WAY too slow.
Nice vehicle. How much did it cost?
No catalytic converter? You get a ticket.
"I got you going 300 in a 30 miles per hour zone; maybe you misread the sign".
Sorry, officer. I couldn't find the keys to my Rambler.
I don't believe vehicle registration is subject to relativistic concerns...
I don't care if you're Eldon Musk, you're still getting a ticket.
But if I stick to the speed limit I'll never get airborne!
This isn't for speeding, bud. It's for only one operational headlight.
Sorry officer, I didn't realize my speedometer is in light years.
Look, Lady. Didnt you see that sign back there saying there's a minimum speed of 20 miles an hour, except for farm vehicles?
"I didn't realize I picked up speed downhill" is not a valid excuse here.
I assure you officer, I am not Adam West.
I got you going 25 mph in a 65 mph zone.
Sir, I clocked you at 15 MPH over the limit.
I don't card what planet you're from!
I'm sorry officer, I didn't know I couldn't do that.
Not drinking? I could smell the fumes a mile away!
Your tags expire in 3...2...1...
I'm going to let you off with a warning this time sir-but please keep your speed below the speed of sound in the fute
I'm going to have to ask you to follow me to the moon
Sorry, I was so into a song on the radio that I lost track of my speed.
Funny you should ask. It's the latest Prius Interceptor model.
I get pull over and pull down mixed up!
767 miles per hour and you still didn't hear me? I don't think so.
No, you were going too slow.
I'm the new Uber SpaceX-- just $3 more per ride!
I've pulled you over for flying to low
Hey buddy.... Mrs. Philips' dog Sparky ran away Thursday night, have you seen him?
Officer I swear the uranium you found isn't mine! I don't know how it got there! I would never use that!
What's a nice officer like you doing out here on a lonely country road?
I don't really care that you are on I don't really care that you're on your way to Canada!
Sorry Officer, I really 'ought to fix that tail light.
I'm going to take a selfie...the court will be intrigued by this DUI...
We'd have snow it weren't for guys like you and those bun warmers of yours.
But officer, I was only 1 Mach over the limit!
Sir, the sign back there says that the minimum speed is 30 miles per hour.
gotta get that emissions sticker current my friend.
I've got a hot alien chick in the back. Maybe we could compromise?
It is no excuse that the thrust of your engines exceeds the speed limit.
How fast do you think you were going?
I am ticketing you, sir, because your tomato stalks are over the height limit!
So you're telling me that this is what people actually meant when they said 'Y2K'?
Sir, you were clocked doing 1000 mph in a 45 mph zone, license and registration please.
Your T5P7-XQ83-2PRZ-3UQ9 taillight is out.
Think you can slow this thing down to 500 MPH?
Officer, my wife left me and I thought you were bringing her back.
License and registration please.
Are you keeping any large amounts of cash in your vehicle?
Really, officer, zooming is such a kick, climb on in.
This might actually raise Space-X's value.
This is the Bonneville GRASS Flats.
This week we're profiling rich white speeders!
I'll issue a warning; but, remember the the pilot is always the first to the scene of the accident.
Is there a problem officer?' "Yes! Do you know how many carbon fuels you were releasing into the atmosphere?
Do you think I really need a license to drive this thing?
Sir, do you realize you were going 684.665miles per hour over the posted speed limit?
It's not rocket science. You were doing 70 in a 45 mile-an-hour zone.
Got you on the red light camera.
Are you aware there are beanstalks growing out of your tailpipes?
But officer, I was above the speed limit!
Did you not see the frog hitchhiking back there? You flew by him.
That's not the cosmos I'm talking about, sir.
"Now is a goof time for you to request that Scottie beam you up". I am submitting this caption of behalf of my co-worker, Mr. Glenn Reeves of Jacksonville, FL
Did you know you have a broken tail light?
"O -Boy that was fast. Please Please Please tell me I broke the record officer"!!
Don't you think the color is a little unnecessary.
I stopped you because one of your tail lights is out.
Ok, we'll leave it at a warning this time...
I understand, sir, but do you know what the speed limit is?
Whoa what's the rush buddy?Gotcha at Mach 2 in school zone
Big deal. My squad car redlines at Mach 2
Have you been drinking young man?
I though there was enough space
When was your last smog check?
Good news: your wheels weren't actually on the ground, so no ticket. Bad news: you therefore don't qualify for a land speed record.
Radar? My Stealth option must be on the Fritz.
For Christ Sake sir, you just broke the land-speed record!
Sir, Mach 25 is not the same as 25 miles per hour.
Mr. Gambini had thought, wrongly, that this trip through rural Alabama would be different.
I'm in Trump's cabinet- Secretary of Speed
This is not a runway; it's a county road.
I flamed out trying to make America Great Again
No, your registration expired last month.
I thought it meant "mach 25"!
No ticket if your name is Chris Hadfield.
One of your Rolls Royce Trent 1000XWB jet engines is losing power.
You know how fast you were going back there, buddy?
Officer: "Sir, are you out of your mind?" Man: "No, I'm out of this world."
We clocked you doing mach 5 in a mach 1 zone.
Gee Officer, I didn't bring my license along on this trip and you'll have to contact NASA for the registration.
The noise emitted by your vehicle exceeded the permitted limit.
NASA told us to be on the look out for you, you know you were doing about 1500 miles an hour in a 40, preciate your respect for the Blue light !
Failure to signal before turning
This license is expired.
But officer, I can't see what's up ahead of me until I pass it!
It's a shame you can never floor this baby.
I was wondering if I could re-heat my coffee and cinnamon roll in your exhaust pipe.
Do you realize you were doing Mach 2 in a Mach 1 zone?
It's back to the drawing board Carl...I caught up with the cruiser again.
Ya, but what is the speed limit in light years?
Aside from speeding, you were "darting" in and out of traffic.
When was your last smog check?
Officer, I signaled before I jumped past light speed. If you get back in your car and watch, you'll see.
Sorry officer, I didn't see more than usual flashing red light behind me.
Sorry, the tinted window threw off my profile checker.
No Mr. Musk, this is not Mars
But I wasn't driving. " Go ahead and Google it.
Are you ready for the grand finale?
Son, don't give me that Sammy Hagar "I can't drive 55" bullshit...
No sir, you weren't speeding. But your left tail light is out and I'm going to need to give you a written warning.
I am only issuing a warning this time, but after January 20th it will be a felony for anyone to drive a vehicle YUGER! more FABULOUS or FANTASTIC than President Trump.
But my girlfriend said her parents weren't home.
Black Friday does this to me every year. Never heard of an acute 'beat the crowd' syndrome?!
I could've seen you texting from space.
You were going past the speed of sound when the limit was 55 mph. Thank God, it was not a school zone. I would have to charge you double.
It's really hard to keep this thing under the speed of sound. But I did and so you caught me.
Sir..I think MACH 5 is a little bit above the posted Speed Limit
Do realize you were doing 36,373 miles per hour in a 25 mile an hour zone?
"I've been waiting for a speed merchant like you." " Sorry to keep you waiting Officer I got here as fast as I could".
what kind of gas mileage do you get
I'm afraid I need to confiscate your vehicle.
I'm sorry officer. Waze told me to go straight.
So...let's go over your plane ticket.
Look, Mac, I don't care if you're late for an interview for NASA administrator at Trump Tower. You're still getting a ticket!
Who knew that we couldn't fly over a restricted area
No sir, you're just outside the Bonneville city limits.
Stupid JEDI mind tricks don't work on me.................................Mr Chewbaca, Sir!
No, no. You're not moving fast enough. After all this is Mars
I was wondering how many parsecs this gets to a gallon?
Sorry officer, I don't happen to have my insurance card with me. There's no glove box for it.
...but officer I really am in a hurry, brain surgery is not rocket science!
Good day Mr. Branson, we've been through this before.... license and registration.
I'M STOPPING YOU FOR A BROKEN TAIL LIGHT
I, too, had to visit my in-laws too for the holiday.
Step outside, please.
May I see your over length permit ?
Lady, do you know how fast you were going through the last county?
Are you under the influence: because this a pretty big influence.
No, that does not count as a tail light
We're on our way to Burning Man. All we have in here is water and led lights.
I don't care if Mr. Trump tweets me with your excuse.
Your speed was fine bud, but that sharp thing at the front is a big problem down a ways in Balloon Valley.
Do you know how fast you were going back there?
I'm also surprised that the Snapchat data filter can reach Mach 1...
They said you might run out of fuel in our state.
Your left break light is out. That's a $50 fine.
Your brake light is busted on your parachute.
Speeding? Who said anything about speeding? There, I gotcha now!
I should see her in overdrive ? , really ?
No sir, you will reach escape velocity in my county!
I didn't know this was a school zone!
Forty-five is the posted speed, clocked you at Mach 3.
The Speed Limit is 65.
There are other ways to protest, Mr. Clinton.
I don't care if this is a spy plane. Radar avoidance equipment is illegal in this state.
Beep beep. No english, Beep beep...
I'm sure you've heard this before, but...
Re-entry? I don't know nothin' about that, but you ran 269 red lights. License and registration, please.
I don’t know about no sound barriers, but you ain’t breakin’ nothin’ in my town.
There are limits to speed? On my Planet....
Might you be aware of the two sharp S curves just up ahead?
I was told by the dealer that I had to clean out the carborator from time to time.
The car brake lights are broken
Whose crazy idea was it to put speed limits on rockets?
License, registration and passport, please.
Sir, but I was flying in the air instead of running on the road.
Sir, I'm not buying that Cape Canaveral excuse.
Sorry Officer, I thought the sign indicated 55 light years per hour.
As you can plainly see, Officer, rocket surgery is not just a mixed metaphor.
Yeah, well if you can't remember which planet, your license might tell us something.
Justin I will have to send you back to jail for drag racing again.
