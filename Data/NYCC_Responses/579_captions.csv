The truth is you came from a box of free kittens.
Get over yourself... it was ONE mouse!
Our estate planner wants to know if you would like your inheritance in a lump sum or spread out over nine lives.
He does know the dog got more votes, right?
It doesn't mean you won't still be royalty. It just means there will be no heir.
The taxidermist really captured his personality.
You see, "reigning" cats and dogs can have two different meanings ...
We're sorry we didn't think about your line of succession before we...you know.
No, your majesty, eating the canaries was not what we meant when we asked you to stop the tweeting.
he just got his resuslts from ancestry.com
Whatever, he still shits in a box.
After legalizing catnip, nothing else seems important to him
A royal heir? Nice try, but you're still getting neutered.
This is a bit awkward, Sire, but the parakeet is missing.
Why is it always the orange ones with delusions of grandeur?
We're just saying, it might be tough to rule the world when you sleep for 12 hours a day
Even if he's deposed, I'm sure he'll land on his feet.
I know the Egyptians used to worship them, but you're from the Bronx.
YOU'RE the one who wanted to call him Donald!
Maybe children would be easier.
He's overcompensating for his tiny claws.
I wanted a rescue, but all they had was an exile.
Ok, I'll say it--the emperor has no claws.
We'd prefer you 'think' inside the box.
Sorry, but we had to remove your family jewels.
We never should have let him watch the Lion King.
No, we're not changing the name of your litter box to Mar-a-Gato.
Let’s go back to dry food.
I know you don't want to move, but do you think you could just check that you're not sitting on the remote?
He clawed his way to the top.
I know we are supposed to fight over pets when we divorce, but you can have him.
We shouldn't have named him Donald
This is why no one names a cat Rex.
It could be worse. He could think he's the president.
The dog wants to know if he can come back in.
What do you mean you've had the dog beheaded?
At three you have the Royal Scratching Post. At four the Ball of Twine arrives...
OK then, we'll build a moat and have the dog pay for it.
He said he still wants to build a scratching post and have us pay for it.
...........but over time, Fluffy, the Egyptians realized that their cats weren't gods
Yes Leo,you're King. But we own the can opener
He's wondering what happened to the royal jewels.
We decided we are actually dog people.
I just worry we spoil him sometimes.
Ok, let's go over this again. The Lion King was a completely different kind of cat.
Sometimes he wants to execute Jacobites, but we just distract him with string.
I don't want to be the one to tell him we're getting a dog.
The vet says she's got affluenza.
You just told him what "fixed" really means?
Try to remember where you last were when you were wearing the boots.
We should have listened to the people at the shelter.
Lazy, overweight and an inexperienced leader. Sounds vaguely familiar.
Well, we've requested an audience with you today, Your Highness, to ask you to stop urinating on the couch.
Don't let them get to you. It's all fake mews.
It's time to go out and do something with your nine lives
Perhaps having children would have been easier
The taxidermy really captured his essence.
Next time, let's get a taxidermist who's a little less whimsical.
Trump tried to grab him.
His videos bought this house. He deserves a little respect.
Sorry your highness, but I think you can handle licking yourself on your own.
C'mon, Bob, we both let this happen.
This is the 8th cat we've named Henry
His shrimp was limp.
We were hoping that maybe we could sleep on the bed tonight?
We think you can lick your own butt.
I'm so glad this is the final season of Game of Thrones.
You don't think we're spoiling him, do you?
I spoke with the therapist again today and she actually had the nerve to say the problem might be us.
We want to get a dog.
But "Le Chat, C'est Moi" can't be your only policy.
Cats have nine lives, not eight wives.
What does he mean by, "Meow is the winter of our discontent."?
We said castration, not coronation.
Le chat, c'est moi.
Tsk Tsk. Puss in Booze, and drunk again.
Worst case scenario: He reigns for the whole four years.
We've been seeing a lot more animals in leadership positions ever since that orangutan was elected President.
I like the way it fits right over the catbox.
Get a grip Arthur, your father was a Chicago cat named Three Toes and your mother was a Persian stripper...
Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown and gags up hair balls.
Look, there will be no heir. Remember that doctor's visit?
You ARE the greatest cat who ever lived and you have the biggest paws.
You know you're becoming a royal pain in the ass.
You shouldn't have named him Clawdius.
Do you think we are spoiling him?
He's a rescue from Trump Tower.
We're "cat people," but not "the' cat's people.
Maybe just marking your territory is enough.
I miss Rover and his democratic socialist platform.
The shelter called. They found your scepter.
My other throne is a litter box.
I'm sorry but you just can't pardon yourself for going on the rug.
It's his Trump imitation.
One viral video and suddenly he thinks his litter doesn't stink.
Not what you expect from a rescue cat.
Dogs have masters. Cats have subjects.
We feel like the Fancy Feast has gone to your head.
We may have crossed the line between pampering and enabling.
You may think you're royal, but I've got the can opener.
He got his DNA test results back today.
It's too much. He's gone through 14 of my house plants, eight catnip toys and now three Communication directors.
He still thinks he won the popular vote.
Well Donald, that's what you get when you tell a genie that you want some "Royal Pussy".
I think we should cut back on the fancy feast.
I told the taxidermist that I wanted him to look majestic.
Nothing was too good for her – EVERYTHING WAS !!!
Sometimes the mice just win.
Did your mother say when she'd be back to pick him up?
This is the last time we're cat sitting
As you start your 2nd life, we got a companion pet - a pit-bull.
He's been like this since I cancelled his Twitter account.
Please don't look so sad; the package clearly stated that the orb and scepter were being shipped separately.
I liked it better when he was an "outside" cat.
Trumpy what's wrong?
You gotta admit, it's a lot better than his "Brando" stage.
I liked him more when HE brought US mice.
He's been like this since Brexit.
He wants nine wives, too.
He's bored. Get your mouse costume out.
Well yeah, it's definitely a little troubling, but I'm pretty sure our emperor has no claws.
But you really DON'T have any clothes.
We're not gonna taste your food anymore.
What do you mean "we're fired"!?
He didn't act like this at the shelter.
Well Joe, it seems our cat is having a fifth-life crisis.
I know cats. Cats are friends of mine. You're no cat.
Cat heir.
He's going through his mid-lives crisis.
I hate to say it, but I'm beginning to understand why he'd gotten dropped off at the shelter.
Where did you find him -- the White House?
We're thinking about getting a dog
I'm terrified what your mother gave me is NOT a house cat.
I guess we should have had kids after all.
A French Poodle and German Shepherd are here to see you about Brexit.
I can't behead him; he's my husband...
This is not what I meant when I said you could have free reign of the house.
We tempted fate by naming our eighth cat Henry
What do you mean by, 'Make the Litterbox great Again.'
And I just want to add what a privilege it is to empty your litter box.
We're making you an outdoor cat
Do you think we should name him Donald?
I realize now I'm more of a dog person.
I don't think that just because you're fat, orange, and compelled to destroy other people's things we should make you king
She knows it's just for a day, right?
I really didn't mind until she had the dog beheaded.
We said 'your leash', not 'your liege'.........
"You're king now, but wait until Brutus comes home from dog camp!".
YOU put him back in the alley.
Really? Build a dog wall??
Do you think we are spoiling the cat?
Seriously,..."Caviar" is not cat food!
Great. An English Tabby with a Napoleon Complex.
We have to build a cat flap. He says Mexico will pay for it.
The Queen of Spayeds.
Chester, you were a kitten in that YouTube video. You have to move on.
Really, those "Impeach the Orange Hairball!" signs weren't for you.
Of course you're going to feel bloated if you keep eating everyone who disagrees with you.
Karma demands her reincarnation as a servile cat-owner.
No, your paws are not too small to be king.
Do you think he knows this is his 9th life?
OK. But just for a day!
The vet said Nine Lives, not Nine Wives.
We need to talk to you about your twitter account.
Yes, we are divorcing. And it IS your fault!
The first step is recognizing that there is a problem.
You've been to London to see the queen again, haven't you?
Well first of all, we're really not cat people.
Doug, I told you it was a bad idea to let him watch Game of Thrones.
Can I peel you a mouse?
The hour of the vacuum draws ever closer Sire, I advise full retreat.
Let's get a dog.
Of course I'm sure that the real kings of the jungle also use a litterbox.
It's pretty clear we've screwed up this cat royally...
The other pets have asked for this intervention.
We're sorry. We weren't thinking about your successor when we had you neutered.
I don't know where he gets it from, but the vet says Fancy Feast is a gateway food.
You've got to get this catnip thing under control.
Sure, impeachment may revoke the remainder of your nine lives.
You may be not a real king, but you're still a royal pain.
Told you not to name him Cat King Cole.
The vet said we can have him dethroned by next Wednesday.
Nothing we do for him is good enough
You're not a king, Donald! You're an overweight pussy who associates with vermin.
We've decided that we shouldn't leave "Game of Thrones" on for you when we go out.
..not wives ...lives.... nine lives
We feed him gourmet cat food one time...
I guess catching the mouse is out of the question.
You can't fire us. We're the people.
He binge watched Game of Thrones.
Well, it's an improvement over his Egyptian phase.
Okay, let me get this straight. Dogs have Masters...Cats have Staff!
He thinks he won the popular vote.
We should never have sent in for his DNA results ...
That's not the pussy I wanted you to treat like royalty.
Queen Elizabeth generally keeps her legs together and her privates covered.
What we said was: "We wish you were more LOYAL."
Perhaps we should consider treating him more like a pet.
Look, I think the dog has been in the dungeon long enough.
He still seems somehow...disenchanted, like...it's not enough.
And he was so humble when we picked him up at the shelter.
We should never had taught him to play chess.
We can best serve you if you tell us why you're disappointed in us.
Perhaps he is about to cough up an edict.
Fancy Feast is a cat food, not a lifestyle.
John has asked me to marry him.
Before you have him executed I think you should know - he is the one who cleans your litter box.
You - scratch my belly. And you - tell me I'm a good kitty
We're not asking you to abdicate, just to use the litter box.
Why do you say I spoil him?
Your father and I have something to tell you. You're just a friggin' cat.
No, really--we're happy to sleep in the living room. Anything else?
This all started with the Fancy Feast.
No you won't have any heirs. We are just calling a spayed a spade.
Consider this an intervention.
The dog isn't going to like this.
What have we done?
Only six months and he's already drunk with power.
He's been this way ever since his video hit one million views.
Maybe we were being too cute when we named him Louie Catorze.
We never should have let him get that Ancestry.com account!
It's not that you have no clothes, it's more that you really don't even need them.
And you thought I was self absorbed.
Yesterday he made me put on a hat with bells and tell him jokes.
Honestly, I prefer when it's reigning dogs.
He liked the Lion King better than Cats.
You miscounted, Henry. The last life was your eighth.
Maybe it's time we had a kid.
Sometimes when my meds thin out, I see glimpses of how absurd we've become.
Then we agree. Whoever gets the kids must also take the cat.
Please stop leaving dead peasants on the stoop.
Remember that time we talked about three co-equal branches of government?
This place is a dump! #Sad
...and that's why there can't be an heir to your throne.
Heavy lies the cat who wears the crown.
I know some people call it the 'throne', but you still need to use your litter box.
But you still have to go in the box.
We have it from a credible source there has been an assassination attempt on one of your nine lives.
Do you want the man to leave?
As your friends, we feel we need to talk to you about your use of catnip."
It's not relaxed, Dad. It's dead.
This has got to stop. "Treat your pet like royalty" is just a slogan on your food can.
Will our lordship be dining on Salmon Dinner or Poultry Platter this evening?
We should have told you earlier, but the real reason you can't produce an heir is because we had you fixed as a kitten.
My guess: New Jersey's governor at the beach?
Are you sure this was a condition of Aunt Gertrude's will?
He's still living off of his kitten YouTube fame.
All I wanted to do was make the backyard great again.
He says you can stay...apparently, you amuse him.
It really hurts our feelings when you tell all your friends that you were adopted by dog people.
King or not, we're still going to need you to poop in that box.
He's depressed. The mice won't pledge their allegiance, and he can't Twitter about it.
You're right, it doesn't work without the boots.
I'm afraid it's true, you're adopted.
Ok, the throne can stay but the guillotine goes.
We don't understand the electoral college either.
They do say to "dress for the job you want."
He's been like this ever since he got his ancestry.com report.
Get off the throne and use the litter box.
You were adopted.
L'etat, c'est meow
I didn’t dress him up. I thought you dressed him up.
Is it the ermine trim that troubles you?
We know you have a big following on youtube but you still have to use the litter box.
You voted for him...
Maybe he shouldn't have eaten all four-and-twenty blackbirds.
Peel me a mouse.
I think it started when that video of him walking on the piano went viral.
What did you do with the dog?
Listen, we don't care who you were in a past life.
We know Henry, you thought you would be a Tudor king, not a neutered king, but you are still royalty to us, even without your crown "jewels."
....a funny story about your inability to produce an heir....
Now that you've conquered the internet, let's talk about conquering your litter box.
You think the Colorado Catnip was just a bit too much?
It's a case of Lion King Syndrome.
He's got some entitlement issues...
You should have told us sooner that you wished to sire an heir.
What do you mean, spoiled him?
What possessed you to babysit Trump's cat?
While funny at first, we have now realized that calling you 'The Donald' was a bad idea.
Since we're all family, I think I'm allowed to tell you the decree you left in the spare bedroom really stinks.
Maybe it's always seemed like it, but we are not your minions.
There's always going to be someone with more YouTube views.
No one enjoys life #6 very much.
And this is only the first of his nine lives.
We’ve decided to become dog people.
And WHAT would you do with a horse?
Ok. one more time.. Where's the Dog ?
Define 'spoiled.'
I think we should explain why you won't be having an heir.
I told you, binge watching Game of Thrones was a bad idea!
We understand that you rule the land, but you still need to use the litterbox.
You're the one who named him Rex.
I told you not to name him Donald.
Maybe it's time to tell him he's a cat.
I miss the dog
We know. But that was the jungle. This is Poughkeepsie.
I used his scepter to scoop the litter box.
There's no easy way to say it Princess, but we're not your birth parents.
Well, at least he can't tweet.
Don't let that Best In Show award get to your head...
I still have claw marks from our last coup attempt
It's a place in the country where you'll have lots of other cats to reign over.
Would it be OK if we got a pet?
I thought he was your cat.
Just don't sit like that on the subway.
Probably shouldn't have named him Ceasar.
Dear, our cat is becoming a royal pain.
I liked it better when he was just a fat cat.
He stars in one viral video...
Do you think he hates it when we anthropomorphize him?
I told you not to go to the animal rescue shelter on Park Avenue
I don't care. He still gets canned food.
Maybe the four and twenty blackbirds baked in the pie was a bit too much.
Do we even have a milk chalice?
The dry cat food was an experiment...a mistake really.
We felt it's time for an intervention.
All he ever really wanted was to win the popular vote.
Well I voted for the dog.
We told you to word your three wishes carefully, Sir.
He just read his DNA report from Ancestry .com.
I wish we had just cremated him.
On the count of three, you distract him and I'll grab the remote.
What do you mean, we should name her after my mother?
Puss, it's only a pair of boots. We can buy you some new ones.
We just think...maybe it's time to consider community college.
It's no more 'Game of Thrones' for you.
Okay, now he's Henry the Eighth. Are you going to tell him about the 9 lives thing?
Your father and I think you're being a bit of a drama queen.
I know he's insufferable but at least we don't have mice.
Yes, Felix, here you are King, but in the jungle you are just somebody's lunch.
'Clearly, she's spent too much time around your mother."
Pretend you rule the house all you want, but you can be impeached.
Even though we'll no longer be married the prince & princess will still serve you.
I know this was in your mother's will but . . .
We know this is tough to hear, but your kitty litter does stink.
Don't shhhhhh me! If he tries to grab THIS pussy I'll scratch his eyes out with fire and fury the world has never seen.
Maybe he should go back to regular cat food.
Clearly the Fancy Feast has gone to her head.
Should we tell him he has no clothes?
He says he's Pussyrus of the House Pussyrian, The Litter-Born, First of His Name, The Father of Hairballs, Chaser of Mice, The Scratcher of Posts.
He's a spoiled, selfish little creature who needs constant attention and thinks he's the center of the universe. Let's call him Trumpy.
Honey, he's marked his territory, and we just have to get used to it.
It's great our marriage has found a shared focus.
I think it would be more respectful to just bury him.
O.K. We've exiled the dog. Now what?
With all due respect your majesty, we will not behead the dog.
It could be worse: He could get a Twitter account.
How do we tell him he didn't win the popular vote?
There was a mix-up at the DNA lab. It turns out you're just a housecat.
Hopefully this is the ninth life and not the first.
You're bored? Use another one of your lives.
This belly isn't going to rub itself, you know.
we're pregnant....
Since the dog died he's become impossible.
I think he ate your medical marijuana.
Cattitude
We've decided to form our own nation, led by the people.
Now that WE'VE gotten rid of the dog, shouldn't YOU be getting rid of the mice?
Think, where did you leave the boots?
I was sure he had 2 more left.
It must be a heir ball
My cat? I thought he was your cat!
Having a distant relative who's king of the jungle, doesn't really benefit you here.
I said we should get a dog, but noooooo!
1. You are not a lion. 2. This is not a jungle.
I'm glad to see our shelter cat is adjusting well.
Sorry, the vet thought it was necessary to do that. But you'll always be king in this house.
"You ate a tweet or you sent a tweet?''
You're turning us into dog people.
I know we're a disappointment...
But we like the dog.
I wonder why she was up for adoption?
Yes, we are cat people but don't press your luck.
Where did you last see your boots?
That's fake mews.
Do you think we may have spoiled her?
Must you do this every time Game of Thrones is on?
He thinks he rescued us.
Maybe we shouldn't have let him watch The Lion King.
Should we tell him he's neutered?
We've looked everywhere your excellency, but there's no sign of your covfefe.
Maybe His Highness should be eating Fiskies Lite?
You were right, the Emperor has no clothes.
We thought it was cute at first Sire. Now we'd like you to abdicate.
He's been down ever since they've been saying he has small paws.
We appreciate your eating all the mice in the kingdom, but you really should have paced yourself.
At the pound, they did say he was aloof.
I'm sorry, but you can't behead the vet.
You've been neutered. There are no heirs to your throne.
I told you if you kept buying that fancy food it would go to his head.
@RealGrumpyCat just unfollowed him.
Now Percy, just relax. The vet said the laxative works in about 30 minutes.
On second thought, let's not have kids.
Look, we regret letting you out of the bag...
Cuddles--Daddy and I feel we need to cut back on your 'Games of Thrones' viewing.
Dad, what do you think Chairman Meow thinks about?
May I introduce Whiskers of House Calico, the untrained, scratcher of posts, cousin of Mittens, and the cougher of hairballs.
We should have never agreed to have his DNA tested.
On the upside, though, he hasn't figured out how to use twitter.
Our therapist said we've spoiled you, so we stopped going. Want some tuna?
He doesn't chase mice anymore. He demands they be deported."
I'd have just had him cremated.
Would you go along with having us drop the dog off at a shelter instead of shooting him?
L'etat, c'est meow
No, no dogs. It's just reigning cats.
Sitting on the throne is not the same as using the litter box.
I see that "royal pain in the ass" was not metaphor.
Le chat, c'est moi.
So about this whole 'King of Beasts' thing....you're just a house cat.
Someone's feast is getting a little too fancy around here.
That new Fancy Feast really went to his head.
I think it is time to start making a succession plan.
First step, admit that catnip makes you powerless.
Perhaps we shouldn't have named him Donald.
Don't you think you're carrying your pedigree too far?
You'll be fine—guys like you always land on their feet.
Even my therapist thinks it's best I don't have children .
You'll always be 'Puss"to us, even without your boots.
We're having a baby.
We gotta stop buying fancy feast
Now is the season of our distemper.
Nice try, we're still not getting you Fancy Feast.
No, YOU tell him he's not wearing any clothes.
He wants to be called Donald
Actually, it's worse than this. He has the dog dressed up as the court jester.
I told you that naming the cat Donald was not a good idea
I think the Instagram success has gone to his head.
It was a rescue site. I thought it said disposed, not deposed.
Daddy just doesn't want to be court jester any more.
But, you still poop in a box.
Look, you can't have both--it's either unlimited power or more salmon.
Heavy is the cat who wears a crown.
The baby won't mean we'll love you any less.
We've kept it from you for years...you're a rescue.
We're willing to work with you but exiling Spot is a bit extreme.
He's on his ninth life, and he still hasn't won the caption contest.
'We had no idea the salmon was farm-raised."
Okay, I admit it, we should have frozen your eggs.
Looks like he's grabbed his last pussy.
Time to give Puss the boot.
I told you that youtube money would go straight to his head.
He learned to cat-spread from your man-spread.
Maybe we should have had kids instead.
I know he can seem a little arrogant...
He doesn't look happy. We need to do more.
Boy, killing that mouse really went to his head.
He really does have better health care coverage than we do.
Maybe we should check that pet training book again
He was a lot more fun when he was a kitten.
There's nobody left to fire.
He says if a pussy grabber can be president, why can a real pussy be king?
Fluffy, it’s nothing to be ashamed of… it was the biggest mouse we’ve ever seen too.
I think he's finally gotten too big for his britches.
No one ever said doing nothing all day would be easy.
The adulation from youtube has changed him.
If the texting doesn't stop, we're taking away the mouse.
Are we doing enough?
Looks like he's been bingeing on "Game of Thrones" again.
Balls," said the queen. "If I had them, I'd be King.
she has read Mom's will
They were removed when you were just a kitten. We had no idea you were royalty
We found a bag of catnip in your room.
You are the absolutely best cat ever. No cat in the universe catches more mice than you. Your videos go viral faster than any in the whole history of catdom!
We need to change the litter under your throne.
I refuse to address him as "Chairman Meow".
I thought a rescue cat would act a little less entitled.
I'm sure the other cats will like you. Maybe you could just take off the crown?
He realized he had no clothes.
Maybe we should have had a kid so it would go away to college.
Honey, wearing the crown isn't enough, you have to act like a king.
We're awfully sorry to bother you, King Whiskers, but another mouse sighting has been reported in the dungeon.
Time for a regime change.
He seems different since the dog died.
Well, aren't you the cats meow!
It's all about MEow!
First of all, I do not have owners. I have staff.
He's way less demanding than my last cat.
Not so sure we should have told the taxidermist "do what you think is best".
We want you to know that we've stopped your Twitter account for your own good.
We promise -- nothing will change when the baby comes.
It started with him saying, 'Après meow, le déluge'.
We need to talk to you about your catnip use.
I’m worried; since January he just sits around in his robe watching cable news.
You placed the dog in exile?
It's not your fault, it's ours.
The taxidermist really captured his ego.
Our kingdom has a litter problem.
We should have never changed his kibble.
My sire, word has arrived that the dog is gathered his troops.
For the ninth time, . . .
But I loved that canary.
Even though we're getting divorced, mommy and daddy don't love you any less.
He's not worried about succession, he's got nine lives.
Six wives and nine lives isn't so bad, Henry.
We declawed him but we can't seem to dethrone him.
I have to draw the line at tasting the royal cat food.
Your lineage ends here, you know that don't you?
Well you did ask me to have him stuffed "as he'd like to be remembered..."
He insists on eating only free range mice
Four and twenty blackbirds and you wonder why the stomach cramps?
I'm telling you, Jim... he's saying "MeNow."
Dinner is trapped, your highness.
What saddens thee? Why, even the mice who bear your cruelties' brunt adore you...
With only one more life to go after this one, Henry is coping as best as he can.
Our first mistake was naming him Donald.
He says he uses our closet because the litter box is such a dump.
I told you we shouldn't name him King.
He's surprisingly down-to-earth for a cat.
I think she said, 'Peel me a mouse.'
I fear at this point a spray bottle might be considered an act of treason.
We found some royal subjects on our bedroom carpet.
He forgot the first rule of being King: don't eat all your subjects.
We should never have let him see The Lion King.
'King of the Felines' has a nice ring to it, but we're sticking with 'Whiskers'.
Felix we know it hurts to lose your jewels but as far as we are concerned your crown is still intact.
We're staging a coup.
Yes, you're right. Some pets are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon 'em.
I refuse to call it a Royal Flush. Just dump the litter box.
Maybe we shouldn't have named her "Queenie."
So how is this different than normal?
When we said that your line of succession had been fixed, you may have misunderstood.
I think we've just found the parakeet
OK, just give him the scepter, but NOT the remote!
'Fat Cat' is actually a compliment, my liege.
Since your Lion King theme flopped, let's try Puss in Boots
He's just learned the coronation was fake mews.
He called for his pipe, and he called for his bowl, but I couldn't find his fiddlers three anywhere.
Maybe we have spoiled him.
I knew we shouldn't have switched him to Fancy Feast.
Heavy is the cat that wears the crown...
So I see he caught the laser dot.
Is it possible we've overindulged him?
Cheer up! Don't let the fact that no one came to your "Hair Ball" ruin a perfectly wonderful coronation.
Game of Thrones withdrawal
And thanks to Bob Barker, there's no line of succession.
We're going to be terrible parents.
Heavy lies the cat who wears the crown.
I don't know how to break this to you. We're pregnant.
This is why I wanted a dog.
Ancestry.com said his great grandfather was King of The Jungle.
He had the dog beheaded.
That's fake mews.
I told you we shouldn't have named him "Trump."
We just don't feel 'off with his head' is a proportionate response to Buddy eating out of your dish.
I told you not to let him binge-watch.
Please let us have a baby!
Pampering him?... I don't think we're pampering him.
We are having this intervention, because you are really not the King of this household
I'm not sure, but I think he said "A mouse...my kingdom for a mouse!"
Yes, Felix, all lions are felines, but not all felines are lions. Sorry!
He prefers Lord Fluffykins now.
The Aristocats is just a movie.
That's the last time we get Fancy Feast.
So, you went to London to visit the Queen. Then what?
Herding cats is exhausting.
Before you decide to give this all up, ask yourself what you would do with a horse if you had one.
The townsfolk have been overthrown but what about our mouse problem?
"This isn't what I meant when I said I wanted you to worship my pussy." (sorry for the crude language, but ya gotta admit - solid caption.)
It's ennui. Melancholy and Weltschmerz are beneath him.
He's depressed about the line of succession.
Uneasy lies the cat that wears a crown
His first eight lives he was a peasant.
It was one way to keep him off the sofa...
Wait 'til he finds out that he'll never have an heir.
Look Henry, Fred is moving in tomorrow but I told him he only gets to be prince.
Tell me again why we didn't get a dog?
Joe wants you to know he's sorry about dinner tonight and wonders if you will be keeping him on staff.
It's important to recognize that there are three co-equal branches of governing this household.
At least he's not Trump.
Would you care for tuna tartare or mousse de canard?
We'll start with an amuse bouche of pureed oysters, followed by scallop tartare, and then a mouse and vole terrine, and finishing with a catnip sorbet.
So, having 9 lives has turned out to be exhausting and a bit humbling?
We aren't saying we would have a baby—just that, if we did, we wouldn't love it.
Maybe we should have voted for the dog
It started with the Fancy Feast.
I told you not to name him Henry!
We just can't afford Fancy Feast anymore.
The vet suggested he’s willing to pardon us.
We need to switch to dry food, honey. The Fancy Feast is going to his head.
We didn't think an heir would be so important when we had you neutered.
I'd have you both killed in an instant if I cared enough to utter your names.
You really shouldn't have called them "a litterbox of deplorables".
Jim, this cat is a royal pain in the butt!
Would you consider Ms Fluffy down the street for queen
What did she mean, 'thank god they didn't have kids?'
We never did want to tell you that you really are just a cat.
I know the Cowardly Lion....The Cowardly Lion is a friend of mine....You are no Cowardly Lion.....enough, get back in the kitchen.
Get this through your furry head. We will NOT call you 'Your Highness'!
'Fit for a king' is a marketing gimmick - you just ate too much.
You tell him we're getting a puppy.
Cat King Cole
The emperor needs new claws.
Our president freaked her out.
He just realized he rules in a constitutional monarchy, and his powers are purely ceremonial.
Maybe we should cut back on the Fancy Feast.
We should never have let him go on Ancestry.com!
The Fancy Feast has really gone to his head.
He has a sixth sense of entitlement.
Do you think it's time we had kids?
He thinks he's the cat's meow.
He wants a personal groomer, a sleep chamber, and a purring coach.
HENRY THE NEUTERED CONTEMPLATES LIFE WITHOUT HIS ORBS AND SCEPTER
But if we got a dog, you would still be king.
Cats rule. Dogs drool. We get that.
So we are all in agreement. Pussy rules.
Heavy is the head that wears the crown. So, too, is the belly that holds the mouse.
Turns out it's just reigning cats, no dogs.
He is very merciful....as long as you go get him the tuna casserole.
The results are back. This is not the jungle and you are not the king.
Sweetheart, there was not one million mice watching. I'm sorry, it's just not true.
This Caturday business is getting out of control
He liked your idea of appointing a “Presidential Pussy” but apparently he has someone else in mind.
The feast was too fancy.
I guess we shouldn't have used Craig's List to find a taxidermist.
That's not the way you make "Kitty litter great again".
I hope our pampering makes up for the neutering.
I just thought it would partially make up for the vet taking away his, um, crown jewels.
We need to talk about your cattitude.
You can keep the throne; crown and robe go back to Mar-a-Lago - and tell him you're sorry.
Heavy is the Tabby that wears the crown.
Maybe it's time we told him he's a rescue, not a regent
I know what Ancestry.com said but you still have to use the litter box.
It's OK. Not every emperor has clothes.
Of course the barking next door is annoying, we agree - but is military action really an option?
So, what are you king of exactly?
Maybe enough with the "Fancy Feast?"
Where did you think I would get the fur trim?
This is number 9. He's finally dead. I'm in charge again, no more cats.
It's your fault. You created his Instagram page.
Le roi, c'est miaou.
Order something from Amazon and give me the box.
If only he'd stop giving the mice pardons.
The kids would really like their sandbox back.
Frankly we said neutered not knighted
The King of Beasts still needs a litter box.
But sire, the dog said he doesn't WANT to be neutered.
You tell him that it's only a titular office.
We think its time to stop feeding you from the table.
Maybe it was the four and twenty blackbirds.
We meant cat hair...not cat heir.
You were adopted.
Maybe just a tad overdressed for the vet.
We should have seen this coming when he promised the other cats he'd build a wall to keep the dogs out.
Hey, Queen of Spayeds, your dinner's ready.
Life under Purrsian rule
Why didn't we quash this back when he was just an obnoxious kitten?
What? Chicken? Tuna? Fish pate'? What?
At least when he's sleeping he's not tweeting.
The whole "King of the Forest" thing kind of ended with canned food.
We are all disappointed that William and Kate chose a hampster.
Maybe naming him "The Donald" wasn't such a good idea after all.
I prefer his Macbeth.
You're not a Windsor. You're not a Tudor. You're just a cat. Get over it!
We've asked you here tonight because we love you, and we want to tell you from us: we're adopting a dog.
Mr. Whiskers? We're just wondering if you've seen Miss Feathers?
We will remain your faithful subjects, King Kitty, but in different houses, so now you will have two kingdoms!
I told you it was a mistake to name him Donald.
So, this is the cat's pajamas?
Well, his YouTube channel does make more than us.
He had his second wife declawed.
Sorry, we won't cut the dog's head off.
Remember how we agreed not to leave him with your mother?
Dad and I have decided it's time you started paying rent.
A mouse, a mouse, my kingdom for a mouse!
Would it help if we peeled you a mouse?
He pronounced himself ruler of mice and men.
When you said you'd adopted a Cavalier King Charles, this wasn't what I'd imagined.
But if you banish us, who will feed you?
Agreed, naming the cat Trump might not have been the best idea.
He’s getting sleepy. Hurry up and ask your favor.
I think eating all this "Fancy Feast" has gone to his head...
'Puss and Boots 2' just went straight to video
Another hard day rounding up undocumented dogs.
Snuggles, I don't care that your DNA test shows you are a Royal Siamese. We're sending it all back and I'm cancelling your Mastercard.
Let them eat mice.
It was only a month ago, he was completely feral.
I told you switching to Fancy Feast would go to his head.
Catnip always gives him delusions of grandeur.
Seems he didn't fancy the lobster... back to Beluga.
"Nothing excites him anymore".
It's time to tell you why there will be no heirs.
Not abdication, just stop spraying the drapes.
He now taxes the mice instead of eating them.
What do you mean, 'let them eat tuna!'.??
When it comes to your majesty's personal hygiene, the royal we does not include us.
So, you do understand that Fido won the popular vote?
You're 18 now, you need to move out.
We're both really sorry. The vet assured us that it would improve your personality.
It wouldn't be for about nine months, but we wanted to ask you first.
He's been binge-watching Downton Tabby.
It's that only child thing
He said he's too pooped to conquer.
The neighbor's dog showed him he doesn't really rule the animal kingdom.
Your father and I need to tell you something. . . you're adopted
I told you not to name him Hamlet.
I've come to see you as more of an outdoor couple.
Maybe we need a hobby?
It's your turn to dip the dead mice in chocolate.
We have only ourselves to blame.
Remember, if Trump can be elected - you can be anything you want to be.
As far as we're concerned, your video did go viral.
He catches one little mouse and thinks he's king
No, the crown does not make you look fat.
Don't blame me, I didn't vote for the cat.
He grabbed the wrong pussy.
...and when you're a star, they let you do anything.
Maybe we shouldn't have let him watch The Lion King.
I told you naming him Donald would set the wrong expectations.
He's been binge watching Game of Thrones on the Cat Channel...
We have some bad news, Tabby - it's actually just the lion that's the king of the jungle.
We never should've told him that he's related to lions.
I fear he's developed a bad case of Trump Complex.
Do you think, maybe, we might have become those sort of people?
We don't like who you become after you've had Fancy Feast.
We're sorry. It never occurred to us that having a legitimate heir to the throne would mean so much to you.
Lord, the vet says you have fleas.
We are Cat people. We're just not King Cat people.
But wise one, if we slice the dog in half, will he not die?
This isn't what I meant when I said I wanted you to treat my pussy as royalty.
Your turn in the jester outfit.
We would like to take a couple of days vacation. What do you think?
I'm beginning to doubt that this is what the Pet Therapist had in mind.
I don't know how the Joneses do it with three!
We've decided to get a dog, and we're going to name him Rex. You might want to reconsider your attitude.
I don't know what else you want from us
Do you think we might have spoiled him?
It all started when he figured out how to tweet lies about the dog ...
After he tweets he watches television all day.
I'm sorry sweetie, but I don't think "Let them eat Friskies" is an appropriate response.
I'm getting concerned. He wants to abdicate.
OK, so maybe it's not the best of your nine, but surely we're in the top three
I told you not to name her Princess!
I'm leaving you for a man with a dog.
Let's just be glad he's not into Breaking Bad.
In terms of lives, you're now Henry the 9th.
That Trump Brand (c) cat food really works!
Should we tell him he's no longer sitting pretty?
Donald, We are sorry but Fox & friends is not on today
We need to talk..
There is unrest throughout the alley because you have sired too many heirs.
It's not working. He's still ignoring us.
You get nine lives, darling, not wives
I agree that the crowd at the Coronation was the largest ever! Just huge and you never looked better!
Sure, he can govern. But how is he at catching mice?
One too many canaries.
One way or another, we will bring you the head of The Red Dot.
I think the cat sitter spoils him.
Ok fine, no more binge watching Game of Thrones.
Do you want your kill au poivre or with bernaise sauce?
It's OK that you have no clothes.
Do you think we let him watch The Lion King too often?
But you tried to catch the mouse, and that's what counts.
The veterinarian said it's the Trump effect.
I'm sorry, but it's a constitutional monarchy.
Don't tell us there wasn't a palace party - there was catnip everywhere and a palm tree in the cat box.
Since she got hooked on PBS, she identifies as Victoria, not Pussin-Boots.
The bad news is you're being neutered.
We have reason to believe Rufus' death may not have been an accident.
He's just discovered Game of Thrones.
We think you should stop binge-watching Game of Thrones.
He's been like this ever since the dog died.
Don't worry. We can get more mice.
It's time you knew, Wigglesworth. You were adopted.
We can't behead the dog.
Where did you get the catnip ?
But we agreed you'd return it after Halloween.
So. You got your tongue?
What kind of boots?
It's your turn to give him his foot massage.
But we promise to be home by dinner.
We'll keep Rex outside but we're not putting him in chains.
We may be the hoi polloi, but you do remember that you need us for food & water & stuff, right?
We honestly had no idea eight lives would fly by that fast.
That's the third vet he's fired this week.
So Rex, your analyst and I have been chatting...
Thank goodness we never had children.
We should never have let him watch Puss & Boots
You have to stop binge watching ' Game of Thrones'.
Just a year ago he was feral & eating out of garbage cans!
We would like to discuss tonight's menu.
We're thinking about getting a dog
Look, we bought you the crown but we didn't think you'd turn into an asshole.
We would have made great parents.
We're hoping you might consider cutting down just a bit on your catnip consumption.
We shouldn't have named him Trump
We think you should imagine this conversation more as implied introspection, and not as an intrusive intervention.
Just because we want children doesn’t mean we don’t love you.
You should see his litter box.
Seeing how he does rule the house, I thought, I'd make it official.
Do you think he's seriously considering abdicating?
Isn't this healthier than watching the current administration flatter the president?
Eight down, one to go.
I could call the shelter, but I don't think they'll take him back.
What ticks me off is how he just expects lifestyle improvements.
You can't become Queen dear. You've been fixed.
Now that Timmy's in college, you'll be taking his place in the family.
I can never tell when he wants attention.
It's your turn to rub his belly.
tragically, all too soon, Gingerbread is feeling the futility of power
He's descended from Louis the Furteenth.
Now can we pet you?
His kingdom for a mouse.
...pate en croute...coq au vin...ratatouille...blanquette de veau...bouillabaisse...or?
You say it worked for the frog?
Ok. So will you now please tell us where you put the remote?
See why I hate cats.
I need my boots!
YOU had to go and tell him this was a democracy!
Yes, Majesty, the cat next door will pay for the wall.
You'd really abdicate all this for an alley cat?
We played along, but having the dog beheaded went too far.
I'm afraid letting her watch Game of Thrones with us for the last 6 years has gone to her head.
He's gone through our entire supply of mouse jesters.
I liked him when he was just plain Henry.
No -- he's not "just a cat."
I know you're bored, but we just can't afford a court jester.
You have no heirs, Your Majesty, because...
Please accept the fact that being fixed means you have no heir to the throne.
Relax. The dogs of war have been boarded.
He just got his results back from Ancestry.com, and it turns out he's Egyptian royalty.
We tried to tell you being king would be complicated.
He fired his communications director...
Peel me a mouse.
We should have had children.
Puissant, isn't he?
The dog wants his stuff back.
You're right. We'd suck at raising kids.
We know this will come as a disappointment, but 'Princess' is just a name.
Can't you just try canned tuna?
We want to talk about your sense of white cat privilege
What do you mean you're not getting more humans when we're gone?
So, can we assume you prefer being an indoor cat?
You're just not merry enough to play Old King Cole.
He wears indolence well don't you think?
What if we held a fur ball?
Do you think we're in his will?
Apparently he is not familiar with the concept of noblesse oblige.
It was probably that thing about promising you'd catch more mice than the world had ever seen...thousands...millions...
The dog is gone, my lord.
Would you be too upset if we went away for the weekend?
At least he's not tweeting about us.
So then I thought, why not just make it official?
You'll have to abdicate if I let you out.
We are not amused
There will be no heirs, you were neutered.
What if we do something to make him feel special?
Fluffy, I'd like to introduce you to my new boyfriend Jake. I hope you two will get along.
I told you that calling her "Princess" would go too far.
He changed after we did his ancestry testing.
So no, neutral is a totally different thing.
He says he's into Game Of Thrones but I caught him watching Fox News
With all due respect, we'd like to discuss some type of power sharing arrangement.
Mom keeps saying we spoil him too much.
I said, 'Well, you're not actually king of the beasts.' He's taking it poorly.
I didn't know you were a cat person.
Honey, don't be sad, Fat cat is just a term used for the rich and important.
Where did President Trump grab you?
We're The Butlers. Not yours.
The taxidermist called it the "royale package."
Its time we tell the cat it was born in an alley
Were we wrong to name him Donald?
You're a cat, dear, not a corgi.
It's not as bad as you think - he is actually a very benevolent ruler.
You need to stop with the videos and go out and play.
I still don't understand why they call me a crazy cat lady.
Caesar, we wanted to let you know we have adopted two new kittens, Brutus and Cassius.
Chicken or Fish? Take your time.
Little does he know, he's the last of his line.
We really think you'd be more fulfilled if you went outside and mingled with the commoners.
I know it’s unsettling, but it’s true. We’re Democrats.
It's reigning cats, not dogs.
Elect a clown. Expect a circus!
That "grab 'em by the pussy" brag keeps coming back up like a hairball.
The Vet thinks that neutering might help.
Lion King is JUST a movie, Felix!
He's been like this ever since his video hit five million views
Well...how about line-caught salmon?
I Don't care who he thinks he is he still has to use the kitty litter box
I told you that Fancy Feast food would go to his head.
If only my pussy was treated this well
This one isn't as subtle as the last one.
We need to stop showing him documentaries on Ancient Egpyt.
I think we're spoiling him.
I know "heavy is the head that wears the crown"-your job is still to catch mice.
He has a very solid base among the alt-rat.
I told you we should have gotten a dog.
"Let them eat kibble." - Meowie Antoinette
Governing is a lot harder than he thought it's be.
Our mistake was treating her like a queen.
We should have thought about the line of succession before we had him neutered.
Since we let our cat rule us, does this mean we're liberals?
Maybe we shouldn't have named him Trumpie.
We're not going to sugarcoat it. We are not flying the Union Jack whenever you're in the house.
Honey, we really should make sure we don't confuse catnip for weed.
Too much catnip, your Highness?
We did tell the taxidermist to make him look regal.
Yes, we like you to think outside the box; just not the litter box.
I'm sorry, but we're pregnant. You're going have to learn to share power.
Your dominion is the litter box.
I don't spoil him that much.
I worry that we're spoiling her.
The Lion King was just a cartoon. It's not real life…
Losing the popular vote doesn't mean you're not popular.
It was your idea to name him Donald.
I liked his inferiority complex better.
Looks like you've grabbed your last pussy.
Actually, this just accentuates his everyday lack of clothing.
Is that what you call giving my pussy the royal treatment?
It all started when you gave him Fancy Feast.
Okay, belly rub, Jim will quarter the mice, then butt grooming, ignore us while you take nap number eight so that you'll be prepared to tear up the carpet at your usual 3:18AM; got it.
Maybe you've gone astray.
I don’t know- since he executed all of his enemies, drank their blood and then ate their children, he’s just lost his kitten playfulness.
Cheer up, Liberace, your glitter litter is here!
It's reigning cats.
Fluffy, you have to stop making the dog eat cake.
So we have your permission to marry?
Even though you're the King now, you can't just grab 'em by the pussy.
Could we have one child?
He has been watching Game of Thrones.
...so instead the vet put us on some new meds to make us more sympathetic to his point of view.
Cheer up. At least you won for "Miss Congeniality"l
The vet says it's PCD...post coronation depression.
Good thing, he lost the popular vote.
Your kingdom needs you to solve the mouse situation.
He didn't realize ruling the animal kingdom would be so hard.
Your highness, having 9 lives is more than most of us.
The jester will be back from the vet's tomorrow.
Yes, you were adopted, we should have told you sooner.
You didn't hear it from me, but the dog and fish are planning a coup.
I think it was a mistake naming him, 'The Donald'.
Seriously, Dad... if you do post the video, PLEASE don't mention my name.
What if Don got neutered too?
I agree, it's a bit much, but he did get rid of the mice.
This is so typical of your generation.
This is number nine, and it was on her bucket list.
Should we tell him we're getting a dog or let it be a surprise?
You're the one that got his DNA tested.
Dethroning really isn't humane.
Well, Donald, getting the job and doing the job require different talents.
I draw the line at beheading the dog.
The emperor has no claws.
I do believe the King has no clothes
I really thought it was what he wanted. Maybe we should get him a Superman cape.
Do you think maybe we should take a break from Game of Thrones?
Heavy the butt that wears the crown.
You must understand it's our house ... your Highness?
All you have to do is wave.
He gets like this every time I date.
Newsweek called. They want to put you on the cover.
He’s just a puppy, sure. But he’ll be dead long before your reign comes to an end. Ya know, because of the nine lives and everything?
Just because you have little paws doesn't make you a king.
I told you not to feed him. I told you not to make eye contact.
Sorry Bill, you must leave. The cat won.
His attitude is really starting to show.
What meddlesome mouse?
Honey, I thought we agreed on cremation.
The dog was one thing. But Dad's always been so nice to you.
We have noticed you've been hitting the catnip more as of late.
So, just how are we supposed to come in on Little Cat Feet?
Shouldn't the king be wearing his pants?
And you thought a cat would be low maintenance.
so, where did you lose your boots?
One of you needs to see a therapist.
I think he's developing an attitude.
You think we've been a tad too indulgent?
Canned it is.
Hail, Kitty Kitty ...
Not to worry. You have 8 more lives to establish your legacy
So now that you are truly king will you stop throwing up on the carpet?
Now he communicates only by tweets.
Maybe we should just give him some of my Xanax instead.
Worst case scenario: He reigns the whole four years.
I know... but he's a stray. And, I think he likes football.
We should have never taken him to see the Lion King
And you're absolutely sure you don't know anything about Mrs. Keldorf's canary?
He wants to watch the Lion King, again.
They say, 'Uneasy lays the head that wears a crown.' My ass.
I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sick of bringing him dead mice.
"Do you think it's time to have a kid?
We should have just had a child
He was more of an 'anything but a dog' choice.
Please, Princess. It's wild, sustainable fish, not farm raised.
Maybe a cat scan would get to the bottom of your royal displeasure.
I wonder about his other eight lives.
I know it's not much but it's all we could afford.
I warned him it would be lonely at the top, but he's become inconsolable.
If I had to guess, I'd say he ate the whole tub of Imperial margarine.
We know you've been following the news, but this household is still a democracy.
My final decree, all my catnip will be medicinal, not recreational.
First the crown; now the man-spreading...
The vet says it's Stage 4 Ennuie.
I'll call the vet.
Well, I suppose he's entitled enough to grab any pussy he wants.
Maybe we shouldn't have named him "Rex."
Honestly that term "fat cat" was not a slur aimed at you personally.
Richard, I thought we had a deal. We bring you a horse, you give us back the house.
Come on, it's just one mouse.
We think you may have the wrong impression.
Maybe we should take Her Highness to the Shelter to show her how the other cats live.
" There's no line of succession, he's getting fixed tomorrow".
Just try being a cat.
Your mother was a Tabby
I told you a cat would be a royal pain.
The pet store told me it was excellent catnip!
How did Donald Trump's cat get in here?
And Mr. Snugglepaws wept, for there were no more worlds to conquer.
Bring me the little red dot!
Maybe we've been a bit overindulgent.
I know there's a 'me' in 'meow', but this is getting ridiculous.
You won't believe his litter box.
What do you mean I am fat? My crown still fits.
I don't know how to tell you this but we're getting a dog.
I promise, we said 'Kitty Leader'.
The vet is pushing military school.
No one told me this herding Congressional cats would be so hard.
You just now realized it is all ceremonial?
The vet says that it's gout.
I knew he shouldn't have read, "The Art of the Deal"
His kingdom for a mouse.
Where is Mommy's smartphone?
maybe we should have had kids.
We need to talk about the royal litter box, Your Majesty.
You promised to make cats great again.
William and Kate said positively not. Harry's still a maybe.
Look, we get it -- your press secretary quit, you had to fire your communications director, you lost a big vote in Congress, and everyone think the dogs were behind your election -- but that's no reason to go from two scoops of kibble to three.
My mistake, your meowjesty.
Why does my cat allergy mean I'm the one who must be rehomed?
Maybe if you didn't bat them around with your paws they'd respect you more.
Listen, you can't rule our lives, but you can sleep in the bed tonight.
You have to wait until she extends her paw to take it.
Son, let me explain 9 lives to you
My psycharist says I'll stop seeing him after the medications start working.
Nobody said being top cat was going to be easy.
About your attitude...
But you're the king of the urban jungle.
I'm afraid she'll turn out like a Lannister
And for just ten bucks more, the taxidermist threw in the crown.
And just where did you exile the dog?
I think killing his own mice will be good for him.
Who are these three blind mice you speak of.
What complex?
How many lives before succession goes to us?
He's been like this ever since we switched the cat food to Fancy Feast
Your Majesty, we just got a dog, his name is George Washington.
I told you that assertiveness class at the Humane Society was a bad idea.
Uneasy lies the cat that wears a crown
Yes, you're King, but you weren't actually voted in.
He’s been acting like this ever since he crawled off the president’s head.
Roger and I would like to talk to you about the sudden spate of beheadings.
She thinks she was Cleopatra in her last life.
Curiosity killed the last king
I guess I'm just more of an egalitarian. You know, a dog person.
We're cat people, not the cat's people.
No, that's not how it works. The mice should not come to you.
I don't care if he is one of your loyal subjects, you can't eat the goldfish.
A thousand pardons your majesty, but its time for your flea and tick treatment.
But he's an out of control loser and you're hugely amazing!
He left explicit instructions on how he'd like to be stuffed
I gotta say, I have a pet peeve.
Are you sure it's just a phase?
We can't bring that mouse back to life, but we can buy you a new one.
Do you really prefer regal to aloof?
So now you want four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie?
But you're more than a figurehead to us, Pooky.
I think we made some mistakes.
It hasn't changed him.
King of the living room is just as impressive as King of the Jungle.
He looks exhausted, but he still has to preside over the upcoming Fur Ball.
Well, I did tell the taxidermist he ruled the house.
Catatonic?
Do you think we pamper him enough?
We've decided to get a dog.
OK, forget about the crown. Tell us who sold you the cape?
We should have never let her binge watch "The Crown."
We told you to be careful what you wish for, Donald!
How would you feel about our having a baby?
His phycologist suggested affirmation therapy after the toilet paper incident.
You do realize that the real king of the jungle is infested with lice, sleeps outside and has to do a lot of running and jumping in order to eat?
The taxidermist installed a 'purr' box. Go ahead, squeeze his paw.
I think we need to talk.
Come on, even the King of England had trouble with public speaking.
Do you think he would be happier if he knew how to Tweet?
His therapist said it will help his esteem issues.
I told him that four and twenty blackbird pie was too much!
Puss, the boots have walked on.
I know she's failed to produce a male heir your majesty, but do we really need to put her down?
Maybe we should just get a dog.
Such a fascinating case of feline depression. Totally non responsive to the feather on a string? Nothing with the laser pointer either? And who could this Timon and Pumbaa be he keeps referring to?
Daddy's going to have a puppy
We "took care of" the dog. What else?
'It just doesn't FEEL like I'm ruling the world'
Yeah, but tomorrow she'll be the Queen of Spayeds...
The mice seem to sense that you've lost your killer instinct.
Are you thinking about your feral days?
I think he's an indoor cat.
We have GOT to stop watching Game of Thrones
Uneasy is the cat who wears the crown
We know you'll end up loving the new kitten....
OK, no more binge watching Game of Thrones.
Maybe I shouldn't have breastfed him.
I know, I know, but otherwise he throws litter at you.
I don't think she's as into making cute cat videos as you are.
I ask for your mercy and hereby promise to never again leave the seat down.
How have we gone from a "cat in the cradle and a silver spoon" to this?
His coming out was no real surprise.
Ever since we had him neutered, he's been depressed about his line of succession.
Sire, it appears the kingdom is out of catnip.
Ever since he got his genealogy test results he's been acting like this.
Honey, if you're not having any fun, it's O.K. with Mommy if you want to go back to being a regular cat.
Wake up. Your litter awaits
Your mother and I think it's about time you pulled more weight around here.
A house cat wasn't good enough, you had to get a House of Windsor cat.
I feel like she's rubbing our nose in it now.
It happened when I introduced the new kitten to him
We know it won't make up for the neutering, but it's the best we can do.
I know, sweetie. It's sad to realize you can't be whatever you want to be if you just try hard enough.
He was hoping to become the first pet in the Trump White House.
Nobody's accusing anyone yet, we're just talking about hairballs in general.
"Think about it, Tigger -- is this really what you want to with your nine lives?
The vet's seen this before, but only in small-pawed orange cats. Fortunately it doesn't last long.
We're just saying it's hard to establish a dynasty when you're neutered
Don't worry. We hold the real power as long as we have the yarn ball and the laser pointer.
Sure, he can do a mean "King Lear," but he'll always be "Fifi" to me.
You were right, neutering him years ago would have been a better.
His scepter? No, have you looked under the sofa?
He made the litter box great again.
I just think he'd feel more supported if we gave him an elected position instead.
Do you think we're overcompensating?
Stupid DNA test.
His father was a real estate developer. He's ever scratched or clawed for anything.
The emperor is wearing no clothes.
Just how am I spoiling Rex?
You know, you're not the only pussy with leadership problems right now.
How long do you think it will take for them to realize he's dead?
Pride and Paunch
Dogs have masters, cats have staff.
Your majesty, it's just not royal of you to poop outside of your litter box.
First, the dog goes
Just like his father.
Of course he looks worried. Nine lives...Henry VIII. You do the math.
I knew letting him on the bed that first time was a mistake.
His majesty's first edict is to legalize catnip
It's a good thing we never had kids.
Begging your pardon Your Highness but, would this be a good time to discuss the mouse under the kitchen sink?
Four and twenty blackbirds were too many to eat all at once, King Tom.
We can't exile the dog. The kids like him.
We've should've never got him that PetSmart giftcard.
Looking back now, reading "Hey Diddle Diddle" to a cat named Nero may not have been fully thought-out.
We believe that the dog may be planning a coup.
Well, as for succession, there's still the small matter of that surgery...
We just want you to know how difficult financial planning is with your nine lives
What do you mean by, 'Just let them eat mice?'
Your Highness, the dog humbly requests a lower number on his shock collar.
We didn't realize at the time how important heirs were going to be.
I don't think the meal was fit for a king.
Don't complain! We warned you of the responsibilities.
I know you picked up a taxidermy hobby but you didn't have to kill my cat.
Well, it was your idea to name him Balthus.
The red dot eludes me. I am a failure. Bring me hemlock, my lady.
I think we should put him on Prozcat.
They were out of emperor penguins
He says we have to start using the litter box.
Shouting, "Off with their heads!" will not solve our mice problem.
No, Whiskers, you are not the king of France.
Maybe a non-orange cat wouldn't have these delusions of grandeur.
Maybe we should give him back his phone.
We're not literally knocking you off your throne. We're just going to exert a little more authority so you don't make all the rules around here.
We have a royal problem here.
Yes, very regal but is he house trained?
You should see his litter box.
I think he's drunk with power.
All we're asking is that you acknowledge that "cat privilege" is a thing.
I think he's been watching too much Game of Thrones
We named you "Simba" ironically. You're not even a lion.
Henry's on his Eighth life.
So I guess the 'king of the jungle' thing didn't work out?
I told you not to name her Princess!
Okay, maybe we have been spoiling him.
Honestly Geoffrey, you never approve of any of my friends.
The vet recommends Prozac for his depression but says there isn't a lot we can do about his grandiosity.
I told Princess Fluffy we were getting a puppy.
Governing is much harder than he thought it'd be.
We need to talk about where your majesty pees
He says this place is a dump, but he's not even trying to hit the litter box.
Your majesty, we are all out of milk...
Naming her Cersei might have been a mistake.
Un-neuter me, then maybe we'll talk.
It's supposed to boost his self-esteem.
Any second now. He will tell us what to do.
He must be sitting on the remote
How come every time you do catnip you become such a drama queen?
I don't care what they did in Egypt, I'm done being his servant.
The vet says megalomania isn't rare in cats.
Initially we imagined the royal litter box as a harmless incentive.
What, you think your kitty litter don't stink?
He's in over his whiskers...
His ancestry kit said he was part Siamese...
He's still mad that he lost the popular vote.
He made the hamster dress up as a court jester before eating him.
Her mewjesty has been this way since the DNA results came back feral.
'No, you can't fire us'
Should we bring him in for fleas and God complex?
No. I don't care if You Tube thinks you're hilarious. I'm not wearing this thing.
Would it have been better not to let him watch all those reruns of "The Apprentice."
Promise me you won't binge watch Game of Thrones with him ever again.
Your Majesty, consider your legacy. Kill the rat that ate the malt that lay in the house that Jack built!
Sorry, but you really can't fire the dog.
We didn't realize you were lactose-intolerant.
Our relationship was never the same after grandma left her money to Mittens.
There is no easy way to tell you this, so here goes: we're having a baby.
Won't somebody rid me of these meddlesome owners?
This is why we advised against catnip brownies at the coronation after-party.
No, I don't think we spoil her.
It's top-cat ennui.
The mice are calling for your head.
Are we done watching "King of Thrones?"
Listen, we accept that cats can be difficult, but we are absolutely not bowing...
I told you we shouldn't have let him watch "Game of Thrones".
I'm sorry but "the Iron Throne, kitty version" was sold out.
The Lion King really created a lot of expectations.
...oh, and he wants the parrot drawn and quartered.
"Do you notice something different about him since we switched to Trump kibble?
We've called this house meeting to discuss your inability to respect your fellow housemates.
No, even with the robe you'll shed, so you can't sit on the furniture.
Well, since you're a cat, chances of voter fraud are low.
We should get him some shorts.
But he's sorry. Really, really sorry.
And to think we found him in an alley!
We exist only to serve you, but the dog is disputing your claim to the throne.
This happens every time the dog goes to the groomers.
He's been beheading local rodents he feels are a threat.
We think it's time you had one of your staff clean the litter box.
It was your idea to take him to "The Lion King"!
They're calling it "entitlement malaise".
Sorry, but we're not putting turrets on the litter box.
I warned you at the shelter the orange male would be trouble.
I meant throne as a euphemism for litter box
Are you sure the DNA test was accurate? I find it hard to believe that our cat is related to Louis XIV of France.
The system is rigged to benefit the fat cats.
Let him have his birthday moment; he goes to the vet tomorrow.
We should never have named him Donald.
I didn't dress him like that. Did you?
Let's have no more talk of abdication. It's just a very small puppy.
We need to talk about our plans for your royal 'family jewels.'
Heavy meows the head that wears the crown!
Head of the House of Whisker
OK, your meow-jesty.
We've let this happen.
Now is the summer of his content.
We humbly ask your forgiveness for presenting dry food to you
Just tell us what to do.
I think he knows I'm pregnant.
I think he's finally realized that he can't produce an heir.
I'm worried. He hasn't issued a decree since we had him neutered.
We think it's time that you looked for a job...
It's done nothing for his posture.
He's lost interest in everything now that he's got us trained.
We can change your name, Kitty, but "Pussy King" is a "no."
I know you felt bad when you yelled at him earlier but this is a little much.
Do you think he's depressed?
Look, we know the catnip is yours.
You wouldn't believe what I had to do to the litterbox.
Maybe we shouldn't have named him Henry.
She married Prince William. They've got kids. It's time to move on.
We'll have to buy another canary before Molly gets home from school.
You still need to go to the vet just like everyone else.
He says he's a dog in a cat's body.
Oh no, the cat's been watching CNN again.
He still doesn't look happy.
It seems in ancient times cats were worshipped as gods; Prima Donald here has not forgotten this.
Hmmm....let them eat catnip
Off with his nuts
Game of Thrones has gone to her head.
So this is what you meant by "Must worship cats."
That's the last time you get any catnip.
Well somebody has to tell him we are getting a dog
But really--who rescued who?
Regal Cat Litter said they want to go in a different direction.
You're going to have to accept the fact that your realm extends only to your litter box.
And that is how I became King of the U.S.
This was more amusing when he was just a candidate for adoption
Weren't you scheduled to be meeting with the delegation of small, woodland creatures?
But we can't afford caviar more than twice a week.
I blame the curiosity.
We feel you're becoming a royal pain...
He's become so full of himself since his video went viral
Remember when HE would bring mice to US?
Of course you're depressed. But we're here to help put that Owl incident behind you.
The breeder said it was a Persian-Targaryen mix.
The dog is requesting a visa extension.
For your own good, we've decided there will be no more binge-watching of The Lion King.
I told you we shouldn't name him Donald.
I knew we should have gone with the popular vote.
Mittens, it's time we talk about your Game of Thrones habit.
We see your point but executing Patches is a bit harsh.
Well, he's eaten all of his loyal subjects, so what's next?
Give her credit, she did win the popular vote.
He isn't the same since that mouse told him he was naked.
She's been listless ever since the Brexit vote.
This morning he tweeted this place is a dump
How do you think we'll ever tell him that he basically has no clothes?
We shouldn't have named him Princess.
I told you the Fancy Feast was a bad idea.
He's been like that ever since Trump grabbed him.
The taxidermist really captured his essence, wouldn't you say?
Who voted for this cat?!
And to think he traded away a good horse.
Had we known, we never would have neutered you.
So "pick up the royal litter" isn't a "chair" reference?
He says he won't wear the boots until he gets his own closet
On the bright side: he is castle-trained.
This is the 5th day he has refused Tuna. Please give him his phone again.
What do you mean, you feel neglected?
We should have never let him watch The Lion King.
He's acted like this ever since his video went viral.
Can you put the throne and crown away? We have friends coming over in 30 minutes and don't want them to know who really rules this home.
I think we over did it on the Fancy Feast...
It's the tweeting that concerns us most.
Would you mind if we took a vacation?
We should have never named the cat Trump.
The Emperor has no clothes!
Look, Harry, it's 'The cat's in the cradle AND the silver spoon,' and it isn't meant to be taken literally...
We respectfully remind you that your authority is not plenary. Every effort will be made to keep Buddy out of your bowl and the Bashful Box. There can be no execution.
I told you not to give him canned food.
He's been like this ever since seeing the Lion King.
I've talked with Mildred Peirce. Her cat Max had a problem with catnip abuse.
We feel, Mr. Miffles, that, as the family pet, you are entitled to our best truth; so Bruce and I felt compelled to let you know, that, fond as we are of you, and in spite of our very real affections, you're just not all that.
Domestication has taken its toll.
No, you cannot behead the dog!
Being dumped before prom isn't the worst thing in the world.
Is it true you told the pet psychic that we 'bore' you?
Honey, we shouldn't have kids.
I've always heard cats rule humans but I think he's taking it too far.
He beheaded a mouse yesterday.
Your mother was right. We should have adopted a dog.
We might have been wrong to deny him an heir.
What possible difference could one little baby make?
He's everything we hoped he'd be.
Well, the shelter did describe him as "majestic."
I told you this might happen if we named him Trump.
We are just trying to make you feel good about yourself.
You still can't go outside.
Your mother was right. All those early years of us fawning over him would eventually lead to this pathetic state of entitlement
Pardon us, your Majesty, but you're no longer able to produce an heir.
You're not alone in preferring 'The Lion King' over 'Cats.'
Our therapist said we shouldn't have a cat-centered marriage.
I think we need to cut back on his catnip.
I casually told the taxidermist he was our little prince.
I didn't realize that he was paying so much attention when we watch 'Game Of Thrones.'
Times have changed. They no longer own us. They just rule us.
Off the furniture, guys.
We're sorry, we didn't know the new kitten would stage a coup.
We regret, Your Highness, that we have not been able to find the four and twenty blackbirds for your dinner pie.
If he accepts you as one of his subjects, we can set a wedding date.
I would prefer the King Charles Spaniel.
He thinks his kitty litter don't stink
I can't believe we've been let go.
Yes He's happy but I think he's worried the mice may released the transcripts about his meeting with the Tigers.
Really, your kingdom for a mouse?
Sorry, Smokey, but cats do NOT have nine wives.
Fetch me my litter box.
Well this explains the mouse-sized guillotine.
You weren't supposed to eat the blackbirds.
at least he doesn't think he's God.
I guess checking the pet-included option on Airbnb wasn't such a good idea.
He insists we call his food dishes Camilla Parker Bowls.
We know it's a lot to ask, but if you could just see your way clear to allow us to sleep in one morning?
Heavy lies the cat.
We were wondering if it would be alright if we went out tonight?
What? Buy the boots too?
How did you think the dogs would react when you said, 'Let them drink toilet water'?
Do you think it's gout?
I suppose we were foolish to hope he'd become more kingly.
I guess we could just give her whatever she wants like other cat owners do.
Cheer up! We said de-claw, not de-throne.
I think the Fancy Feast has gone to his head.
She has been like this since November.
Everything he touches turns to tuna.
I'm worried the attention's going to his head.
He only wears the crown after he drinks too much.
Bob agrees. We would like you to shit in the little box.
Sorry, Puss, the jesters all work in the White House now.
At least she's past the Egyptian goddess phase.
NOW will you stop peeing outside the box?
My family has always named our cats "Louis." This is Louis XIV.
He will let us stay here if we pay the rent.
... and as my first order as king you will clean my litter box hourly, not weekly as you foul peasants have treated me
That's what we get for naming him "King."
Thing is, Bob doesn't like to be called "The Gentleman Scooper of the Poop Chamber
I think the Fancy Feast has gone to his head.
I should have known better than to let him binge watch reruns of "Game of Thrones."
It began to go wrong when we started buying the organic mice.
The Royal Pet Spa has given him delusions of grandeur.
Sorry, but catching a mouse will only get you so far.
I am actually more concerned about the way he's been ordering the mice to amuse him.
Do you want to tell him or should I?
We had to call off the hunt. Mice are now an endangered species.
It’s not funny—she’ll be mortified when the catnip wears off.
How about we drop the 2% and go to whole milk?
It's your turn to clean out the chamber pot.
Morning tweet from the king: For the protection of cats we will erect a tremendous dog-proof wall on all of our borders and the dogs will pay for it.
We could have a mouse beheading.
It's an abdication or divorce. You pick.
We should never have switched to Fancy Feast.
He's been taking that catnip from Amsterdam again.
He just proclaimed it's time to clean the litter box.
Pretending to be King is tiring. I do not know how Donald does it.
Most cats just THINK they rule the house!
The diagnosis is royal ennui.
It only confirms what we already knew!
Ask yourself...what would Cersei do?
You can have your iPhone back after you clean out your litter box.
Your DNA indicates you're thirty-seven percent sloth.
Hairy is the head that wears the crown.
Where did we go wrong?
He's been this way since he went paleo.
It's not Camelot if you're the only one playing.
It's always been lonely at the top.
The best thing about a live-in monarch is you don't take the one in Washington so seriously.
Your Fancy Feast days are done — back to Friskies.
Daddy, I thought I was your little princess!
But the polls were fake news!
I'm sorry, I don't know any more dog jokes.
Well, if Majesty forbids us to watch Mommy and Daddy's program, then Majesty will just have to go to bed without Majesty's 'Tender Nibbles.' Right, Paul? He'll just have to go to bed without his 'Tender Nibbles.'
But you ate all of the mice. How about some well done steak with ketchup?
We both thought family intervention was needed and have made an appointment for you with Dr. Seuss.
At least we don't have to pay for his education
But, we simply just can't banish all dogs
I knew we shouldn’t have let him read Animal Farm.
All those "views" of his YouTube videos have gone to his head.
She wants to change her name to Cersei.
didn't even make it a week in the White House; the President tweeted that he was too territorial
Catnip is a hell of a drug.
King size bed?
Heirs or no heirs, tomorrow you get spayed.
Not the royal pussy treatment I had in mind.
Maybe if we get him a smaller crown, he could at least sit up straight.
Shame of thrones.
I hate to say I told you so, but 'Rex' is a dog's name.
I think it's time we stop feeding him the fancy feast...
It was a mistake to name him Donald...
Le Meeow, c'est moi.
I told you we shouldn't let her watch 'Game of Thrones'....
He was fixed to prevent any heirs to the crown.
We won't think any less of you if you want to abdicate.
King is as high as it goes.
Don't worry, your highness, the new kitten will only be a duke.
He's a rescue from a coup de chat.
The vet says it's Advanced Feline Affluenza.
Tell us what happened to Kitty Boleyn.
Big deal,she got a mouse.
He thinks he's Donald Trump
In hindsight, maybe we shouldn't have named him Donald.
. . . or we could just let him be a cat.
Apologies, Sire, but commoners are forbidden to lick your fur for you.
They've taken away his tweeter.
It's good to be cat!
It's the ennui.
He's establishing a hierarchy I'm not comfortable with.
We promise: Nothing but locally sourced, organic treats from now on.
He's been watching National Geographic's special on lions again.
C'mon. You can tell us where the mice are hiding.
Maybe a seventeen-day vacation would help.
He couldn't care less about the mice.
Not what you expected?
Wouldn't a pair of boots be nice , too?
I just don't think we should have to pay an exterminator to get rid of the mice.
But if we let you outside and something bad does happen, what do we tell your 35k followers on Instagram?
The superhero outfit would be more slimming.
Coronation ball... dancing till the wee hours. We told you boots were the wrong choice.
I think the trust fund Mom left him is getting to his head!
The taxidermist really ran with the "regal" thing, eh?
Maybe we should get him a jester.
Shall we tell him about the baby
He learned this from you, George!
I worry he has lost touch with the people.
But he didn't win the popular vote.
I told you not to name him Trump
He staunchly refuses to abdicate.
I guess all that's missing are the boots...
We just found out he's descended from Charlemagne's cat.
I wish we were dog people
But lots of families have a cat and a dog.
I guess this get-up's not making up for getting him fixed.
Is it the ennui?
So much for switching from dry food to tuna.
But is he fulfilled?
Dry cat food is not treason.
I was hoping for a mouser.
We have decided that a goldfish would be more in line with our progressive values.
We're here to negotiate terms for Fido to return to the house.
He blames us for not preparing him to be an outside cat.
I told him he had 'nine lives'. He heard 'six wives'.
We're sorry, but the Humane Society doesn't check for claims to the throne before their procedures.
Quick, grab my pussy!
Yes, you rule the world. No, you can't be "unfixed".
Are we sure we didn't spoil him?
If it please my liege, this is my new boyfriend, Dan.
The numbers are in - your approval rating with the mice has plummeted since you ate one.
He wishes he were King of Siam.
Unfortunately, you've become so lethargic that even the mice are concerned.
Do you think if we changed the cat food it would make a difference?
It's your own fault -- YOU named him "Trump."
That had better be faux fur!
He wants to play the lead in King Richard III.
It's over. We're getting a dog.
Whose turn is it to humor me next, people?
Your appointment with the Vet should eliminate any false Paternity claims
I know you've been an only child for years, but we want you to love the new puppy too!
Well, it still SMELLS like a litter box
You suppose we could use him in an Fancy Feast commercial?
We're a democracy no more.
And, we've put the children up for adoption.
You need to find a job.
Would a little mouse pate' make you feel better?
Well, then describe how you think a more genuine apology really should sound.
He's been like that since fat cats took over the White House.
I don't know why he won't answer to Tom.
What's up Pussycat?
If it please your highness, we would like to retire for the night.
And to think he's still on his first life...
At least she doesn't tweet
You are still the king of our jungle.
Just to be clear – We bow both before and after we feed you?
The mice have revolted and demanded his abdication
And the dog's name is Rex.
A gecko beheading has taken place on the porch. Is there anything you would like to tell us?
We've been over this before. You can't smoke your pipe in here, and we can't afford to keep the fiddlers three.
The vet says he has delusions of being Donald Trump.
Your Majesty, your subjects are demanding a reduction in royal hairballs.
No more watching "Game of Thrones" for you.
We need to call Dr. Phil.
I warned you he'd become a royal pain.
Mum and Dad still love you very much.
We'll give you back your Twitter when you stop behaving like a cat.
It's supposed to be "raining" not "reigning".
Yours really is a royal pain in the ass.
I'm feline mighty fine.
He is not amused.
We're sorry. The laser battery is dead.
I think it was a mistake to feed him 'Pedigree' all these years.
"So how long is your palace being renovated for?
We promise not to watch Game of Thrones without you ever again.
We no longer have room in our lives for your ego.
Another tax on the dog?
Suppose we said "please."
You just had to name her Queen.
I told you Rex was a bad name for a cat.
Why don't you just play with string?
Your taxidermy skills are impressive, but I'm taking my cat and leaving. Don't call me for a second date.
Concentrate--the audition is tomorrow. It's 'Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown', not 'Purr, purr, purr'
Henry started acting a little peculiar when he'd used up 8 of his lives
Are you sure this is what she meant by cat sitting?
OhTrumpcat, I'm sure things will get better.
I thought it would make our living room great again.
When we get him declawed, maybe we can get him dethroned as well?
We have gold plated the litter box, sire. Have you any further commands?
Can I get you anything else? A mouse, a bird, a lizard?
I don't think he took the idea of getting a dog very well.
We changed it to Caturday, what else can we do?
He who has never learned to obey can ever be a good leader.
Henry the Ninth
I knew we should have gotten a dog.
The YouTube royalties have really gone to his head
The new kitten, like us, will just be part of your Court; nothing else, we promise.
maybe we should have had kids.
No, we can't let you kill all the dogs in the neighborhood
How did your audition for Game of Thrones go?
Sorry. There just aren't any sequels to Cat in the Hat.
We're thinking of switching you back to kibble.
We are telling you for the last time, Game of Thrones is not real and I will not kill the neighbour's cat because you said so.
We're getting a dog.
He's been like this since the dog died.
Think we should cut back on the foie gras?
But you won the popular vote in this house.
We'll appeal to his Instagram fan base to kick it off right after the indictment..
Honey, we'd like to talk about your attitude.
If I...were the king...of the foooootreeeeeeeest!
Please let us go outside...we promise not to jay walk...or get into any fights.
invading the johnsons is fraught with danger, your majesty. They have dogs.
He's an indoor cat.
Let's not pussy-foot around anymore. It's time for a coup!
Would a Fabergé scepter cheer you up?
Maybe we should have gone with a rescue, instead of a purebred.
About your royal licking...
Oh no. Our fat cat is tired of winning too.
You should see the cat box!
Yes, we got a kitten, but think of it as succession planning.
He claims he has a divine right for his favourite spot.
2 million Facebook views and 3 million Instagram views is not enough, master?
We actually bought this cat?
Looks like Cat King Cole has been into the catnip again.
Well, I guess this makes it official.
Where did we go wrong?
Trump's influence is everywhere.
What did I say about feeding him Fancy Feast?
Please, we've done everything you asked, now where's Fido?
Yes, you killed your father and slept with your mother, but it's our fault for naming you Rex.
I don't think "here kitty, kitty" is goin' to work.
We were thinking you might like a dog to hiss at.
The Donald called, he wants his crown back.
I dare you to scratch the royal belly.
We should lay off the Fancy Feast for a while.
I knew he was going to London to visit the Queen, but I didn't expect this.
Apparently the Lobster Au Gratin had overtones of mouse.
He has been this way every since he licked the Imperial margarine.
His Highness appears to be catatonic.
I told you we should have gotten a dog.
Maybe we're actually dog people.
When they came up with the bit about "nine lives," they didn't factor in the six wives.
In the end it will be his mewbris that brings him down.
When did it start being all about him?
Apparently he was next in feline of succession.
You're the one who asked the Genie to give us something better than the government we have today.
Yes, you have nine lives, but you were not a king in your past life. That's not how it works, Tommy.
Should we return him to Mar-a-Lago.
Do you think we spoil him?
So, do you still want to move in?
You were playing dress-up with Prince Charles again today, weren't you?
-Are you SURE you still want kids ?
I think he needs to start dating.
He's just living up to his potential . . . You should try it. DEAR!
We're sorry, but we cannot allow you go rule our home the way Trump rules the government
I think it was the case of margarine.
I think one of your hairballs has lodged in your brain.
He never realized that being president meant no more naps.
I admit it; I bought the throne. But I don't know where crown and the cape came from....
One chocolate mouse too many.
I think the pampering backfired.
What are we, chopped liver?
The vet suggested we switch back to dry food.
We may have spoiled her with that new canned food.
Does this mean we're in the dog house?
I'm tired of all the winning!
Look, Schrodinger -- two new leather sofas.
Listen, everyone will have to make sacrifices for the puppy.
And maybe someday, you will get the lead in that Broadway play, but for now, I need you to continue to use the litter box.
Only one more season, your grace.
The bad news is that your life as a king is over. The good news is that you have 8 lives left!
I'm sorry, sweetie. When he said "Grab 'em by the pussy" he didn't mean your kind.
perhaps we should release him back into the wild?
Wow, truffles, that was, like, the biggest, baddest mouse in, like, the entire history of the city.
The breeder said his name is Cat King Cole.
We're sorry, Rex, but pooping on the carpet is not a royal prerogative.
The regalia isn't the problem. The taxidermy is.
'"Aww...has Princess had a bad day?"
The mice voted for Brexit just to spite you.
"Dogs are awesome, but cats rule.
Why does he have to keep reminding us?
That's not what we meant by "go sit on the throne".
Look, we named you His Royal Supremeness, Lord of All, the Great Purr, as a joke, more or less.
What good is a crown when you're missing your orbs?
We are going to start treating you like a cat.
I think I would have preferred him stuffed in a more-natural setting.
We don't like what Royal Canin and Fancy Feast has done to you. We're switching you back to Meow Mix.
Please pardon us your Grace; we were fools to plan a vacation without you.
But Honey, everyone knows that cats rule.
Per your instructions, essential oil of mouse hearts has been added to your scratching wall and litter pool.
Perhaps his majesty would be feeling a little better if he hadn't just scarfed down all of daddy's boeuf bourguignon.
Louis is bored.
This is why Trump shouldn't have been President!
Your boyfriend smells like a dog person.
We should have had a kid.
Is he really an enchanted prince or does he just have an attitude?
May we sit here or should we kneel?
I have a feline this isn't going to work out. I may have to flea.
Pawns!
So, what makes you think Mischief can play  golf any time he pleases?
...so after you frightened the little mouse under her chair, the Queen did WHAT?
I say we just go back to the boots . . . .
Can you tweet about something else? How about the joys of self hygiene, and mice (but not men)?
Let them eat chicken. Hell, let them eat liver too.
OK. We have taken care of the dog.
There's no way this is a phase.
I wanted to name him "Pumpkin." But Nooooo -- you insisted he was going to be "Simba." There's no going back now.
The mice are definitely outnumbered... but they have dragons.
He claims to be a direct descendant of Simba, the lion king.
It's still kitty litter and it's not going to change itself.
It's "L'etat c'est moi," not "L'etat c'est meow."
We've got a pipe and a bowl, but where can we find fiddlers three?
Who died and made him king?
I think we need to change your catnip.
You went to London to visit the Queen, and then?
For the last time, they are not doing a sequel to "Cats."
There is no easy way to say this, we are getting a dog.
I told you Game of Thrones would be a negative influence on our family.
I prefer the term Enlightened Despot.
I told you we shouldn't have let him watch Trump on TV.
Of course we love you, but you're still not a dog.
Who's going to tell the emperor he needs new clothes?
OK, so your past life regression therapy revealed you've had eight previous lives...
Your turn to be Master of the Queen's Litter Box.
When you said you were getting the King Louis a throne, I thought you meant a new litter box.
Please! We'll never let it happen again.
I thought it was just a phase.
...and how is this supposed to improve our sex life?
She hasn't given you permission to sit yet.
Prince Rusty looked out the window today, the female backyard cats were laughing at him .
What if we decided not to serve?
When he moves his right foot to the left, he wants Tender Vittles.
For the last time, Oliver, you're not a king and this is not a jungle!
Dear, do you think his expectations are excessive?
We know you're disappointed, but there's no way you can be 'top dog'.
From now on, she wants to be called, "Miss Puddytat Lion-born of House Purrgareyan, First of Her Name, Queen of the Seven Cul-de-sacs, the Unspayed, Mother of Kittens."
I hope now you see why I wanted to get a dog.
Princess is just a name, not a title!
Don't take this wrong, but we're adding a couple of Dobermans to our family.
No, honey, you wanted to name him Trump!
It's not me; it's your cat.
I'm so sorry. I should have discussed it with you before I got pregnant.
Before adopting Mr. Nibbles we thought Machiavelli's The Prince was satire.
We thought you should know that Winter is coming, He's a Great Dane/Boxer mix.
As your advisors, we thought all the catnip was getting in the way of your official duties.
I can’t believe we now have a malignant narcissist at home
If he says 'Hakuna Matata' one more time...
I don't think, "Let them eat tuna," is going to win you any friends in your cat kingdom.
We sense a keen disappointment in all that you survey.
Although we could continue to pledge our undying loyalty to you, there remains a remarkable temptation to have you put to sleep and replace you with a puppy.
You can go on trying to "Make Cats Great Again" ... just not here.
Your mother and I would like to know how you plan to pay for four kittens?
"Uneasy lies the crown eh Whiskers?
Would you rather have my mother move in?
We watched "Game of Thrones" all weekend, and when I returned from work on Monday, he was like this.
They say that getting a dog will solve the problem.
I wonder what his next 8 will be like
Game of Thrones will be on in a week, there's got to be something you can do with yourself until then.
I want a divorce.
"Bla bla bla" is all they ever say. Do they not see my robe? My throne? My Royal Crown?!?
Historically kings often die early: syphilis, the plague, beheading. So there is hope.
Just because you won the Miss Kitty USA contest it doesn't mean that some cretin isn't going to try and grab you!
I don't care, you still have to use the litter box"
It was a mistake to make him an indoor only cat.
Yes of course you are King of the Jungle. it's just that your jungle was reclaimed by civilization.
"King Lear" is just your name; not your identity.
Frankly, the early morning hairballs undermine your authority, your highness.
It all started with the cat nip.
Do you mind if we sleep with you in your bed tonight?
'The Lion King' is just a story - Simba isn't coming.
OK, agreed. We give you more treats and you give us more territory.
I don't think inheriting all Aunt Ella's money has changed Snowball, do you?
realizing you're cat has a problem is the first step.
Please, may we please change the channel from Fox News?
Isn't this a bit much for killing one stray mouse
Let me guess, Mr. Wiggles' DNA test results arrived?
I'm stopping his Fancy Feast subscribe & save tomorrow.
We are not getting you another rat court jester. You've eaten the last three!
Generations of inbreeding.
Does Your Majesty Whiskers III know who left the dead mouse by the pantry?
I warned you that you wouldn't be able to sleep 16 hours a day if you were king.
When we named you Cat King Cole, it was just a play on words.
Well, you're the one who spoiled him with the canned food!
You had to know the Mouse Guards would turn against you once you ate their leader.
When Your Highness craps in daddy's shoe it makes mommy very sad.
He insists we call him Rex now.
His highness isn't happy with the new litter box.
I don't care what your mother says. I did not give him too much catnip when he was a kitten.
He does know that you can't just be king, you have to do something, right?
I'm sorry, Tom, I thought he was asleep and the kids wanted to watch The Lion King... I didn't know...
Maybe we shouldn't have named him 'King.'
They captured his eyes spot on! What do you think honey?
Of course your member of the family, just not the"Royal"family!
He has no intention of sharing his authority
How much was this litter box?
As far as I'm concerned, you're both in the doghouse.
Would it please his majesty if mummy scratched his belly?
OK, so he's not qualified. What's our next step?
We're moving to an apartment that doesn't allow kings.
Help us Sir, the mice are revolting.
Even the cat is in to Game of Thrones
If cats could talk, they probably wouldn't.
I could've sworn that I ordered Seuss' 'Cat in the Hat,' but Amazon delivered this!??
You may be orange, but that's no reason to act like Donald Trump.
I dunno. Says he's under audit and won't release his tax returns
It's the worst case of White Cat Privilege I've ever seen.
So you looked at the King. What next?
Honey, the Game of Thrones binging is really starting to impact the whole family.
We didn't know the costume would induce delusions of dander.
He thinks he's king of the jungle.
Don't you think you are taking this "king of beasts" a little far?
Declaring a travel ban on dogs is not really a good idea at this time, your majesty.
Would'st thou consider using the litter box next time?
No, Dad. It's not a good substitute for a King Charles Spaniel.
We just want what's best for you.
No, we can't banish all dogs from the kingdom, though we can give Your Majesty a soft chin scratch.
We need a dog.
I told you we shouldn't have let him watch "Game of Thrones".
She's not that into you.
I know your video got 1 million views but don't you think you've taken it too far?
We're sorry that Princess Fluffy didn't meet your expectations.
Please, your Highness, just acknowledge our presence.
I'm not gonna sing you the song from the King and I again.
Yes, but you descended from ferals.
I told you from the start I'm a dog person
I bought the whole outfit on that website for childless couples.
With all due respect Sire, the proverb says only that a cat can LOOK at a king.
We should have never named him Henry!
Would you like extra mice to top your tuna casserole majesty?
Having ruled for many years, Tibbert grew tired of his servants.
Could we maybe try a constitutional monarchy for a while?
I think the imported salmon is helping with his self-esteem issues
Oh well, we may as well face it. The KITTEN is gone . . . Long Live The Cat.
He doesn't have to spell it out, we're not idiots.
If you remember I wanted to call her Puffy Boo, but you insisted on Queenie.
You were right, Bob. Catnip and power don't mix.
I wouldn't mind if he hadn't beheaded the dog.
I told you not to give him tuna.
I still think we should have cremated him.
The mouse king refuses your suit for the hand of his daughter.
What do we do, she still isn't satisified
Indifference and fresh salmon are killing you.
Do you think it's because we named him Donald?
We have to tell him that the corgi was just visiting
He keeps saying, "I'm King of my castle!"
We wish we could afford the premium cat food, but for now this is the best we can do.
I adopted him from a no-coup shelter.
because your cousin is the king of the jungle, you are indeed in the line of succession.
I know we are using a tax loophole, but don't you think he is going too far with this Head of Household status.
I'm sorry, it's just not in the budget to stay at Mar-a-Lago.
Trust me. This could be a thing. Bigger than Facebook.
Cheer up, snookems, we're very close to choosing a new queen.
The dogs have abdicated.
He didn't know being king could be so complicated.
Fuzzy is the head that wears the crown. Oooh fuzzy wuzzy wuzzy.
Please cheer up, Rocko. We're sorry we had you neutered.
Maybe we never should have gotten him fixed.
When he's controlling the remote - that's when we cross the line.
Even if we got rid of the crown and all the other regalia, would anything else really change here?
I didn't have the heart to tell him in another life he actually had been elected President.
Of course he's sad,he ate his jester.
I think this whole power trip thing started after you mentioned his small hairball size.
In three years he will quit tweeting and your videos will be #1 again.
What do you suppose happened?
Just because you're the king of the castle does not mean you can rule with an iron paw.
Buying her Fancy Feast turned out to be a slippery slope.
We told you Healthcare wasn't easy
Your turn to escort His Majesty to the litter box.
Cheer up - it's not like I'll be having a litter.
Remember when he used to hide under the bed?
We should have dethroned before we declawed.
A million YouTube subscribers does not make you the boss of us.
This millennial thing is going too far.
Naming you Henry doesn't mean your heir to the British throne.
I said I can do an impression of a Meerkat, Broadway said we'll do a Shakespearean musical called King Lear, Cat.
We've explained for years. The Wiz isn't coming back.
We want to break this to you gently. You're being replaced by a King Charles Cavalier puppy
He hasn't been the same since he learned it's not a monarchy.
He's always been king. Now he is just making it official.
We understand, it IS upsetting that your subjects can't see your new clothes.
Yes, I suppose I did say that cremating him would be nuts.
It's okay Mr. Chips. It was just a matter of time before Chance the Rapper got more views than your youtube channel.
We know you and Buddy are fighting, but 'off with his head' seems a bit harsh.
Inventing Snap-Cat really went to his head!
He's been like this ever since that Russian Blue next door left the rat for him.
Ennui. You know...the opposite of what you feel when you threaten the mice with nuclear holocaust.
Heavy is the cat that wears the crown...
I checked online. Your scepter should arrive tomorrow.
I think it's time to get a dog
I take it winning the "Anchovy Challenge" wasn't as much fun as you thought it might be.
We probably shouldn't have given him this much power.
I think nine was one too many....
I said you could buy her a bowtie.
Look, we're kidding when we address you as Your Highness.
Sorry, the boots needed new soles
His Highness desires a totalitarian dictator rodent to amuse him.
Please don't worry, Princess, we will be here to serve you for all of your lives.
After he went viral he totally changed.
You must forget her! Your subjects will never accept a toy poodle as their queen.
Chin up. Making litter great again IS hard!
You used to rule with an iron paw.
Honey, I think it's time you stopped showing the cat The Lion King.
Don't worry we will find you another pair of boots!
Sorry, your Highness, while we're away Jenny next door won't be courtseying when she comes to clean the litter box.
No. He's not surprised.
He's feline good so I want to change his name to James Brown.
Hopefully now he'll stop scratching the couch
Don't be so sad. Next time we'll remember to have them pack any leftover sushi for you.
You mentioned fancy feast so I dressed for the occasion
Will your majesty be dining on the kibble?
With posture like that, sire, you're going to get a 'kingk" in your back!
I just think the world is ready for the title "King Pussy".
Who knew cat care was so complicated?
You ARE the best kitty. Magnificent. Probably the best since Simba.
She's depressed because she thinks it's a demotion.
Maybe we shouldn't have named him "Rex."
You mean we have to put up with him 9 more lifetimes
We're concerned this career move is a bit unrealistic.
We know about the catnip.
I asked for a Kit Kat Bar, not a King Cat Czar.
Maybe we should have had that child instead.
Dear, could I be queen for a day?
He said that now that he's in his eighth life he wants to turn over some of his royal responsibilities to us.
It's like entertaining royalty without the pomp.
After receiving the cat ancestry results: "He's really taking this whole Cornish Rex thing very seriously"
I think your obsession with Game of Thrones has gotten a little out of hand.
Seems like purring after praise is exhausting.
I think we're stuck with him.
I think all the fancy feast has gone to his head
I think there's something in that new Trump brand cat food.
We ARE sitting.
No one can replace her. When her time comes, we'll have to form a republic.
King Mittens still looks catatonic.
Did he just tell us to bend the knee??
We pick up the new puppy tomorrow.
We really do live in an era where pussy is king.
Well, what did you expect when you gave him the throne?
We have to stop feeding him Fancy Feast.
`Trying to emulate that orange, wanna be dictator you see on tv does not make you president of this house."
Please we are begging to know; which one of us do you like better?
We're sorry, but it seems the dog has started a republic.
You're here and the mice still play.
So, tell us again how you think you actually won the popular vote even after your coronation.
I don't even want to think of what he will be in his next life!
Well, it is the cat's world. We're just allowed to live in it.
I can't believe he ate the whole thing!
Define rescue.
Bootsie, we are not your servants.
If it please Your Highness, I could go get the laser pointer.
We should never have let him watch "The Lion King."
I couldn't care less who gets custody.
Being a fat cat is overrated.
It's not your fault health care is so complicated.
'I vote for naming him Trump,' you said. 'Let's shake things up a little,' you said.
Are you sure the dog died of natural causes?
It was all fun and games till he banished the dog.
And he still insists he should have won the popular vote.
I know that cats consider themselves regal, but this is ridiculous!
Fluffy binge watched "Game of Thrones"again
It's good to be king.
We let you exile the dog but we cannot allow you to annex the neighbor's back yard.
How about a bigger throne? Or maybe a scepter--would a scepter help?
We're going to have get a bigger litter box.
Sometimes I feel like you care more about him than me.
Your Grace, we request you use the litter box next time.
Just because we named you Donald.......
I guess we overdid it in the enhanced catnip
Impressive. And he still has 8 lives.
One pound of catnip and he thinks he's King Trump
I told you the crown would help him forget that we had him fixed.
I swear that all we discussed was adopting the kittens.
At least he has decided whether he wants to be in or out.
He knows he's funding our retirement through those cat videos you shot when he was a kitten.
I guess when he brought us home, he never thought we would be this much work!
One canary too many.
We should have never named him Donald.
It's just a conspurracy theory. Nothing to lose a life over.
Her Meowjesty has graciously unspooled the toilet paper again.
Let's hope he's not above hunting the common mouse
With that cape and crown, you look like a self-centered narcissist. You should run for president.
He seems to be trying to tell us what we already know.
Being King of the Household ain't all it's cracked up to be, is it?
We understand your trauma, we are shocked too to learn that your Father was a Tomcat...
It was your idea to call him Rex.
He says the litter box needs more jewels.
You see, our feelings for you are merely the result of Stockholm syndrome.
It's an exhausting job? Maybe it's the tweet all-nighters.
Well, he did win the Electoral College.
We should have had a kid.
I knew it all along, it's just official now.
Cersie, next time we don't throw the dog off the roof . . .
We never should've fed her the fancy feast.
I draw the line at his own Twitter account.
Listen, we get it. Heavy is the head that eats the tuna.
The court appointed psychiatrists called us insane. What does Your Majesty say?
Oh, My Liege, wouldst pray purr if thou art pleased with thy minions' service?
Please, where did you hide the human-nip?
I told you, the dog doesn't want to be your jester.
That's right; regardless what we've called you all these years, technically we are NOT actually your subjects.
What's your take? Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown, or it's really not good to be the king?
He wants a special feast tonight.
Is the throne not as comfy as the radiator, My Lord?
Shall we bring in the Mouseketeers or Pug the Jester?
We want you to know that our getting a dog will in no way change your status in our household.
Salmon, it's all we have left.
Yes, fixed means you can't make princes.
OK The dog is dead. What next?
Now that we've crowned you King, may we have permission to rub your belly, Your Highness?
Listen Fluffy, this whole King of the Jungle phase you're going through is getting out of hand.
Having only 8 lives is STILL something to be proud of, princess.
Maybe binge-watching 'Game of Thrones' wasn't such a good idea.
It was your idea to name him DJ Trump!
This is a royal pain in the ass.
Abdication is not an option?
Boots?" "Remember the dog ran away with your boots!
Rex, it's not ED. You had a procedure when you were very young.
Have you tried past life regressions?
We crossed the line with "lobster night ".
Why cats will rule the world
His YouTube video went viral.
His Royal Highness prefers the term plus-size over fat.
Peel another mouse for you sire?
Chicken or fish, my liege
No, the mice cannot come over to play.
I don't care what you think ... he's not spoiled.
We're sorry Vermont said they don't need a king.
To think he was once a pure- bred, lean, mean, mouse-killing machine.
At dawn Ralph and I will be taking you to a place of our choosing, and thereupon and at such time you will be hung by the neck until you are dead.
Smile, we found your Boots.
You keep telling me my pussy rules.
She just heard Trump has a pussy.
Now this is strong evidence of a royal catnipshin.
Henry needs an heir.
Your Highness, our whole situation is Catastrophic.
As you can see, he was disappointed in the court jester.
Sorry, you were a sweet little kitten when we named you 'Fluffernutter'
No, YOU grab the pussy
I'm thinking it's time we broke the news to the Emperor. Again.
He says bow the knee or kiss the curtains goodbye.
It’s time to talk about the dog.
I'll say it one more time. Wild-caught, not farm-raised.
I promise he won't be too much trouble. He cleans up after himself and he won't eat your food.
She finds our cat box humiliating.
We thought if we told you right away, you'll have nine whole months to get use to it.
The vet's narrowed it down to menarche or monarchy.
Apparently it's the new 'cat's pajamas' according to the vet.
I can think the Instagram success has gone to his head.
Maybe Your Majesty wasn't such a great name Dear...
The vet says we should not allow him to watch any more Trump press conferences
You have to stop watching the Lion King. It's not good for your self esteem.
You can be Old King Cole in your next life.
Since he got the part, he's impossible to live with.
Fret not! The catnip will be here within the hour!
I could have him declawed but never dethroned.
Yes, it was your turn, but now its Richard's turn
As s long as we give her catnip and Caesar's liver she doesn't destroy our curtains.
Let's call him Donald.
We're sending you to catnip rehab!
Fat cats always lean to the right
Rex next door says royalty or not, he will continue to chase you.
Yet he still maintains that the election was "fixed".
Don't act like you swallowed the canary with us.
Really, "off with their heads" is all you can say for yourself?
Now I see why you named our kitty, "trumpy"
We wanted you to know that Parliament has elected a Prime Minister, and the breeder is bringing him tomorrow.
I think we better cut off (s)he from Game Of Thrones
I will just have you two refer to me from now on as the greatest American fat cat ever.
No! It's against the Constitution!
Don't worry your highness. When we say FIX, nothing of yours is broke.
I think the mouse catching has gone to his head.
There are lots of 'kings of the jungle', but you're the only king of the apartment.
He took this rat king thing way too seriously.
The vet told him he has no clothes that's what's up with him.
I liked your kangaroo get-up better.
At least he doesn't spray anymore
I said "vermin," but Rex heard "ermine."
Some merry old soul !
We're getting a dog.
I'm starting to miss the mice.
Bring me the dog's head.
The power (and the catnip) have clearly gone to his head.
Maybe being king of the cats is not all it's made out to be.
He really guilted me after the neutering.
We felt you should be the fist to know, I am pregnant
You were totally right - "Taxidermy On A Throne" was the way to go.
So, only sushi-grade fish, medium-rare steak and filtered water? Did I miss anything?
Matthew's only coming home for a week. Then it's right back to school with him, I promise.
Don't despair, dear -- there MUST be someone else you can fire.
Now that he's cornered the entire catnip market he's completely lost all motivation.
I don't want a second cat, either, but we're gonna need a Brutus.
Despite your decree you still have to use the littler box.
Sorry, but no more Fancy Feast. We're putting you back on Meow Mix.
YOU wanted to name him Louis.
But honey, I'm sure your real mother loves you just as much as we do.
I told you he was a British Shorthair
Noble, yes, but lazy.
Isn't he taking this Ser Pounce thing a bit far?
Canned or raw?
We need to talk about you laissez-faire approach to the litter box.
She's completely conquered us and now she's bored.
No, David, the lawyers were adamant, under Aunt Agatha's will Queenie owns everything.
He is probably thinking this place is a dump.
Maybe a seatbelt would help.
We're here to serve you. We get it.
We should have gone with the dog jester
This isn't what we meant when we asked you to 'go medieval' on the mice.
How exhausting it must be to preside over an entire kingdom that's aloof.
This all started when you insisted on that damn organic catnip from the farmer's market.
A dog? This will be the downfall of the Persian Empire!
It looks like his princely duties are taking a toll.
Dogs have masters, cats have servants
This is what happens when you put pussy on a pedestal.
The President called. He needs another fat cat in his Cabinet.
As your therapist, I feel your inability to purr is do to a lack of contentment.
I knew naming her 'Princess' was a risk.
Maybe we should try Craigs List.
Boots? Really?
Do you think we've spoiled Mr Fluffington?
No...we really mean it. We are blessed and privileged to have the honor of feeding you and changing your litter.
Maybe we should cut off his "Fancy Feast" and go back to "Friskies".
It's our fault. The shelter told us he was a bit demanding.
The Fancy Feast has really gone to his head.
He says it's 'for a podcast.'
Ah,don't fret, you'll always be king in our jungle.
We should never have named him 'Henry VIII'.
We shouldn't have put the Imperial margarine on his tuna.
I told you cats can be a royal pain...
We need to talk to you about your cattidute.
"It's a dog-eat-dog world" is just an expression! They aren't planning a coup.
Could we be contributing to his insolence and pomposity
"Everything was going great, The Castle, Harem, Gold Treasures......Then she left me for a common house cat and got it all!
I still think a dog would have been more work.
We're thinking of getting a puppy.
He's depressed - the litter was all female which means 9 royal weddings an no heir.
Well, the Egyptians did treat them like royalty.
Muffin, Tom and I would like to sleep together tonight ... without you.
Oh, stop being such a big pussy and royal pain-in-the-ass!
What if I warm your milk AND make John here deliver it in crystal?
I'm glad to see it's a working vacation.
We're concerned about how your growing Insta-fame is affecting your attitude around here, Mittens.
I told you we should have had him fixed.
No more 'Game of Thrones' for you, Mr. Whiskers!
The ennui set in after the 7th life
The vet said his Lion King delusions will pass with time.
Peel me a mouse, naves
We give him a reward for catching six mice and it goes right to his head.
Dogs and politicians all banished! Are you happy now?
Abdication? Well yes, the dog has been waiting for years.
Please forgive us, the foot stool is on it's way!
There is just no pleasing him.
Well, OK. But you two have to walk it, and keep it off our bed.
Should we skip 'Game of Thrones' this week?
I'm not saying I don't like your cat Howard; I'm saying all kings are foes of the men they rule.
Trust me. Odds are, he'll go slumming all night, and you'll never see him again.
We never should have rented "The Lion King."
From reality TV star to, well, TV reality.
Your Majesty, may I suggest "ennui" is insufficient cause to desert your mousing duties?
I thought this would be funny, but it really isn't.
Must be the THC-infused catnip.
How many mice does he expect us to catch?!
They say he won the popular vote.
Spoiled? I don't know what you mean.
We're getting a divorce.
It's no use, the Queen has always liked dogs.
Leo, we just know you're going to love having a little human baby brother.
Did we catch ennui, or were we born with it?
It all started when we bought him that iPad.
Think of it as the heirball to the throne.
We want to discuss your attitude.
Hail The Lying King!
OK, your meow-jesty.
His analyst suggests we try more groveling, less pampering.
The cat in the hat sat for a chat
We weren't talking about actually getting a dog.
The King of the Beasts needs his litter box changed.
Ohh, poor little kitty. You must be so tired after that long phone call with the president of Mexico.
This is no ordinary lethargy. Only yesterday he was singing Cole Porter.
Don't worry; Game of Thrones may still have an Andrew Lloyd Webber finale.
I just can't ignore the cat in the room.
Of course she's upset. She just ate all of her heirs.
Well the weather forecast did say it's reigning cats and dogs.
Some bad news, Caesar. Seth is leaving and I'm trading you in for a gecko.
Can you imagine if he were an outdoor cat?
Your "King of the Jungle" needs to diet.
Think she was one of the pussies grabbed by Trump?
We thought you knew king was just your name
Can you please go catch him a mouse?
"It's Daddy's turn to be the King".
We serve at his pleasure but there's no pleasing him
Blame the media all you want, but they're the ones who made you a fat cat in the first place.
Now that we've got this settled, where do we stand on that hamster I've been wanting?
He's torn between 'CATS' and 'Lion King'
Look, we understand how to you our one bedroom apartment may seem like a castle.
And how do you feline about that?
I keep telling you, dogs have Owners, cats have Slaves.
There are just some character flaws that courture can't overcome.
That's not what the "King of the Jungle" looked like online.
The jester doesn't make house calls.
We gave him "Royal" brand catnip. I thought "side affects" was just a misprint on the the warning label.
Perhaps we've been too indulgent...
Now can we bury him?
We should never have named him "King"....
Looks like the crown is going to his head.
Sorry bub but when you left the jungle the rules changed.
The other cats ignored you?
I tried... the mice refuse to bend the knee.
Your father and I wanted you to know...you're adopted.
We're sorry, but this is the biggest throne we could afford. Really.
Iams what Iams.
Sire, is there not one royal feather toy worth holding onto?
Well, aren't you the cutest little tyrant.
Yes, even the king has to use the litter box.
He won't eat unless I address him as 'sire.'
Heavy is the head that ate my whole apple pie.
Well, OK then. Why don't we start with your mother.
Don't give up on us Boswell, we're trying hard to find you the right food.
No, it can’t always be ‘spur of the moment,’ but we’ll be your opposable thumbs—we’ll tweet for you.
Get over it - you'll have eight more abdications.
He had the computer mouse for dinner.
We see you've mastered the Feline Recline.
He hasn't been the same since we let him watch Lion King.
I'm sorry King Fluffy. When I called you 'Princess' I meant it as a term of endearment.
I told you not to start feeding him Fancy Feast.
Puss in Boots is one thing, but wearing a crown, draped in a cloak and lounging on a throne is quite another. What were you thinking of? A subject for Jeff Koons?
She's been like this ever since I told her that 'Queen for a Day' went off the air years ago.
OK, more foie gras and deli turkey it will be then.
He says, "Now is the winter of our discontent. Rub my tummy."
At our request, parliament also adopted a no kitties on the counter rule.
Sorry, sire. You've executed the last of the dogs.
It's good to be the cat
The vet thinks we spoil him.
His ascension was so sudden. I had no idea Queenie was on her last life.
Um, how many lives do you have left?
We should have stopped when you were president.
What do you mean we're just "fake news"?
You're not fat and lazy. That's fake mews.
Do you think his diet is too rich?
We got rid of the dog. Can't we keep the kids?
So Fritz, today we'd like to talk to you about empty nest syndrome.
I thought he'd be happy once we got rid of the dog.
I'm afraid that naming him 'Donald' was a big mistake.
He lives the puuuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrfect life.
I'm not pussy whipped.
Your meow is my demand.
So nobody ever told you about the French Revolution, your Highness?
When he gets to know you, you can crawl forward - slowly - with head bowed.
Not my King!
The emperor prefers no clothes.
He was thin and shy until his video went viral.
Darling, do you think Puss is getting too big for her own boots ?
Your Majesty, the mice are rebelling and we are running out of tuna. What do you wish us to do?
The White House is nice, Your Majesty. When can we go to Meow A Lago?
We're out of mice. Will robins do?
We told you it was going to be hard being king.
But the residuals from his kitten videos keep coming in.
Maybe if we elevated the throne?
...and that's the reason you haven't produced an heir.
How could anyone not be a cat person?
I thought we agreed we were just getting him neutered
Pussy says you grabbed her.
It's a House cat.
We both sincerely apologize for calling you a royal pain.
I don't think he realized that being royal would be so exhausting.
Never in a million years did I think I'd end up as a cat counseling major.
He's finally dressing the part!
How do we break it to him that he is a co-equal third branch of this family?
His father was in real estate. He's never scratched or clawed for anything.
My kingdom for a sandbox right about now.
Dog people are so emotionally needy.
Cat's people.
It looks like "King Putty Tat" has been in the liquor cabinet again.
Maybe we shouldn’t have named our kitty Donald.
But its good to be king!
I suggested a DNA test, but he said it wasn't necessary.
The "millennial" breed name should have tipped us off.
Better do as he says or he'll take us to obedience school again.
I am sorry, I refuse to call him the meow-narch
This is a declaration of our independence
Sorry, Martha Washington ended up naming her cat after someone else.
He's been like this ever since watching that "King of the Jungle" special on the Nature Channel.
Ok, I'll clean the litter box.
Listen, can we just get you a twitter account?
Kings can't be pussies
So what if you're not king of the jungle - isn't it enough to be king of our hearts?
What is love without respect? And what is respect without three cans of tuna?
I know, you know, everyone knows I'm just a figurehead.
Heavy is the head that wears a crown.
Honey, it's time to buy that dog.
What makes you think this is a cartoon?
He's been like this ever since I explained that his executive authority has been curtailed.
Maybe it would be easier to have a real child?
But you can't be a prince to everyone.
Of course this is Your Kingdom but-- it's just not possible to deport All Dogs
WE'RE TRYING, BUT YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW HARD IT IS TO FIND A FERAL VIRGIN!
You cannot keep living beyond your memes.
Please, can we keep him?
I tried treating him as an equal, but as you can see that didn't turn out well.
Do you think we should tell him , He is not revered here like he was in Egypt
Even though you are orange, there can only be one Trump
But will people watching YouTube think it's funny?
Do you think we are spoiling him?
Where are his boots?
Hey, so you killed one mouse, that's your job!
Are you sure it's just the catnip?
Please, we promise we'll be back in just a week.
I wish we had a dog.
Your majesty, the new neighbors, they have a dog.
Let's just admit that he's dead.
But your highness- "pause" for a moment- your feline family doesn't know or even care that you have five paws!"
He just couldn't wait to be king
As it should be.
This isn't the pussy I was talking about, Devin.
I'm pregnant.
I think that we've overdone the praise
See, this is what happens when you let him sleep in the bed.
We know it was your whisker on the salmon.
Too many mice?
I told you if you fed him Fancy Feast he'd get delusions of grandeur.
We just put you on the wet, wild-caught salmon food two weeks ago and now you hate it?  Maybe we would try the baked, farm-raised chicken again...
It's your turn to change the Royal Litter Box.
Your Majesty, the Royal Box is now ready for occupation.
We're petitioning for parliamentary representation.
It is real ermine, I swear.
Now he wants to be President!
I thought it was "Heavy is the head"?
He thinks we'll send him to Washington with the other fat cats.
We're sorry... we understand that you think you make all the rules...
We're sorry, but Fancy Feast is just a brand.
No, he said "L'état", not "Le chat c'est moi."
your father and I think it's time to back off Game of Thrones for a while.
Yes, we are having a baby. Please don't worry, you will always the queen.
Guess what? You're just about to have a new little sister!
I told you we shouldn't have switched him to wet food.
We've decided to get a dog.
We both love your, I'm so Trump thing, but in reality you're just a pussy.
I'm not Steve Bannon. I'm not trying to suck my own cock.
Gosh, you really do treat your pets like royalty.
We switched to clumping litter, Your Majesty.
Release the dog.
He just found out that being Top Cat means nothing.
We both know he rules the apartment. I got the crown and robe on sale.
Things were going so well until he said "You're Fired."
Bring me Hasenpfeffer!
Instead of bird tweets, shouldn't your focus be a veterinary healthcare agenda, Mr. Trumpster?
Yes, eating that margarine will put a crown on your head, but it will also make you very fat.
Most cats would be satisfied just having their picture posted on Facebook.
Ok, now that we've all calmed down a bit, let's try to figure out why Mr.Peepers may have flown away......
Ok this proves it; he does rule our house.
Do you think we spoil the cat?
I thought his "throne" was the litter box in the bathroom.
Do you think we might have over pampered him
Thanks Obama
Honey, Lion King is just "Make Believe"
In retrospect, I think I'm a dog person.
so you don't need to feel threatened that you're going to have a baby brother.
The breeder said she was a queen, but I thought he just meant she hadn't been fixed.
But there are so many adorable heirs at the shelter who need a home.
Yet another pretentious cat!
Well perhaps if we moved her litter box closer to the throne.
I think that just about says it all.
We never should have switched to wet food...
I told you MrWhiskers was a weak password for the HBO
Maybe we should have had that baby.
We shouldn't have let him watch Trump on TV yesterday.
How many YouTube views?
I'm starting to question your theories about the line of succession.
He prefers Mousse to Mice!
Before I met you, I kissed a frog. This is the prince I got.
What a terrible era in which idiots govern the cat.
If you grant us permission to have a child, please lick your right forepaw.
I guess ruling this house is a lot of work.
Who knew that ruling a Kingdom could be so complicated?
Felix found out he had been surgically altered before he became of age.
We're thinking about selling the house.
Let's call her 'Ivanka.'
We're sorry. Only humans can have superiority complexes.
It sure is tough when you are a fat cat and encounter a top dog!
She's binge watching The Crown this week.
Maybe you'd like to go out and grab a little pussy!
Do you think this might be a good time to ask for a raise?
Was that belly scratch satisfactory?
This is what always happens to the Prince of Tails when the old Queen won't abdicate.
The dogs have been taken care of, your highness.
A new Chief of Staff is in...
Sorry, Boots. CASH is king.
We need to talk about the litter throne, King Mittens.
I'm sorry, but I just don't think this will be the right answer to our rat problem.
I was so sure that our video would go viral that I forgot his scepter.
Kings don't sit like that. How do we know you're telling us the truth?
He's been like this since the Miceacarta was signed
I think he has seen Lion King one too many times...
No, the Napoleon Complex is a thing
Uneasy lies the head...
It's good to be king---meow.........
You know, maybe we should have a kid after all.
He thinks he's entitled on an evolutionary basis.
Clever idea, hon, but he still needs cat litter.
We shouldn't have named him Cole.
He's been watching too much Fox News.
The kingdom next door says you may have some heirs.
It's still a jungle, just urban.
Kids would be easier.
I know he is a dictator, but he is a benevolent dictator.
How will you solve this problem with North Korea?
It's time for your highness' pill.
He saw your Ancestry report. He knows you're Egyptian.
Let's name her 'Catleesi, Queen of Felines, Ruler of Mice.'
So you are changing your name to Cat King Cole?
The catbird seat isn't always what it's cracked up to be.
This is just to remind us that it really is all about him.
This is what we get for letting him watch Garfield.
It could be worse, he could think he's President of the United States.
I thought we were training him to use the porcelain throne.
You know, it's not a crime to abdicate.
We feel you need more work as our Emotional Support Cat.
We really are getting a dog. That isn't fake news.
He demands our loyalty.
I still don't get why they call me the cat lady.
Please sire, return his tongue.
We've given you what you wanted; now what can you do for us?
He just binge-watched Game of Thrones.
I believe he wants a Fancy Feast.
Who's going to tell him, you or me?
Now get the nail clipper.
Heavy is the meow that wears the crown.
And when you grow up, you can be King of all the jungle.
Okay, but no more sushi.
And I want Trump in big gold letters on the outside of my litter box.
I blame false praise.
'Our catnip source left town, can we interest you in never frozen Alaskan salmon?'
The taxidermist did a wonderful job with Prince.
We should have neutered him when we had the chance.
He wants a Twitter account.
We decided to enforce a tuna ban.
I know, I know, we voted for Trump too.
Maybe if you tried to just talk to him, I mean really talk.
Well..he did say the fat cats were taking over.
Let's call him Donald.
I know its not Westeros, but the Upper West Side isn't bad.
When you come from a shelter, you can't have heirs.
I know it's deflating when your subjects ignore you, but you'll always be king in our house.
Are you sure he is supposed to behave like this?
I love Leo, but I think the "King of the Beasts" should be significantly larger.
It looks like he has become tired of being the King.
The dog will no longer be a problem; we are still working on the child
It's your fault for naming him Rex.
He's been like this ever since the presidential inauguration.
maybe he needs a queen.
At least he can't tweet!
The vet said feline insecurity cases were rare but this should help.
It's simple really. He's demanding a loyalty oath or security will escort you out.
Dr. he felt invincible and then called the New Yorker
I think we should just have a kid.
Please try to understand. We loved your gift, but that chipmunk's innards were starting to smell.
If it pleases your majesty, dinner will be served after the cleaning of the royal poo box and the removal of the hairballs from the red carpet.
We can’t leave the TV on these 24 hour news channels anymore when we leave.
No, I think Edward needs to hear this as this concerns him.
It's really O.K. you're a cat, not a lion.
You have to accept that Game of Thrones is just a TV show.
We need help.
Neither one of us thinks the robe makes you look fat.
For a moment I thought it was a toad stool.
He's left us no options, we have to stage a coup.
Guess we need to brush up on our parenting skills!
Still less work than a baby...
What do mean "Royal Canin"is just a marketing brand?
We hate to tell you this, but it was a fake mouse.
I know cats rule the house but this is ridiculous!
He's been like this ever since the dog died.
He wants to go back to the alley.
Honey, I thought you locked the liquor cabinet. You know what happens His Majesty mixes his catnip with the bourbon.
I know the doctor said to get a service pet, but I'm not sure this is working.
The taxidermist I took him to is a big Game of Thrones fan.
Checkmate.
But John, we control the popular vote.
As King of the Urban Jungle, I want salmon, toast crusts and tuna for brunch, and I want it NOW.
Don't blame me -- you're the one who gave him a complex!
I knew I shouldn't have eaten the entire four-and-twenty blackbird pie...
Your Highness, the pugs are planning a coup.
....I think she looks more like a 'Hillary'
I'm not feeling it
No, we can't keep farm animals in the basement just so you can have fresh food.
Just because we call you Queenie does not mean you can order us to carry you to the litter box.
When he arrived, he said he was not a politician
I guess those cat food commercials are real.
Yes, your ancestors were kings of the jungle, but this is the 'burbs'.
So the domain name, King Tabby, is taken. You'll come up with an even better one.
Would that be a beck or a call!
I'm not sure that he's any happier, but he sure seems to have made it clear that we are his loyal subjects.
We never should never have taken him to The Lion King.
I don't care how many mice you've caught. We are not launching an assassination attempt against the neighbors' dog.
Of course, sweetie,all cats use the "royal we" and expect to be served.
But is it 'his' or 'her' royal highness?
His other throne is a sandbox.
We're happy the mouse is gone, but did you have to behead it?
We need to talk about your YouTube channel.
We named you King, but we almost named you Cuddles. Remember that.
Maybe we should have sent the taxidermist a better picture.
not so lonely at top
It would be half so bad if she'd just acknowledge us once in a while.
I know what's the problem, Lovey. The crown's too heavy, isn't it?
There's been a coup de cat. Hand over the crown.
And we would like you to be more accurate when using the Royal Litter Box.
Maybe we're dog people?
Now, this throne feels purrfect.
I just figured we might as well embrace it.
Don't you this he's taking this "Emperor's New Clothes" thing a bit too far?
We’re all here together because we want you to accept our help, your highness.
Has he always reacted to Fancy Feast in this manner?
You give them everything and they're still not satisfied...
After she gives birth, determining succession will not be easy.
Who knew? A eunuch king.
Hey , what can we do to cheer up our dear leader?...do you think a new pussy will do?
Maybe we're spoiling him?
Do you think a scepter will make him sit properly?
There's no easy way to tell you, I'm pregnant...
We concede. You do rule the roost!
Maybe the king is never wrong, but at least the king uses the litter box.
It's about that stupid box.
I call him "King of the Studio Apartment in a 5th Floor Walk Up in a Concrete Jungle."
"Gay Paree"? They stole my boots at the airport!
Clearly your king of the castle was never mentioned in your profile.
Honey, I think you've misconstrued some of my dirty talk.
So Maestro, you are the cat that ate the rat, somehow I thought you would not let it go to your head !
Tough day, Princess?
We're having a baby so we'll be needing that crown back.
Company's coming, Your Highness. We need you to go incognito for the afternoon.
Dad, I really don't think we should name him Napoleon.
Sorry I was catty this morning, Your Grace.
It's just easier this way.
Sorry, your majesty, but neutering just can't be reversed.
He is still a bit depressed, should we get him a taller chair?
I think he's depressed about the political situation.
Will his Majesty at least chase a few mice?
He requests that you make him laugh.
Would it be okay if we had a child?
We're not tasting your food.
His name is Duke, and he will be staying with us for a while...
He thinks he's the cat's meow.
Do you think Mr. Kibbles is watching too much Game of Thrones?
Remind me again why we shouldn't have kids.
Sorry Your Majesty but you can't have a chocolate souffle - you're a carnivore.
We should have never named him "Majesty".
I told you we shouldn't have bought him the throne.
Don't let that one mouse you caught go to your head.
He's docile now, but you should see what happens when I turn off Fox News.
Yes, Your Majkitty.
He's a real cat's cat.
Just tell us why you banished the owl.
Buying her that crown was a catastrophe!
Too much googling again.
Lord Biggelsworth has informed me we'll be sleeping on the cat bed tonight.
Your Highness, why don't you try an energy drink.
We can't agree who gets you in the divorce so we are making you part of the home sale.
For the last time, we're not going to get you a mouse, and we're not your subjects.
Ok, we promise. In your next life the dogs will lose.
So, it's not the jungle. But it is all you survey.
So . . . we're changing your name. We think we made a mistake naming you "Rex".
Absolute cat power corrupts absolutely
We agree to serve you but we draw the line at 'royal tasters.'
Would you like some milk to go with your caviar?
He's a terrible king. But he's just so cute.
Well, at least you're one up on Prince Charles.
We switched to canned food.
First of all, this isn't the Jungle.
Whose idea was the crown?
Stop feeding his delusions of grandeur dear. Bad enough we've got a president who thinks he's king.
His shit still stinks, you know.
Well Ken, I suppose you have proven yourself to be quite purr-suasive
I'm afraid he over indulged at the coronation celebration
He's been like this since we switched to Royal Canin Cat Food. He just lies around, dressed in this ridiculous get up, and he insists that I test his food.
You love her more than me, Hal.
Its all just a bit much
I hate to bring you bad news, sir. But, it's time to get neutered.
We, too, are happy that your outer cat matches your inner cat.
We should do something about our reaction to her personality.
No. It's King of the Jungle.
I told you we should have gotten him neutered.
This has gotten out of hand. The vet warned us about spoiling Rex and what it would lead to.
Don't be angry, I promise we will get the Royal Treats tomorrow!
Honey, you don't think we're spoiling him, do you?
We should have been dog people.
You do realize we can't afford kids now.
The Emperor has no kitty litter
He really didn't need all the trappings to prove hos point.
I knew he wouldn't be happy being King. He wants to be the Supreme Being!
So your audition for "Game of Thrones" went bad, there's always commercials.
OK, Trixie, we've met all your demands.
Lets name him Joffrey, you said. It will be cute, you said.
There, there kitty. Who knew ruling could be so complicated?
It's time we told you what happens to Joffrey.
Yes Felix he does have the same hair colour as you and yes he is the President.
Well, yes. Being a god would be a little better than being a king.
Rex is very literal.
Mr. Whiskers, it's time to discuss curtailing some of your spending habits.
I'm glad we decided not to have children
We warned you that heavy is the head that wears the crown.
...and that's why we named you "Ennui".
King Catzilla's reign will end soon. He's on his ninth life.
The kitty litter has been replaced with gold dust as you requested, your Highness.
It's your fault. You named him Trump.
Yes, you're the king! But no one is losing their head!
I wonder what the cat is thinking tonight.
Well, if you're going to take it like that, maybe you shouldn't be watching Game of Thrones.
Listen up......We're going to stop buying your damned boots.
We should try making him feel relevant again.
You know,I'm thinking maybe I would like to get pregnant.
Do you think the Vet is right when he says we're enabling hum?
He says 'Fritzie' is all over, and from now on, it's 'Cat King Cole.'
Looks like you had a full day.
It was a mistake letting him watch that Lion King DVD.
Queen for a Day obviously isn't working. Let's try Make a Deal.
Yes, it's true. You were adopted.
Has anyone even talked to the dog about all of this?
Love it
He logged on to ancestor.com and found out that he comes from royalty.
You actually told people he has no clothes?
Shouldn't we get her a bigger throne? After all, that was the biggest New York Rat I've ever seen and we live next to Trump Tower.
I'm disapointed, it still smells like a litter box.
She's pondering abdication
OK ... a purple velvet scratching post is going too far!
Is this what they mean by 'Wag the dog?'
Ok honey...I think the catnip is kicking in!
As first Valet de Chambre, you get to clean his litter box.
At least it has kept him off the couch.
I guess, like Donald Trump, he found being a monarch is not so easy
Catpeople are still people, Snuggles. And we demand certain liberties.
Your faithful subjects are here, you majesty. What is your bidding?
I'm sure the Lannisters will be delighted to hear news of your allegiance.
He's hoping to get the White House gig
You'll always be our little prince, but we're getting a divorce.
You're old enough now to know the truth.
At least the dog won the popular vote.
He even told me I wasn't worthy of wet food.
We're saving the furniture. If it never reigns, it paws.
King of the Hill? Nope, Duke of the Dumpster.
What is it we can do to live up to your unrealistic expectations?
His Majesty's Loyal Subjects make The Humble Request to tell us what flavor cat food you'll agree to eat!
Who knew ruling could be so hard?
Loyal subjects? Realm of your kingdom? No, your owners, our living room, and end to your game of throne.
It all began when he decided to make the dining area great again.
Well duh, I see the resemblance, I just think in 10 years we'll be sorry if we name him Trump
He just walked in, sat down, and hasn't said a thing for hours. I hope he's okay.
Let's have children and re-align our priorities.
THAT'S the new king of the beasts?
This is how he gets when he is about to issue a decree.
There was no easy way for us to say that you were adopted.
Let's call him Senator
No, we won't bring the litter box "directly to the throne as needed."
Humans always need so much attention.
But he's already president.
Is our little King of the Beasts glum this morning?
He began acting this way about the time the dog disappeared.
Would you consider a constitutional monarchy at the very least?
You're not a king and this is not the jungle.
Kings don't eat catnip to excess.
I told you Trump was a poor choice of name.
We're quite aware that you're not our best friend, Sire.
It appears the sickly King Snowball VIII will soon become King Snowball IX.
Okay fine, maybe I did mother him too much.
I know the divorce has been tough on you, but let's hear what Sprinkles has to say.
We told you to go easy on the catnip.
We wanted you to be old enough, so that you could understand. Henry, you were adopted.
I think we should cancel her subscription to "Human Psychology".
Bob and I are getting a dog - for us
Your name is "Roy," not "Roi."
You know what they say... Curiosity killed the humans.
He seems to be getting worse since he's been in therapy.
Just so we're clear - there will be no princes or princesses.
He's a hairless cat! You should never have told him the story of the emperor who had no clothes!
Dave, scratch my belly. Marilyn, collect the taxes.
In retrospect, we probably shouldn't have given him bottled water.
Maybe we spoil her.
We still have eight lives to go.
" I'm running low on catnip " !
You said this would just be a phase.
It was indeed a tough pageant win!
I think she's having one of her First World problems again.
You know they really are regal animals.
She's gotten everything she's ever wanted, but I draw the line at naming her top dog.
Cats don't have owners, they have subjects!
Are you still absolutely one-hundred percent positive that you want to get a dog?
You're the one who insisted on Fancy Feast.
...you wanted the sex change and got it, now you can't continue wearing the Queen's crown, you're confusing the children.
You've changed after hitting one million followers, Pumpkin.
After King Cole is done with his pipe, you know not to completely fill his bowl! Did you forget? No..., that's why the Pink Floyd and not the Fiddlers Three.
She had 7 kittens. One of them must be a male!
We understand it's "good to be the cat," but you still have to use the litter box.
Remember . . . it all started a year ago with that fancy collar, and now we're having to get her freakin' sand from the beach at Monte Carlo. Yes, I think you could definitely say we've spoiled her!
Next time let’s just go with a nice urn.
Mommy and daddy are very disappointed in your behavior. Eating Timmy's hamster is a big no thank you.
Sire, the royal litter box is ready.
Yep, I think he's ready. Now we just have to wait 'til the 2020 election.
Don't worry, Princess. He won't try to grab my pussy.
I know you're bored, but vanquishing the schnauzer in 3C is ill-advised at this time.
Maybe your abdication was a bit hasty,you have three more lives left at least.
this came free with the new TV
I wish you treated me the same way.
Since you're not willing to relocate to an actual jungle, I'm afraid King of the Co-op will just have to do.
What if Allen sautes my heart with diced liver and serves it glazed with a light cream sauce? Would that make you happy?
Its just that your pomposity wears us down
Sorry, Queen Tabby, you'll have to remove the cape in order to use that potty chair.
Stop taking my dirty talk literally.
Cat fights are serious. In our eyes, you won.
I know you don't want to hear this, but it's entirely possible that in your next life you'll be the mouse.
He not really a king. He just acts like one.
Maybe he'll act more royal as time goes on.
So Pussycat, Pussycat I guess you did more than just look at the Queen
I guess there are some jewels you just can't replace.
You shouldn't have given him that last daiquiri
Do you think we need to take away his catnip?
His weight has finally justified the royal plural.
OK we are totally listening to you. So how does it feel ruling the World ?
I'm not sold on the name The Donald.
He's discovered that the seat of power isn't an Easy Chair!
I forgot to turn of National Geographic when I left this morning
Do you think we're treating him too much like royalty?
He wants gold litter.
It's time for a dog.
We know. You ate the whole Whopper.
Yes, we do think you're royalty. But Rex and King are dogs' names.
How could you have put catnip on my favorite pillow?
I am going to ask you one more time, when do you last see the puppy?
I'm guessing he's been binge watching while we're out.
But cats don't have a President.
I have to admit we have a lot more fun now that he's dead.
We shouldn't have named him Rex.
Let's stop letting him watch cable news unsupervised.
I told you the cat has an attitude!
Shouldn't we run the family meetings?
'Honey, you have to tell him. He's not the king of the jungle.'
He's a little more benevolent now that he's older.
Despite this constant negative puss, catfefe.
You fixed me so I can't make an heir, so no children for you.
So you think that your king for a day?
I never thought I'd go along with this crazy taxidermy idea of yours, but it really does feel like Squeezles is still with us!
You may polish my crown and you may clean the royal box.
I still think that Rex is a dog's name
I don't care, this is not better than having kids.
Yes, but were going to empty your litter box anyway.
He thinks he's Donald Trump
But you went as a pirate last year!
Oh, Jared; I had no idea how hard it was to be king!
Your Majesty, your Royal Litter Box is ready.
Go get the court jester.
Did you remember to change his highness' chamber pot?
He just hasn't been the same since the mice democratized.
I say no more of that roasted swan with savory greens.
Phil, I think we need an intervention for Mr. Furry Pants.
Don't worry, Jingles, having to poop in a box doesn't make you any less of a king.
I don't like cats and now I know why.
It's time for the royal de-worming.
"And you want us to have kids"?
Kings roar - that was a meow. You're a CAT!
I told you not to give him so much Fancy Feast.
Can we ever be more than servants, Your Highness?
Cheer up, after The Orange One you'll reign again.
All he really wanted was a catnip mouse.
"I think we need to call Animal Planet"!
Pipe, bowl, fiddlers three and still a sense of ennui.
Your Highness, your royal kitty litter is ready.
Even the queen of England would lack dignity with this pose.
This "high and mighty" attitude has gone too far.
Your grace, please regale us of your laser pointer conquests once more.
Always remember...cats rule!
Now do you see we know our place?
Good job Mr. Muffins. The first step is to admit that you have a catnip addiction
I told you it was too much catnip.
After our home and the Internet videos, what challenges are left? Well, the Democrats still need a candidate.
And when we booked it, we didn't realize they had a strict 'no pets' policy.
Apparently he finds the litter box beneath him.
Wouldn't you like a little brother or sister?
Just because your subjects don't come when you summon them doesn't mean they don't respect you.
And to think we worried that our rescue cat would not adjust to our home
See? I told you Cat King Cole was the perfect name.
Maybe we shouldn't have mentioned neutering.
It happens every time he watches The Wizard of Oz .
Chasing mice was a royal pain.
Was the salmon too dry?
There's a queen out there somewhere who hasn't been spayed.
I think we should have had children.
It's your turn to clean the royal litter box
It started with the TV ads of the butler serving dinner to cats with white gloves and crystal.
Looks like Rex has been binge watching Game of Thrones again.
I believe it's time to bring out the house jester mouse.
Should we call you "your highness" or "your majesty"?
It's time someone told you, you have no clothes
The King went slumming and lost his gravitas.
I don't think she realizes the costume is a gag.
Bob and I think we may have taken this too far.
Your being put to sleep and we're getting a puppy.
Perhaps we should revisit our one-child plan.
And the gerbil could be his jester...
We've made a decision -- no more Game of Thrones till you lose weight.
How may we serve you, you Majesty?
I agree last year's 2 week vacation was selfish and deserved the gifts behind the couch and bed. I also hated those curtains. How about 1 week, double feedings and all new toys? Gil even read about a service that delivers three-legged mice!
Our prenup don't anticipate this
Do you really think he would accept us getting a dog?
I'm drawing a line at getting a mouse as a court jester.
Being king of the jungle isn't as easy as he thought!
And you think we're ready for kids?
I suppose you can still wear them, but the baby is going to change things.
And for the past 3 days, he has refused to use the litter box.
Mommy and Daddy would like your permission to procreate.
Being king of the house isn't quite like being king of the jungle is it.
Just because he has orange fur was no reason to name him "Donald".
But your Majesty, you banished all the mice.
Told you we shouldn't have named him Donald
He couldn't be king of the jungle, so this was the best alternative.
Now he wants to move into Trump Tower.
Let me see if I got this right......tuna on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and Kibbles every other day?
Is it just me, or has the nature of television changed?
It's 'King of Beasts,' not 'King of Fancy Feast.'
She just hasn't been herself since the final episode of Downton Abby.
Yes, I've noticed too. Ever since the dog died.......
Maybe just deluxe cat food is enough.
Tomato, tomahto, pepperoni, paparazzi, what's the difference?
I just had to have it. The artist called this piece "Fancy Fiested".
But if I get pregnant, think of the sibling rivalry.
This Taxidermy idea creeps me out, let's just bury our dear Elmer.
Where did we go wrong with Princess? Do you think it was the big comfy chair?
We turned you into a cat, but we don't know how to undo it. The best we can do is turn ourselves into mice.
Morris, this is not what "Cats rule" means...
You insisted he a it with us through the Game of Thrones binge - now he thinks brooding is cool.
It's a euphemism -- I swear. That's what he calls his litter box too.
He hasn't been the same since he saw his Family Tree online.
Okay, we allow one more episode of 'game of thrones'.
Dad, I know you are disappointed. But Prince Tabby is my ticket out of this hellhole.
Poor thing's lived in the exurbs too long.
I think we spoiled her too much
So, where's the frog?
We didn't mean to hurt you. We thought you'd understand it was just a nickname.
Why did you tell him we should cut the dog in half?
Well, we did name her Daenerys.
More catnip.
I liked it better when he disappeared to a smile...
youtube giveth, youtube taketh away
But Queenie, we just thought it would be a sweet name. We never dreamed it would cause a existential split between your dreams of self actualization and the realities of a world you can't actually control.
Sorry, but our money is on the Corgi.
I told you taking him to The Lion King was a bad idea.
We don't know who leaked the abdication rumor.
Catnip? Infused champagne? A fatted mouse?
So I told Prince Ramsay Bolton,” I am the Mad Cat-King! As ransom for my Life, , my Crown, and the IronThrone, I will trade you my two sad, TV-addicted humans,” and they agreed. Oh, here they are now! Good-bye, and thanks for all the fish.”
Sweetie,I know what you've been thinking lately but in this country we're still a meritocracy.
Let them eat hake?
I know it hurts but you cannot expect the dog to recognize you as sovereign.
I knew we should have stayed with dry food.
We let you decide about having a dog, but having a baby is different.
Let's call him Kim Jong-un.
King for a day; fool for a lifetime...
Three million likes on facebook does not really impress us your majesty.
There is no one left to fire Mr. President.
I think the Fancy Feast is going to his head.
You cousin, Leo, wants his outfit back.
The King of the Living Room missed his litter box again, do you want to pick it up this time or should I?
Ma'am, this speaks far more about you than your cat.
Prince ..Aptly named
No, Fluffy, I said it's RAINing cats and dogs!"
9 lives of this you say? Amen!
Somehow I thought training him to use the toilet would be more glamorous.
Can you at least give catnip a try?
Let them eat kibbled.
Don't feel bad! You're just different because you're a queen!
I didn't want to bring it up, but we need to address the litter box issue.
You're being silly, dear. I obviously love you more.
We should have gotten a dog!
Really, Percy, there are many health benefits in eating a vegan diet . . .
I guess we're watching Game of Thrones tonight?
I blame myself. I should never have switched from Purina Cat Chow to Fancy Feast.
When you act like this I almost regret ever naming you Louis Catorze.
I don't know; I still don't think he appreciates us.
Where do you remember wearing your boots last? Or It's time we faced up to the succession question Or Wouldst thou allow us to go away for the weekend?
Relax, everyone knows that you got more of the popular vote than the dog!
Makes me wonder how she spent her other eight lives.
We're sorry your highness, we're fresh out of Maine lobster.
Yes, Mr. Lion. You'll always be the king .
You can't just say, 'off with their heads' to the gophers outside.
Did you see this coming?
He believes he was Henry the Eighth in his first life.
He's more interested in bones than the throne.
Look Rex, we are very sorry but "après moi le déluge" does not apply to your litter box.
Yes, he's quite proud of his felineage.
He didn't know that mousing could be so complicated.
and we are DONE EMPTYING your CATBOX!
We realize this throne pales compared to all you do for us.
You're Fired!
You know the house rule...the one about reigning cats AND dogs. It's Fido's turn to be king of the yard.
he just received the miceacarta
He's just discovered they were fake mews.
We adore you, but hope you won't ever repeat that our place is a dump.
It's not all you were hoping for, is it,your grace?
I am sorry but we just can't afford fancy feast on our budget
Yes I will go shopping for you Puss. I think the chances of finding leather boots in you size is slim.
Don't take him on the White House tour again.
The animal psychologist said fluffy felt we did not treat him like the royalty he thought we should.
Think of it as a Tuesday and weekends kingdom.
The Fat Cats won.
The DNA test came back and confirmed what he always suspected.
Just because your DNA test shows a relation doesn't make you king of the jungle or anything else.
No Tiger, the lion is the King of the jungle.
I put all our assets in his name today.
Little Caesars again tonight?
Look at me when I'm talking to you
Is this a good time to talk to you about litter boxes?
This country has been good to me.
Your Majesty, rumors of mice playing while you were not on vacation are Fake News!
He's really let this YouTube celebrity go to his head.
But you are a eunuch.
He's like this with every boyfriend?!.
You had him before the marriage. He's all yours.
What makes you think that I would spoil our children?
Aren't you just the cats meow
He's mad at the Winter Garden Theatre.
Can you check his adoption papers?
...so I said to the king, I said, "Here's lookin' at you," and one thing led to another......
Look, Kevin, you won the Electoral College. You have to serve even if there are cats in the House.
Too much catnip?
You're a queen mother. I'm an adoptive mother.
They said at the shelter that his name is Donald.
We should block HBO.
Stop worrying. I told you: you don't have to be qualified anymore.
He's been watching too much "Game of Thrones"
First, the dog goes, and second, upgrade my litter box.
Let's call him 'the Donald.'
Since inheriting the throne, there's just no talking to him.
They want you to start as the assistant manager of the jungle.
She's been that way ever since 'da mooch' got 'da boot'.
Now he thinks he's a lion.
We know it's beneath you but, ....could you just TRY to catch a mouse??
I'm tired of the stupid "cat videos" roles. I want to give my viewers something of substance!
I'm sorry cat, but I think we have a new king.
When you took up taxidermy, I never thought we'd end up with this. . .
The vet says if we try to overthrow him he'll just develop a Napoleon complex
It's not the fact that you had Mr. Pickles stuffed that bothers me.
He thinks he's The King of Catatonia.
How was your vote supposed to solve our fat cat problem?
We understand, mousing isn't what it used to be.
After one episode of Game of Thrones he thinks he can rule the Seven Kingdom's
So it all started with a successful Cat Chow commercial and then he overheard a talent agent booking a revival of Imperial Margarine, so here we sit, waiting for that call ...
Could you please conquer our rat problem?
You tell him to use the litter box.
The popular vote is for losers.
I'm sorry but you're going to have to accept that you are definitely the end of your line.
Gee honey, maybe we should have adopted a dog.
Hey, this ain't fake news! This cat ain't got no clothes.
I fear that we moved him from the litter box to his new throne too early.
The stress is taking the fun out of it!
The regalia is fine but no golden litter box
I'm afraid our suspicions have been confirmed.
Your dooty to your people is done outside.
We've deported all dogs who don't speak feline. What's next?
First Trump now the cat, i'm confused.
Wait until you try to get him to use the litter box.
He caught a mouse today.
I warned you this could happen if we kept buying him that fancy cat food.
I think he wants his scepter.
Isn't he majestic? He's smarter than my boss.
Per your orders, the mice have all been beheaded.
OK then, so I take it this means that a child is out of the question?
Heavy is the head that wears the crown, King Mr. Paws.
He's taking over as head of our household.
Will Your Majesty be having any dry food tonight?
According to the chiropractor, if it doesn't correct itself in a week, to bring him back in a sedan chair.
The emperor has no clothes- where are the cat's pajamas?
It's nice to see a pussy in charge for a change.
Unfortunately, we're going to have to overthrow him nine times.
"Discipline was difficult, but he now knows his place." Submitted by Neil L. Sachs, Monmouth Junction, NJ
No, we're not putting the dog in the dungeon. Seriously Susan, it's time to stop giving Oscar catnip.
But the gold-plated litter box is going too far.
Those Sheba commercials have really gone to her head.
Reigns some. Eats some. Naps, mostly.
Are you kitten me?
We had no choice but to take away your boots...
He's discouraged by your disloyalty. Sad.
Think he knows he's not Trump
Mittens, your mother and I need to speak with you.
The vet said it's called "Trump Complex."
There's nukes flying through the air but the stock market is still up so I don't really know what to think.
He thinks he's king of the jungle.
... fire and fury like the world has never seen.
What's left? Changing his name to Henry IX?
The Vet said she was queening.
Sure the mice are playing, but that's not necessarily disrespectful.
He wants to abdicate for the pussy he loves.
Cuddles is playing 'Game of Thrones' again.
He thinks he's king, but look at how small his paws are.
Really? Did we not explain "uneasy is the head that wears the crown"!
You may have to abdicate if you don't leave the neighbor's dog alone.
She doesn't want us to have children.
...well how about 'chunky chicken?'
If only he knew that Fancy Feast is mostly ashes and sawdust.
None of the dogs at the shelter came with a crown.
I'm orange. I should be President.
But they were eight good lives.
Please tell us - where did we go wrong?
Whether it's Trump or 'Game of Thrones' doesn't really matter. No more TV for this guy."
You know, this is not what they mean by Lion King.
Perhaps we've taken the spoiling a little too far?
Mr. Whiskers,"How would you feel about a Parliamentary Constitutional Monarchy instead ?"
As you know, we have been your loyal staff for years. Could you reconsider us having Sundays off again?
I think he's sprawling because we're spoiling him.
Don't tell us, don't tell us. Pussy hunter, lazy king bit, and you go for tweets. You're doing Donald Trump!
Really, we've searched. We're out of mice.
Your throne has always been the litter box.
Sowwy, puddy tat, no mo' tweets tonight.
It's our fault you feel this way.
Those Ancestry DNA Results Really Went To His Head
Maybe that was just too many blackbirds.
Let's be realistic - you have no dinosaurs and winter is coming.
The message from Rome is no annulment.
The canine has agreed to relinquish the sun porch for the foot of the bed, plus a pound of catnip, your meowjesty.
The mice have returned, your majesty...with a vengeance."
He most definitely didn't win the popular vote.
How can I tell him his reign ends in less than nine months?
The critics said 'he brought nuances to the roll that Brynner completely missed.
You heiness, we believe the dog is planning A coo.
He tweeted that he wants to be called "The Donald"....
I promise you, the dog was banished.
Bring in the first peasant.
Don't worry, he's just a figurehead.
All I did was tell the taxidermist that we treated him like a king,not do this!
We should never have let him watch "The Lion King."
Nothing worse than a fat cat who thinks he's a king.
I told you we should've gotten his tax returns.
Foie gras doesn't care if you're King.
No, "Off with their Heads" doesn't count as catching mice.
Perhaps we need to renew his Twitter account.
The vet says you have gout.
It's not just that you aren't a king, it's kind of...you're a cat.
You have a real royal cattitude, don't you?
The mice just voted for independence.
We never should have named him Prince
I think we should switch her back to dry food
He hasn't been the same since we took down his Twitter account.
Maybe we shouldn't have named him Trumpie.
We don't have the technology to make your throne follow the square of light around the room.
Shall we scratch your belly now, Your Majesty?
Maybe we shouldn't have named him Donald
If we had known, we never would have had you spayed.
Apparantly, it's not a game to him...
I'm not sure what more we can do to show you we love you as much as Rex . . .
Now he really looks like a fat cat.
I can't wait to see the litter box.
We are sorry to have to tell you, we are going to have you spayed.
I asked him. he said ask you
All I know is she went to Bryn Mawr and thats all I need to know.
We're sorry, Your Majesty, but Whole Foods no longer carries fried mice.
Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Wriggles. As we said on the phone, we're looking for a short term loan.
Sometimes this is how I feel on the inside everyday all the time.
What's a Napoleon complex?
she is a king of queens.
I knew we shouldn't have watched Game of Thrones with the cat.
You Highness, we are tired of eating cake.
I guess you're right. The emperor really doesn't have any gonads
And, finally, I demand the cat door be made openable with my iPhone.
Off with whose head?
And here I thought Rex was a dog's name.
We did warn you that domestication provided challenges to your King of the Jungle run.
No, a catnip orb is out of the question.
If Queenie can have the car keys, why can't I?
Who needs boots to be the King!
Do you think we are encouraging her fantasy that she runs the household?
It's so hard to explain. At first I couldn't take him seriously – a stupid joke, I thought. Now this.
I don't know what happenned. They said I would be Purrfect, I guess will just have to wait for the next Game of Thrones call backs.
I hear dog owners have lives...
It's only for a day!
Only because it's your birthday... "Look at me! Look at me NOW! It is fun to have fun But you have to know how.”
Cats rule.
So what happened after you told the witch you could get away with grabbing whatever because you were the king of whatever?
Well, boys, cat got your tongues?
That's what we get for naming him Rex!
Not happy, King Donald? How about a gold litter box?
So we sat in the white house and did nothing at all and we did not like it not one little bit
You shouldn't have let him watch 'Game of Thrones.'
Sire, it's simply that 'Mr. Tiddles' just doesn't cut it when calling you to dinner.
Sire, the Grumpy Cat demographic still supports you.
Where exactly is Catatonia?
We should have never named her Cersei.
If only you hadn't called him "King of the Jungle".....
Who needs children when you've got a cat.
We can't afford caviar anymore.
I get why he's fat, but I question the royal lineage.
She's making us call her Daenerys Meowgaryan.
The New Yorker bet me I couldn't write a caption that was situation-agnostic.
So let's talk about your outstanding rent
He wants to move back to Trump Tower.
Naughty kitty, you get nine lives, not nine wives!
'Royal Consort' just wasn't enough for him.
I told you it would be boring if you beheaded the dog.
Okay, Max, you can join us for the Seder this year. BUT, save the gefilte fish for the guests.
...and then, as the smoke was clearing, he declared lordship over the entire neighborhood. It's been quite a busy day for Mr. Whiskers!
We just let him think he rules.
His Majesty appears bored.
We strongly advise you not to fire the bloodhound.
He says he was a king in his last life.
What do you mean you weren't able to compile a report of positive things people are saying about me?!
We need to have a talk Sir Scruffles.
When I said, "You're not a frog," the newt said, "It works with any amphibian," so I went ahead and kissed it.
Sorry, Sire, the can opener isn't part of your realm.
We respectfully request your Highness's approval of the name Duke for our new puppy.
I'm very disappointed in this cat.
He looks bored. We need to order more mice.
Ozy, we told you being 'King of Kings' would be hard work.
I read him the results from his DNA kit we ordered and now look at him!
Let's go back to dry cat food only.
Will no one rid me of this turbulent beast?
I told you Midtown Taxidermy might be a bit hoity-toity.
Now that he's got his throne, maybe he'll get down to doing business.
Your highness, where is your fire and fury?
And then for supper, we thought catnip salad, freshly caught wild salmon mousse with mouse feet garnish, and dessert of live crickets a la mode, your favorite?
Well, the shelter did tell us his name was King.
It said online the litter box guaranteed regularity through self-esteem.
But, Puss, dearest, while we've got an emperor running the country, there's no room for a king.
We tried to tell you something like this would happen
Earlier, he said, "Paint me like one of your autocrats."
The White House put him up for adoption since they have room for only one king.
Yes, we know... Brexit was far more complex than any of your people realized.
He just doesn't seem as comfortable since we put in the extra-firm lumbar support.
We think you'd be a really great king, sweetie, we really do, but you need to start thinking about more realistic career paths.
May we suggest that your Trump impersonation has begun to cloy?
The global cat video economy has gone to your head, Scruffy.
Oh Sparkles ... the new baby won't change a thing around here!
The crown and robe was his idea.
We just want to try some dry food....for a few days...your majesty
Oh so humbly, thy does beseech thou, to lay off that damned catnip.
I told you not to give the cat free rein.
Go ahead, you tell him that’s not what “raining cats and dogs” means.
Like husband, like cat.
Well I guess we got roles mixed up!
I knew we shouldn't have left those self-help tapes playing every day to keep him company!
The catnip is here, may we commence with bellie rubs now, your highness?
Your father and I were thinking of getting a puppy, but we wanted to get your OK first.
We just wanted you to know what an honor it is to serve on your cabinet.
We know trump would love your impersonation.
You have to let it go
You're supposed to be the king of the jungle, not the condo.
Look what a kitty coronation does to you
Sic semper tyrannis
Who knew Game of Thrones would end this way?
Has he been binge-watching Game of Thones again?
You are...your a very regal pussy. Your just suffering from monarchy malaise.
But the tuna casserole was for the kids party...
"We know you are the cat's meow but do you have to be so loud.
Cat: "When you fight, expect to be scratched"
Heavy is the head that wears the cat crown.
Let's Rethink this Organic Catnip Thing.
But I'm sure you could have won if you were wearing your new clothes.
Yes, but she's a benevolent despot.
I don't mind him thinking he's royalty, but his taxes are killing us.
Maybe we shouldn't have named him Henry.
Is our Queenie kitten us?
At least we know how Spot got his three-pointed jester's hat.
We're canceling your Amazon account ... and your credit cards.
Be patient, dear subjects, while I decide which of you will be in charge of the Royal Pantry and feeding me and which will be filling, cleaning, and replacing in a timely manner the Royal Litter Box.
Just because your name is Trump.......
He insists on being called a 'phat cat' from now on.
We have to shut down your Twitter account.
Listen carefully. You are a cat. You are not the king of the castle.
We understand that you think this place is a dump, but we can't go to Meow-a-Lago every week-end.
I feel sure he is not disinterested in us. At a minimum he feels loathing and contempt.
She leans left and doesn't tweet. She's got my vote in 2020.
When in the course of human events, Max dear . . .
He's been this way ever since they discovered the Russian connection.
Did you eat all of your subjects?
The Lion King isn't all that it's cracked up to be huh?
More nip, Your Grace?

Now he's ordering the children to man the ramparts.
I think we can build a better mouse trap.
I doubt that he knows that he's getting neutered today.
This is all because you bought the scented litter box

"He's been listening to 'The Feline King' again."'
As your loyal subjects, we humbly request that you place your royal treasure in the litter box at least once a fortnight.
When you said your pussy was royalty this is not what I had in mind.
But, your excellency, we can't cut little Jimmy in half!
First life a juggler, second life a cowboy, and now this.
It needs to be more 'Christmas-y'.
" "In retrospect, we should have had her cremated.
Maybe it would help if you asked the Royal Physician to cut back on the cat-a-tonic dosage?
Okay, if you say Spike can't be trusted to guard the house when we're away then he needs to go.
The success of his internet meme has really gone to his head.
We'll call you His Royal Highness if you eat the generic cat food Paul bought.
I couldn't toilet train him, but for some reason, he took to this right away.
We said 'don't chase the Pooch!'"
I never should have told him about the email server
I don't see a collar.
We bought a crown, a cape, and a throne, what more can we do to make her happy?
Quit smiling. You'll just encourage him.
Toonces contemplates the "nine lives" strategic advantage in winning the Iron Throne.
Sorry, Rex. Those animal-rights activists won't let us bake live blackbirds.
Fluffy, this is our first catnip intervention.
No, your highness, we are not licking your backside for you.
It's my fault, I left the"Game of Thones" DVD running.....
And so, Your Majesty, consent to our divorce would mean Ma'am will have two palaces.
We'll call him SCOTUS - Supreme Cat of the United States
His royal highness needs his deworming medication now.
The emperor torn up his new clothes
Children? I don't think we are ready for cats.
What do you mean, you finished your bucket list, and you still feel unfulfilled?
You kiss him, no you kiss him
The lyrics to Stuck in the Middle With You finally made sense to Mittens, "Clowns to the left of me, Jokers to the Right, here I am".
We got your results back from ancestory dna test, and, well, let's just say it's good that your sitting down for this...
He says he's an enchanted prince and only tuna fish 3 times daily will transform him back.
You still only get Nine Lives
The " mouse job" doesn't come with a Title The " mouse job" doesn't come with a Title.
Your show is on, but you must honor your scheduled apearance at the animal shelter.
Cat Lord still sounds better than Cat Lady.
Don't worry about my cat. He's really just a figurehead.
I told you we should have bought the puppy.
He's sad because he lost his boots and the lifts inside them that made him 2" taller.
He's disappointed it's not the Iron Throne.
You may pet the tummy now.
I told you we shouldn't have named him "Trump."
Seriously, you changed your name to Aristocat?
He likes being an "only" cat!
You may pay tribute to her Majesty with a formal chin scratch.
Oh he's actually pretty low maintenance
We never should have allowed him to watch HBO.
Whatcha doing?
I know we agreed on taxidermy, but did you have to go this far?
The pet store won't sell us any more canaries.
Cheer up, Max; nine months is a long time.
I don't think he feels heard.
Cheer up. Being a Cat with a Crown is much better than being The Cat in the Hat.
The vet calls it a Purrsonality Disorder
Anything more?
You know that you're concerns are our concerns.
Just because Trump was elected President of the country does not mean that you can become King of the house.
Has #Caturday gotten out of hand?
Game of Thrones has really gone to his head!!
That genealogy search has really gone to his head.
He's never scratched or clawed for anything.
I've found I just don't need a man in my life,
"Maybe the saying 'It's good to be the king!' only works for Mel Brooks?
Well ,Im telling the truth my seventh life i was ELVIS,now get me a peanut butter and banana sandwich,Priscilla.
Honey, I think you are spoiling him
Yep. The acid just kicked in because I'm seeing a cat on a throne.
we need to discuss your recent amazon purr-chaise submitted by Ahme Bowen, Minneapolis, MN via my account
I'm sorry you're not ready yet, but it is time to pass the crown on to Charles.
The good news is that the dog is Prime Minister.
He eats, lives, and shits better than we do.
You do not need to abdicate just because we're getting a kitten.
Next time, let's get the dog.
The litter box, people! I mean it! I really don't want to walk in there. Who's turn is it?
Everyone still has to use the litter box.
Oliver, we're taking away your Fancy Feast.
Of course we can assure you, we are your handmaidens 24/7.
You could try licking yourself.
Even her hairballs glitter.
King Snugglefluff's reign of torpor.
It is time you allowed Charles to assume the throne.
We should have gotten a mixed breed.
Heavy is the head that wears the meown.
Your excellency, we need to talk about your cat-titude ...
He's very proud of his hunting skills.
You're really a commoner
Ok, so NOW will you tell us where you hid all the pens?
Go get him his catatonic.
Cat got your tongue?
He so depressed that Game Of Thrones is only 7 episodes this season.
It is the biggest blessing of my life to serve your agenda."
Shall I fill the royal crunchy bowl or will you?
Your majesty, the mice are on strike.
Sweetheart, we named you King George ironically.
Now, to find a Foolish Mouse.
Well, then where is the last place you remember seeing the canary?
So how long were you Trump's house cat?
Can you tell me the hardest part of being king?
We've known for a long time, but where did you get the trappings?
I told you the premium cat food would go to his head.
We've been over this before. You were named after Costello, not Presley.
Look- mice, bugs, whatever can be your subjects. No more cats.
I told you "King" is a dog's name, never a cat's.
Is this house an unworthy kingdom?
not again... look what the cat dragged in
Honey, I think we need to talk about our cat food budget
We're sorry, but we thought you knew - Siam is no longer a country.
Ya think he heard the new kitten talk last night?
He thinks he's our dog.
I just thought I'd make it explicit.
Okay, we got you the chair but you're taking this too far.
This ain't goiong to end soon. He has 9 lives.
It's called irritable bowel syndrome.
Yes, I think the power has gone to his head, Dan, but at least he can't use Twitter.
Sorry Rex, nine lives still applies to you!
Nobody knew being king could be so complicated
What he's requesting, sire, is to move the litter box off of his pillow and back to the kitchen.
Would you like another mouse, your majesty?
She ate her kittens, and now she has an heir ball.
There's never a day off from being king!
I'm all out of arguments...your turn.
Heavy is the head, eh?
I thought King's Taxidermy was just the guy's name.
Your salmon Benedict is in your bowl with a side of sparkling water, the television is switched to the animal channel, and the dog is in his kennel; can we please go out with our friends now?
We submitted to all your requests, now eat your damn food!
I wonder if they suspect me of eating the pet rat.
Just admit it. We've suspected this the whole time.
He's auditioning for the role of Louis XIV in "A Tale of Two Kitties."
Cat's in the Cradle.
Okay, but you still have to use the box.
Your flagrant disregard for the litter box makes you the dirty rascal.
This cartoon idea I had in college did not age well.
We're getting a dog and you can have all the catnip you want.
I'm sure he'll be pleased with us if we just try a little harder.
I'll be her lady-in-waiting if you'll do butler and chef duties.
...you just don't have to flaunt it in our faces.
Would Your Majesty prefer salmon or duck?
Stupid pet tricks: "catatonic state"
This IS an intervention! You are a cat, not a King and we are not your loyal subjects!
By 'we,' do you mean 'the royal we?'
He feels we owe him since we had him neutered.
It's like, ever since we got HBO, he doesn't like the same games.
Just consider us as a provisional government calling for free and fair elections.
If we're lucky, maybe he will "abdiCAT".
I say belly rub, he insists under the chin. Who wins?
And when you’re a star…you can do anything…pussy…you can do anything.
We...may have taken this too far.
This Phat Cat routine is getting a bit old.
Revolt? I don't know, we'd have to behead him eight more times.
What, you thought being King for a Day meant you weren't getting neutered?
I heard you correctly, sire; I'm just not sure you have any room left for the third blind mouse.
OK, she said it was her...not you. Who knows how Himalayans think, anyway?
When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. But then you get eight more lives.
The elephant was needed in another room.
Another mouse beheaded?!
The therapist says he's down about killing all his relatives to reach the top.
I understand you wish you had unlimited power but you know…Magna Catta.
F king cat
We don't care what happened at camp!
We closed your Twitter account.
I agree. PETA's regulations have gone a bit too far.
Deserving or not, he's found his niche.
Looks like the tuna kibbles did him in!
Your Majesty, would it be possible for us to watch something on TV tonight, other than Animal Planet?
I warned you this would happen if you let him follow Donald Trump on twitter.
Well, that's capitalism for you.
I see, so it’s going to be “l’etat c’est meow” from now on.
Mommy and Daddy just want what’s best for you, Your Highness.
He misses Spicy and The Mooch.
Luck of birth, I guess.
We are putting you on a low-carb diet immediately after your coronation celebration.
Only 7 lives left to shape up, Your Majesty.
When, in the Course of human events ...
I don’t know, should we take her to the vet or to a shrink?
King Leo says you're blocking his sunlight.
Joffrey over here hasn't seen season four yet
Have you checked the canary cage?
Got into the catnip again!
Must it always be the death penalty?
The vet says he is just another fat cat
We think you're taking our little joke way too seriously now , Tiddles ...
Stop worrying so much. There are only a few mice on the Grand Jury.
What are you looking at? Don't you know a cat nap?
A lame King in need of a strong Queen, it seems to me.
Looks like our little King had one nip too many.
You brought him home and named him Donald.
Now, he'd like us to do a video of you playing with a large ball of string.
Prince Philip says he won't press charges if you give his things back. The queen is not happy. The old man you frightened down the stairs in London is Philip.
.... and he claims to have a copy of your birth certificate from a hospital in Kenya...
What did the vet mean by 'royal ennui?'
I used his scepter to scoop the litter.
We've considered 'King of All Things Feline', but we're sticking with 'Kitty'.
Sorry, we just can't afford pet insurance.
Lately I've noticed a lot of fake mews.
Uh, there is such a thing as being too cool of a cat!
Fetch me some nip, peasants!
Is this what we paid a king's ransom for?
I remember a simpler time, when cats could just be cats.
I think he'll be disappointed when he realizes what we meant by 'kitty litter'.
It's daddy turn to wear the crown.
We need you to understand that your best years are behind you. You are not going to get another cat food commercial.
Where are we going to find a scepter at this time of night?
Maybe the Trump cat shelter was a mistake?
Oh no, Game of Thrones must be back on!
we saw the Lion King last night
He's practicing the power of meow.
He does rest uneasily on his throne, doesn't he.
Don't go all Hamlet on us, but your distant cousin is still king.
All he does is eat, sleep, and stare out the window. It's good to be the king.
The fat cat in a hat sat pat while answering queries rat-a-tat-tat
Even the one percenters have to hear "NO" once in awhile.
I wish he was a more enlightened monarch.
Finally the TRUTH! Our cat rules................
Bill, Your cat is NOT tired of governing. HE has ED Issues!
Sweetie, when he talked about "grabbing", he didn't me you personally...
I think he is going to want a castle next.
He just got fired from the White House
But neither of us wants to take on a second job.
Actually, it's the Year of the Rooster.
Don't mistake my silence for weakness.
That's not always the case, Oliver. The Emperor Wears No Clothes was not just a fairy-tale.
I found him on Pennsylvania Ave., but his collar says Wall Street.
Ted, as taxidermists go, you’re a bit too literal.
He's even beginning to LOOK like Donald Trump
He'll only watch "Game of Thrones"
He got rid of our dog in 10 days and wants us to make kibble great again.
If we spay her, who's next in line?
You want our purrsonal loyalty...? Well... I guess so...
When exactly does your "incredible prize" go home?
You knew when you accepted the throne that you'd have to stop chasing certain things.
I guess what they say is true. This really is the golden age of taxidermy.
I still think we should have gotten the rug
he always ruled the house antway
Cheer up - the Dog Days of Summer will soon be gone.
I thought he was one of YOUR friends.
They warned us he had trumpism tendencies.
Can we talk boundaries?
Do you want to watch the version from Animal Planet or Netflix?
We've given you what you wanted. Now will you clean your own litter box?
Yes, your food comes out of cans but they're nice cans with nice food.
Really, Rex, catch your own damn mice.
Now that we've sent the kids off to camp, what is your will, Sire?
Do you think we spoil him?
He's demanding to see Rasputin.
Yes, if you just apply yourself and work hard, you can become King of the Jungle.
AND - scene!
I'm not Steve Bannon. I'm not trying to suck my own cock.
We can't send him back to the Rescue Shelter like this.
He says we have to stop calling him 'Mittens' and address him as 'King Tommen Cat Barathmeow' from now on.
Sometimes it all feels like I'm just chasing my own tail here.
Do you know who ate the Parliament of Fowls?
I guess cats have always been post-irony
Think he'll keep us on his staff?
How about some ermine pants? Is that what you want?
Taxidermy suits him.
Maybe children would have been a better option...
And later he said we're gonna Fancy Feast like kings.
I think King Fluffy Bottom VIII would strongly benefit from a less purr-missive parenting style.
He's a very good vet, maybe you should consider abdication.
Listen, if you really, really don't want to write the LCAT, you don't have to.
His latest video failed to go viral and now he wants to abdicat.
Apparently we didn't meet his needs with the ball of yarn.
He doesn't believe me when I tell him hair balls were not covered under Obama care.
I'm sorry, we just can't afford the 24K gold scratching post.
Would your Majesty like to greet John Snow, or have her tummy rubbed?
We're downsizing.
You'd think he needs more lithium?
All that Tweeting is killing me..
I can somehow understand that he's disappointed - we should have bought the full set, including orb and sceptre!
Windows 10 is just fine.
Cheer Up, There are things you always wanted to do if were deposed.
She doesn't seem to appreciate the irony.
He's having a feline fantasy brought on by catnip. It's called "delusion of grandeur".
But Sire, beheading the puppy is illegal.
Are you sure about abdicating?
I know you're royalty, but you still get only nine lives.
let's address the cat in the room
Could you grant us this one favor?
I fear he's suffering from ennui.
Him getting rid of our dogs is a bit much!
I thought you ordered a scratching post.
We're here to assist you at your every beck and meow, your majesty.
Its our turn to sleep.
Shall we ask to change the channel?
At the time, we were thinking more of the furniture than of the line of succession.
Looks like someone's proud about that mouse he caught.
Yes, heavy is the he'd that wears the crown but you requested it.
Does "Does Blue Apron have a cat diet?
It's his tribute to his cousin, the King of the Jungle
E'etat ce'est moi.
I still think changing the carpet is the only way to get out the pee smell.
I told you we needed a DNA sample.
I'm sure the President didn't mean it personally.
Never underestimate the power of the Pussy
I understand hairballs are now to be considered holy relics.
I hope we're now clear who's boss.
I knew feeding him caviar every day would come back to haunt us.
My nip please. Too much heavy governing.
Perhaps Your Majesty should have eaten a smaller Corgi.
We never should have named her Queenie.
Forget cash, cat is king.
Will there be anything else, Your Majesty, before we retire for the evening?
You knew what you were getting into when we got a cat.
That last episode of 'Games of Thrones' did it.
We should get a dog.
Use your words!
I'm sorry, your majesty, you still have to use the litter box.
Idid't know it would be so complicated.
You just had to name him Richard the Purred.
Time for me to be re-purr-pussed.
Obviously, the Whoppers were not a good idea.
Let's put him back on the dry food.
Tracing your ancestry back to a lion does not make you king of the beasts.
We're getting a kitten, so you will have to abdicate the throne.
Your most recent CAT scan showed a slight aberration.
Yeah, who knew healthcare was so complicated.
I don't care if you're the royal cat. You cannot "haz cheezburger"
You know, all cats have their litter cleaned up after them. You're letting it go to your head.
Best of show does it ever time.
Catnip will always be our state food!!!
But if we take our house back from him we will see will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen!
We didn't rescue you to give us attitude...
Well, Cole, Mike has told me so much about you. Glad we've finally met. I assume you're an indoor cat.
What'd you expect? You're the one who wanted to name him Donald.
Sometimes I just want to grab him.
Should we bow or meow?
Tybalt was only teasing you, honey. You're king in our hearts.
Ever since he met the Queen he hasn't been the same.
He wants access to Twitter.
And we thought Trump was bad...
What do you expect in one day?
Shall we name him Donald?
No sir, we don't know why you've called this meeting.
"Sir Richard" was not a wise choice.
Donald Trump wishes he could grab this...cat
Bring me my phone. I feel a tweet coming on.
Get over it. Puss 'N Boots you're not.
Yes, uneasy lies the head that wears a crown, but you're a cat.
It's a jungle out there, isn't it?
Did you have to steal the queen's things to prove your visit?
"Now there is the truest form of an aloof monarchy"!
No, Your Majesty, building a wall to keep out next door's Chihuahua is simply a pipe dream.
We need to talk about your "throne,"aka, the litter box.
I don't care what his tweets say, YOU are the greatest fat cat there ever was.
Perhaps we should have just had it removed.
Sorry sire, turned all the mice were here illegally and had to be deported.
Cats rule.
I told you not to buy a cat from Trump Tower!
Jim, you have just been so annoying ever since ancestry.com told you that you're 1/16th Egyptian.
We lied. Your distant cousin is still king.
To think I gave up my nine lives in Trump Tower for this!
Do you prefer warmed milk or bottle water?
Hmmm....let them eat catnip
I guess I just thought once I hit my teenage years I would rule the house...
We never should have named him 'Tut'.
Alexa just can't understand him.
Third day, positive again on the pregnancy test.
He always gets this way when he watches The Wizard of Oz
Maybe if we got rid of the mice footmen and made her walk more it might help .
Your majesty,did the Little Friskies meet with your approval ?
I thought this would be all it would take to make Tulip happy.
There is no need to be so upset over spilt milk your grace.
All we're saying is you might want to cool it with the tweets.
Your throne does need swords...
Do you think Rex's name has gone to his head?
A couple of snips and you'll become the metrosexual everyone wants at their party.
You know we try our best, Rex, but Fancy Feast simply doesn't make grilled venison and pheasant morsels in gravy.
He plans to unite the litter boxes under one rule
And then I TV him the Cheshire Cat sequence.
But I'm concerned he may not be comfortable.
Should we send for the blackbird pie?
I have disconnected all mice from computers.
Let's call him 'King Feral'.
Yes, we consider you a prince, but you gotta go on sale diet, Charles.
It kind of looks like this cartoon we're in was drawn by a cat.
Don't think of it as a diet, it's more an extension of your realm adjustment.
Oh, Brad, I'll so miss you after the beheading.
Giving him Fancy Feast has been a catastrophe.
He wants a fried peanut butter and mouse sandwich.
I call it the Trump effect
and which one of us is The Fool?
Ain't I the cat's meow
Obviously, the Whoppers were not a good idea.
Not one single mouse consumed, but an entire cheesecake…so much for 'noblesse oblige'.
When they told me, "Cats Rule, I had no idea."
You want your toes sucked?
He was happier as "The Prince."
We realize we may have spoiled you a bit, your Highness, but we’re not buying you an Iron Throne and you’re going to have to lick your own fur.
Unfortunately we're all out of Trader Joe's snacks, and they're closed until tomorrow.
Wikipedia refused to list his autobiography.
King Whiskers, I did advise you to not stay out late drinking milk last night. You've missed your morning tweet.
I knew we shouldn't have read her all those nursery rhymes.
I think it's time he abdicated.
From now on let's call him KING Fuzzy-Wuzzums.
We could call him KittyTrump.
He's watched too many Disney movies.
Here, Kitty IV, Kitty IV, Kitty IV....here, Kitty IV....
Your father and I have been thinking. Perhaps it's time to choose a wife, a Persian or maybe an acceptable Burmese of good breeding.
The dog refuses to play court jester.
Is our desire to win this photo contest really the only thing we have left in common?
I told you naming him Joffrey would go to his head.
Now that I have been crowned King, what's left?
So Elton is a dog person, you still know how beautiful you are.
Meet the king of the bungalow.
The seared ahi was slightly under-cooked, but you ate way too much.
They said you were acting like a despot.
Your Majesty, there is something we need to tell you.
He thinks he's King of Purr-sia.
What happened to the merry old soul?
Yes, I was okay with you taking Tootles to be preserved. But seriously, the Trump theme is totally creeping me out.
I think it's time for the talk
The vet says it's a form of feline psychosis. Our Dexter believes he is Henry VI in a state of cat-atonia.
He just heard the Duke of Edinburgh was retiring. He's depressed.
Maybe we should have scratched him equally on both sides.
Rescue cat - from "thrown out" to "in throne".
We know you're having second thoughts about leaving the EU, but you cannot go on like this
Face it, Fluffy. You're no Simba.
Everything is going to be okay Mr. Friskypants. This is 2017... They have pills for that kinda stuff.
So, how do you like the new litter box?
What should we do? He's creating his own kingdom and it's ruling us!
He's overdosed on Games of Thrones.
Bored? Again?
What's the matter? King got your tongue?
We just think, Your Majesty, that maybe you ought to get off your throne now and then and chase a mouse or something, is all.
The entitlement cuts were purely budgetary, nothing personal.
Who's going to tell the emperor he has no clothes?
Shakespeare meets Andrew Lloyd Webber? I'd buy tickets.
Shouldn't have bought him the cape and crown; now he thinks he's the cat's meow.
The thing I like the least about having him is being his loyal subject
I think he needs a horse.
It's not easy barking out orders all day long.
Your majesty, might we be granted leave for a weekend in Lake George? Or, if it's your preference, a week in Kathmandu
Morris, we're sorry but we're not going to carry you over to the kitty litter box anymore.
Well, it does keep him from scratching the sofa.
The pet psychologist said it would be a good idea if the cat was not in the room while we watched Game of Thrones.
I see the emperor has no clothes.
You know, he’s just the head of state, not the head of government.
Okay, we'll try to find you an iron throne.
Have you yet read his tweet this morning?
The shelter warned us he has a tendency to be aloof.
We believe he has nine distinct personalities.
His name's Tybalt.
They say the best leaders are those who never wanted to lead.
But even we don't get to eat foie gras every day
Great taxidermy, but it takes up a lot of floor space.
But not all emperors are expected to have clothes.
Which of us will have the honor of changing your Majesty's litter?
Here's the proof my WORDS WITH FRIENDS moniker of "Crazy Cat Lady" is true.
It's almost time for your Fancy Feast
That's what you get for putting royal jelly in the cat food.
Mr Tiggles, when we said you ruled us, we didn't mean it literally.
Too much kitty porn would be my guess.
Are thee not restful of thy laser pointer?
We must disagree, your Majesty. Despite being king, yours does stink
We promise to smooth your transition to our benign dictatorship with a higher level tuna treats.
But your grace, it was the freshest tuna in all the seven seas and freshest litter in the seven kingdoms.
who said he was spoiled
So it's settled. We guillotine the dog at noon.
Mommy's Kittykins IS king of all he surveys - all 220 square feet, until his fat ass can jump up to the windowsill.
The good news is that your hunting privileges have not been revoked.
Ok, it looks like jousting at 1pm and PETA International at 4pm.
Really? You never knew that a King Charles was a type of dog?
frgnnn
The Fancy Feast is going to his head.
I'm bored...
Oh yes, your meow-jesty.
We know you're peeved at the jester, but you need to wear full COURT dress.
Methinks that Fluffy has been watching the HBO again.
We never should have named him 'Tut'.
So you really are the King of the Cats!
We may have taken the 'child substitute' thing too far.
It’s been coming our way for several generations
Takes one to grab one.
So you want the wet food, but warmed?
Well, I'd say 2020 is in the bag.
Think he's happy now?
I don't know how to tell you, but I'm pregnant.
So, where's the bird?
He's still upset that you bought the store brand.
I'll cook his dinner but I will NOT kiss his ring.
Despite your claim of starting a dynasty, we're still getting you fixed tomorrow.
The queen told me she won't leave the house until her pawdicure is complete.
YouTube sent him it after his latest video topped 100 million views.
Is this what you call "Felis Envy"?
Which one of you wants to be The Hand?
You really need to let Egypt go.
I suppose this is O.K., but you two could try a little harder.
He called for his bowl.
An aphorism waiting to happen if I've ever seen one
Now, about your Declaration of War against Companionship, we have some concerns…
You think we've spoiled him?
That's why we named her Princess.
It's the King of Pussy, Donald Trump.
But, the other staff member agrees with me that we be allowed to sit with you in the livingroom.
We wish you could relax and play a bit more. It seems the weight of your crown is getting to you.
I should have been a cat.
I told you it would be spoiling him to switch to the wet food.
Hum, must belong to Trump!
The old dutch clock told me so and that is how I came to know.
Jungle, schmungle...you'll always be #1 around here, Lester.
Let's go for the adoption litter plan.
You go catch the mouse this time. I got it last time.
What a day...used up eight of my lives!
I think reality set in once we let her outside by herself
I'm sure when you read our resumes, you'll find our feline references are impeccable.
Encouraging him run for president was a big mistake!
Trying to keep up with Queen Elizabeth's drinking, were we?
Harold, King Puss here, has somehow made us his vassals...
I'm sorry mittens but we just can't afford full time palm branch wavers right now.
As long as you wear the crown we will refer to you as Your Meowjesty
You're right... This all started last November.
I told you not to get him pajamas.
Sure we love you, but we can't afford feeding you caviar any more.
I think he's gotten a little full of himself.
He has no memory of being a rescue cat!
We should've just bought Broadway tickets...
The primary was exhausting.
I know It's purple, but I still think she should apply to Harvard.
So, this crowning achievement of yours…do we all need to take a little stroll out into the alley?
Just deal with it, we're building self-esteem.
It's look at ...not look like.
No way! This time I'll be the jester and YOU'LL be the food taster!
Cats were revered as Gods by the Egyptians. They've not forgotten this.
Frank, I don't care if you spent a lot of time on the outfit. It's not funny!
Those fat cats in Congress gave me an idea.
I'm telling you, these casting directors for the Lion King are total xenophobes.
Well, Frank, it's clear to me she just doesn't want to be down at our level.
How else may we serve you my Lord?
In my humble opinion, Your Majesty, "King of Debt" isn't a derogatory title at all.
It's not your fault you cannot produce an heir.
Come on honey, all the other princes are joining Little League.
I don't care that he was your mother's cat, and the heir to her entire estate....he's not going to rule my life too!
A Mrs Lovett offered to take her off our hands.
Poor pussy's feeling a little down in the Trumps right now.
Well, nice try, but he still thinks it's his litterbox.
I don't care how much she ignores me, I will not 'bend the knee.'
He grew up in Queens in a very wealthy litter.
In about 9 months, you are going to be a big brother.
Some bullshit about the Upper East Side.
I know he's a pimp cat who's stoned out of his mind but what other choice for 2020 democratic presidential nominee do we have?
I still feel guilty we had him neutered.
It has to be the Fancy Feast. We need to get him back on Friskies.
I'm sorry, you cannot declare by royal proclamation that this is now the House of Rusty.
We thank you for the opportunity and the blessing to serve your agenda.
He says he'll abdicate for a mouse.
It appears the emperor has no claws.
We know you like the crown, but it's just too heavy.
That is one fat fat cat!
How did you know I was pregnant?
Maybe we should get a dog
I don't mind the crown or the throne, but I am really getting tired of hearing you say "Off with his head!" whenever you see a mouse.
Listen Henry, the shelter assured us you came with nine lives, not six wives.
Let's embellish her crown with our savings.
I must admit, after 7 years of watching the series and reading and re-reading the books, I had NO idea you, Fluffy, were to sit on the Iron Throne.
Monarchy is an outdated social construct. Let's kill him and divvy up his assets.
Because of his Orange fur he thinks he's King of the World.
The litter box is out,he finds them discussing and embarrassing
What else was he going to spend his YouTube money on?
He is not amused.
He brought it in last night.
Sorry to tell you this, but it's the last season of Game of Thrones.
Well, okay, maybe a LITTLE.
Would you like to move your royal ass, once in a while?
Maybe it's time to get a dog.
Let them eat Gorgonzola.
We still love you even if daddy can only scratch your head every other weekend.
Talk about the dog days of summer.
Wait till you try the pizzaratsi
John, it's your turn to taste-test the King's supper.
Uneasy - and outside - lies the head that wears a crown.
Your approval rating is fifty percent.
We can't keep indulging him anymore; I think it's time for an intervention.
Heavy is the head that wears the meown.
He actually wanted a cardboard box.
Uneasy lies the head, eh kitty?
Being treated like a king is exhausting.
Trumpy Cat
It will go viral, I promise. Just keep the crown on.
She's been this was since the CATS revival closed
Honey, did you give Queenie an extra cocktail last night?
he does realize he's still at the shelter, right....?
All we are saying is, maybe this is a midlife crisis.
" He stopped responding to " Here Kitty, Kitty".
If he can't be king of the jungle, he can at least be king of the living room
He'll fit right in with the Washington crowd.
But we are completely loyal to you.
Giving you the master-suite was supposed to be temporary.
Maybe we could have something different for dinner tonight?
Don't listen to that silly dog - you are still the king of the household.
We just don't think the solid gold cat box is gong to work for all of us.
The vet says to look at real life for your models of behavior, not cable news.
Hey- we were both grieving...taxidermy seemed like a good idea.
The new season of Game of Thrones.
I think it's time to cancel his Amazon Prime account. His consumption patterns are out of control.
Knew we shouldn't have named him 'Trump'
The shelter also said he was used to getting his way!
Why do you think they call it a catapult?
You're not going to invoke the divine right of kings now, are you?
you're a little bit too obsessed with the Game of Thrones
You do remember, your Highness, when you were King of the Streets and not OUR Castle?
No, you may think you are royalty, but we are definitely not getting you a Twitter account.
Sir Whiskers, we are bringing home a kitten; therefore, your subjects request you abdicate the throne...
Is this what they call illusions of grandeur.
That's it, no more cable news in the background.
He seems to think Trump is still President.
Really, you'll like the new dog!
Well, you named him Reggie,
Your cousin may be 'King of the Jungle' but this is ridiculous.
Explain to me again how this makes him an emotional support animal?
Well you can be the king of our jungle gym.
When you said he was a fat cat from Washington, I was thinking of someone else.
Looks like it's sushi again tonight.
You're the one who named him 'King'!
I told you he would adapt to a multiple-cat household.
He's disappointed that he isn't loved for his greed.
So do we call a vet or an alchemist?
We just want to help
Maybe a Tomcat would have been easier after all.
All is not lost: remember that on the internet, you're a god!
Since his operation, he wants to be the mouse queen in the Nutcracker.
I think he knows what happened to the dog.
Still, naming him 'Rex' would be simpler.
Joffrey, we think you're taking this Ruler of the Seven Kingdoms a bit too far.
Honey, I think the cat has been watching too much Game of Thrones.
Buck up, Alex, there are more Internet sites for you to conquer.
Permission requested to speak to her majesty.
Our King of the Mouse
He's clearly your inferior, King Puddles, but Mama's other pussy needs some love.
Do you think we treat the cat well enough?
This is hell. I wish they'd just stay at college during the summer.
Beulah, peel me a grape.
Its time to renovate the litter box
Can't we watch something besides Cat Channel?
Someone grab me that pussy.
Oh, these two? American purebreds! Exeptionally well-groomed but a bit uncooperative.
Metaphorically speaking you no longer wear the pants in this family.
"Obviously it was the Trump Beauty Contest".
We get it. You were a big cat on Animal Planet - but you're a ruler meow, and you need to act like it.
Time to cut this "King of the Beasts" kibble ration.
She always knew it was that way, now it is confirmed.
Dogs have masters, cats have staff.
If we let you sleep on the bed?
All this after just two votes.
We're just tired of being treated like dogs.
Soft kitty, warm kitty
We are not putting rose petals in your litter box.
Prince Puss is just a nickname. We thought you knew.
Pussycat, pussycat, where have you been?
I miss Mr. Rogers, too, but...
Trump fatigue?
It's alright Marmalade, there's always 2020.
O.K., but we can't afford fancy custom-leather boots in your size.
"You will still be ruler, but we're getting a dog".
Now, Mr. Meow, you must have known that when we said you could 'sit on the Iron Throne,' that we weren't being literal!
Your majesty, the peasants are not happy, you have been deposed by a puppy.
I'm sorry, but Trump doesn't want any pets in the White House.
You'll still be the king. You just won't be able to have any royal offspring.
This isn't what I meant by Royal treatment
"In another life he was Henry VIII".
It's hard to call you, "Your Excellency" when we keep finding hair balls in our bed
And maybe you could stop scratching up the curtains? Sort of a noblesse oblige?
House Fatpussy was not a threat to the Seven Kingdoms.
Would you like a little kitten to play with?
It's been such a hectic reign.
His Majesty has decreed no purrs until we give him Fancy Feast twice a day.
No, we're not going to take Jimmy to the gallows. We're sorry he stepped on your tail, but he's our son and we love him too.
But, you've always used the litter box.
We just had a couple of ideas about dinner that we hoped you might consider.
He thinks he's a lion.
Who knew you could knit?
At least he lets us feed him.
It's tough being the king of beasts when you are only a pussy cat!
We went to a protest. She lost a bet. Don't ask.
This wasn't what I had in mind for my penultimate life.
We warned you. Heavy lies the cat that wears the crown.
Yes, king is better than President. Yes it is. Yes it is.
It's his take on King Lear and Cat in s Hat.
No, really. No jungle. No king. Just a liter box and the back yard.
Tabby is suffering from his delusions again!
It all happened after Trump made a speech about cats being superior to dogs.
Winning the mouse eating contest may not have been worth it
Do you think we could trim his nails now?
Look Mr. Winkles, for the last time, you are forbidden to watch HBO ever again.We just got over the vampire thing.
The 'royal we' wish you would stop pussyfooting around and buy the damn sectional."
We think you need a 'cattitude' adjustment.
So, what DO you do all day as king?
She is not amused, Dad.
He prefers Empurrer Sniffles now.
Steve, you let King rule our lives when he was alive, and now he's gone.... well THIS is where I draw the line!
You can't just wear your Halloween costume every day.
He won, but he wasn't popular with the colonies.
They don't allow cats in the White House so we're house sitting for you until he gets back.
I hate to break it to you, but King Felix pitches for the Mariners.
President Trump doesn't understand the true meaning of 'Fat Cat'.
Carry me in my litter box and I will regale you with gems!
It's good to be king.
Being a mascot is clearly your passion and you are so, so good at it. But there just isn't a scholarship offered at any of the schools we visited.
We're very sorry, Reginald, we just can't get you a horse."
I told you I'd pay you a percentage in royalties. But since my cat ate my checkbook, I'm making an indirect deposit.
" I hate the way he lords it over us. Where did we go wrong?" ?
Bring me a Dog!
We really did think that "Cat Fur Cape" meant it was made FOR cats...
We've put the pussy on a pedestal.
OUR DEMICAT WANTS TO BE KING !
Well, you may be king out there. But I'm telling you: It's not a jungle in here.
Maybe we pushed him too hard
Listen, Puss! You knew your boots were history as soon as King Donald got his tiny paws on them!
Being that you're already orange, the tweet said the cape and crown would make you happy.
It's good to be queen.
I told you all that wet food would spoil him.
So sorry but that's your uncle Leo.
I told you he was getting too big for his britches.
No! I didn't mean put this kind of reign on Roscoe's behavior.
Rescued from the Royal Acatemy. "Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them."
His majesty commands you to fetch the newspaper.
Sic transit gloria mundi.
Really, he didn't mean it-- "fat cat" is just an expression.
The vet says to cut down on the wet food.
I feel his sovereignty may be dwindling since the last banquet.
Well, he finally got around to naming himself "king"...... maybe we should name him The Donald......?
Well, we can at least be pleased that the mouse population has diminished.
Smarten up. Cats have the edge. Always had the edge.
Shall I prepare his litter?
I am leaving you.
He binged seasons 3 through 6 of GOT
The palace job is too big. He wants to abdiCat..
Was it that spaying thing, m'lady?
Winning the Milk Chugger Royal Crown sounds great, we get that, but look at what it's done to you. You're lactose intolerant for goodness sake!
I told you, we just should have named him 'Fluffy.'
It's only your 8th life, you still have one more coming.
Who knew, all those years the vet said he needed to lose weight, that the taxidermist would make it happen.
He says, who knew a ban on visitors from canine-majority neighborhoods could be so complicated? He thought being King would be easier.
Lately it seems you've been getting delusions of grandeur.
Rex 'omnia' doesn't mean EAT everything. More like 'moderation in ALL things".
DSH or not, we are yours forever!
We think you have put on the right attitude......now let's work on gaining WEALTH!
We'll help you find your boots.
Leos don't suffer as much as we think. They ascend the throne and wait for conditions to improve.
Funny how they think they are in charge of a home.
I told you not to get him a fancy litter box.
Permission to speak, your Highness?
I think you and Fluffy Purratheon need to stop binge-watching Game of Thrones
I hope his first born is female.
We should never have let him consolidate power.
Tiger, of House Thompson, first of his name.
Your Majesty, the vet is here to lop the Royal Balls off.
I think he's suffering from dillusions of lionhood.
The Emperor Has No Clothes is just a story.
We know leadership is hard. But catering to your needs makes us feel like we are realizing our full potential.
Would you consider at least disavowing the rats, if they can't be eliminated?
She looks pregnant how can we afford to dress the offspring?
'The King & I"? I don't know. Seems like a stretch.
No, it's not just how cats are.
Your majesty, as your most trusted and loyal advisor, I have to tell you that the Exchequer of the Royal Kitchen has replaced your favored brand of cat food with a less expensive one…
He had 2 million hits on you tube now he thinks who the heck he is.
Where did you hide the remote, son?
He's promising to make the animal world great again.
I don't care if your great-aunt bequeathed HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS to you, we're in no position to entertain royalty.
I warned you that naming him Rex Mundi would be a mistake.
Jealous! Do you want to see my claws?
This happens every time he watches the Wizard of Oz.
I wanted a King Charles Spaniel!
Crown or no crown, he's no longer a standup cat.
His Majesty is just practising alcohol
She is overdoing the "Fat Cat Syndrome".
Is he dead yet?
He's taking "Cat King" a little too seriously.
Does buckwheat want a belly rub?
Maybe the crown'a a little too much?
According the shelter he studied at RADA.
He evidently feels everything is just purrfect.
That’s the king’s way.
Well, Doctor, I can't put my finger on it, but since his last role in 'Pets3' he seems to have some sort of superiority complex....
Sure, you're the queen of the house, but you still have to use the cat box.
He was just king for a day.
OK, you can scratch the furniture if you want, but you can't go to the White House.
So . . . your new title is Purrfection?
What a predicament!
I told you we shouldn't have called her Catrine of Aragon.
Alas, the Co-Op board rejected your catnip garden.
I knew it was a mistake to call him Trump.
We named you King because we liked the name, not to honor you as royalty.
Next time I think I'd prefer a dog.
I call him King Katz.
Honey, now that it's legal it's stronger. You must adjust your dose.
We should probably stop buying him Fancy Feast.
He must be thinking about running for political office.
I guess his bird-chasing days are over.
I feel like we just don't communicate the way we did before feudalism.
Tiger-ball, have you been hanging around Mercutio again?
Yes, of course the crowd at your coronation was the biggest ever.
Donald the Lionheart
I wasted time, and now doth time waste me.
We thank you for the opportunity and the blessing to serve your agenda.
Well . . . I did happen to mention to the taxidermist that you always hated Arthur because he thought he was the King of your castle.
Weary lies the head that wears the crown, eh?
We need to cut him off from watching CNN.
We should have never let him watch Lion King.
Can't we teach him to golf at least?
Once he saw that documentary on lions, he insisted on being named "King of the Condo."
We're lucky he lets us serve him.
...another thing, the cat food is terrible!
I could never get the dog to wear the crown.
It’s not that our feelings for you have changed. It’s that we wonder if things have gotten a little…asymmetric.
Seriously Mooch. What did you think would happen when you called the genie a Royal F**** Pussy?
"Let Them Eat Rubberbands" has effectively scared the cats, Your Highness, but the dogs are simply confused.
He's been so finicky ever since he has his heirs beheaded.
He says what we've heard is true - 'Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown.'
Better slow down on that new catnip.
The decision came down to performance, we will be using sticky traps going forward.
"Puppies or kittens?'
He's upset because you won't call him Joffrey.
The speech was going great-- until I spat up a hairball.
It's not what you thought it would be, is it?
We would have cleaned the litterbox even without the royal decree...
We should never have named you Mufasa!
I say throw the bum out--he leaked all over our white house.
I believe your dad and I attributed properties to you that you don't really possess.
Aie confiance, Pousse Pousse. L'Etat c'est toi
We thought you'd like a throne, instead of a litter box.
What makes him think we are back in feudal times?
I told you the canned food would spoil him.
He hasn't been the same since you mentioned abdication.
If we really play 'Game of Thrones,' does the Atskay know what's umingskay?
I'm sorry. The proverb says you can look at a king, not be one.
The judge says we each get half.
Allow me to present Sprinkles Rex, Lord of House 2272 North Sunset Lane and Warden of North Cherry Avenue.
So, you wanted a dog?
You'll think you were king to if I fed, clean up and stroke your head everyday!
But adding diamonds to the litter box is where we draw the line.
'"Harold, if you did put something in her bowl, you need to tell me."
Sorry, the new kitty is not one of your subjects
It's either me or Instagram, Harold.
Maybe it is time to think about having an actual child of our own.
morris the remorse
We were wondering if it might be possible to take the next weekend off.
A jewel-encrusted gold litter box might be taking things too far.
Sire, due to economic uncertainty in the kingdom, we are afraid that going forward, our feasts will have to be much less fancy.
I knew we shouldn't have named him Cole.
I think we're ready to compete with friends and neighbors pets.
He looks like he's drunk with power!
Sorry, you simply can't eat any more of our children.
Next time, less CataTonic.
That's just the lions, Mr. Sparkle.
We're well past the dry food versus wet food discussion.
I refuse to sing "God save the Queen" !
But you weren't bored lazing about before you were crowned.
Tell me how long you have felt this way.
She came with the house. The previous owners were big 'Game of Thrones' fans.
Well, I simply chose the least qualified member of this household to lead us
So I guess we will need a King size bed
But really - the Pied Piper is just a story.
I told you that new cat food was too good for him.
...well, we told you not to contact ancestry.com.
Everyone's dead. The throne is yours. Now what?
I told to keep him away from anything that tweets.
We really ought to stop lionizing Tiger.
Honey, I told you this would be a (cat)astrophy.
I've decided to abdicate for the tabby next door.
OMG, it looks like she is growing a 5th leg!
We want you to be comfortable but not *too* comfortable.
Comfy?
Just because your name is Donald doesn't entitle you to act like this.
Hard, being king feline rat killer at Trump Tower.
I told you he's to drunk to be a king
Prince Phillip knows exactly how you feel.
He's been like this ever since the Red Wedding episode.
Honey, ask your brother, Kermit; it's not easy being queen.
That's why they call it a rat RACE.
I think he'd prefer an iron throne.
He let that cat show win go to his head.
King of the Jungle!?!? This is Park Slope.
John and Sasha's social clout had taken a serious turn since the kids had got past the 'cute' stage. Drastic action was needed.
It's not that your birth mom didn't love you, she just wanted you to have better opportunities.
'He thought the Deluxe kit came with a sceptre.'
He's been like this ever since he chased that mouse away.
Cattitude
So, the new kibble met your expectations?
How may we serve you, King Kitty Cat?
I'm sorry, but pregnancy test was positive.
We're sorry King Kitty but the power of your pur-suasion has dissipated, and this cathletic thing is no longer working for us.
The pheasantry is stewing, sure.
Who knew tuna was this complicated?
He refuses to leave his throne for the litter box; elimination is tantamount to abdication.
Not born with a silver spoon, just a silver litter box.
In actuality, he has really small hands, tweets like a bird, and isn’t grabby in the slightest.
We need to talk..
He's a Trumpish Rex
And such tiny paws, no wonder we named him after him.
We should not have told him about his pedigree.
You cannot go out, it is not a sanctuary city
Your robe is 100% lion's mane.
I was sure it was "AT a king," not "LIKE a king," but I guess you were right.
Feline comes from the Latin 'felonious.'
So, now that you're comfortable, the vet says you've got cancer.
Maybe we are spoiling him too much.
Well, he does have a distant cousin who is king of the jungle.
I can't take this anymore...
I don't know if this extermination service is worth it.
He really needs the Blue Royal Scepter.
I drew the largest audience ever, period! Hmmmm...needed ketchup
Well, you did name him 'Rex', dear.
I see your book if finally paying royalties.
Trust me. He is not coming for you.
One day he started bragging about grabbing pussy, and it was downhill from there.
I think he misses his scratch pole.
Think of it as getting a baby brother.
This restaurant has the most amazing pepperoni paparazzi pizza!
I don’t care what it says on Wikipedia, Cleopatra is just a name
And you had me spayed?
The shedding stopped, but it still looks insecure.
Don't look at me. I didn't take his scepter.
No, you tell him!
DT- you don't look so good...
Cats have nine lives and this one parties hard because he knows it.
Between us, that grumpy cat has more followers.
This is what happens when you give him the HBO Go password
So I quests we're watching Game of Thrones
Yes, it IS good to be Cat, but a bit exhausting, yes?
The king wants a bigger throne. And more food.
I'll let you know when I'm ready to go out.
We have to talk. It's about the moat.
Here’s the thing, when we named you King Meow Meow, we didn’t think you would take the honorific title to heart.
We were thinking about going out later; would your majesty okayeth?
And now he wants an en suite.
We told you that twitter account was a bad idea.
You think we made a mistake when we named him King?
I think we've said that we're "cat people" one too many times
A lot of our favorite people die on GOT. We all have to deal with it.
Sure, we could have named you Simba, but I liked Sylvester for reasons I won't get into.
I said, 'You're feeding him too much of that expensive brand...' You said, 'Come on, we can indulge our kitty a bit!' I said,"....!"
We're thinking of getting a dog.
you can't expect your tweets to solve every problem.
The paunch that launched a thousand scat chips.
Fido's agreed to relinquish the sun porch for the foot of the bed, plus a pound of catnip.
He hasn't said a meow in 2 days.
If there's no jungle here, is he still the king?
I didn't know this is how you and mom feel about me living at home.
Couldn't we have had him creamated like most people do ?
Should we call him Gluttonous the First of the Letmicerun Dynasty.
She thinks she rules the house.
The majestic king of the living room.
We sure hope that "First Cat" appointment works out for you!
I think the success of his YouTube channel has gone to his head.
Let the dog eat cake
He overheard our call to the dog rescue.
The dogs are angry and massing at the front yard.
Oh King Cat-man-do, meowousiful sovereign, how may we serve you?
QUICK, RUB HIS BELLY WHILE HE'S SLEEPING.....
No, I'm pretty sure the expression is 'Cash is King.'
I know Baxter, but Halloween is over now.
I told you not to mention "his rump".
Do you think we should have made him do chores?
Honey, you got to tell him...this show has closed !
Don't fret Puss, Zappos guaranteed delivery tomorrow.
Honey, do you think we're spoiling the kitty?
Because 120 million views
Of course he's depressed, he just saw the revival of The Merry Wives of Windsor.
I think the power went to his head.
A mouse, a mouse, my kingdom for a mouse!
You are tired of mice?
We have to go away for the weekend.
I think we should cut back on the royal kibbles.
I really don't think we spoil him any more than other house cats.
We beg a favor, Sire.
He even thinks purring is beneath him.
Tell me again, which one of his nine lives is this?
I think he misunderstood what you meant by "teaching a cat to sit in the throne".
It's the Napoleon complex. Hopeless!
I'm sorry. When we took you in,we thought you were a feral cat, not a pharaoh cat.
Ennui is perfectly normal at this stage of the game.
I am not convinced Charles Darwin was right....
see? I told you we should have gotton a dog.
I think all those YouTube views have gone to your head.
it is with a profound sense of patriotism and respect for your office, sir, that I report that we're going to put you down because you won't stop pissing
Do you think he's happy?
"frightened a little mouse under her chair" doesn't cut it mister. What did you really do there?
No more Garfield.
Noo, Lassie is NOT coming home.
Maybe you'd have more friends if you dropped the Royalty Cat crap?
Regardless of your lineage......you're still going to the vet to get neutered.
The vet said the next time he bit me to crown him.
No, no, you kiss him first.
You feel you need more staff?
Alright, so Scratch Daddy was a really poor name choice.
So, the audition was for the R-A-T King… And he got it
Now, PLEASE tell us where you left the remote control!
But my one and only life is spent pampering him.
Heavy meows the head...
Removing the string from the stone must have been exhausting.
We warned you that being king would not be a walk in the park.
I can't believe we chose you over a puppy three years ago.
Sire, we sorely regret the Ahi tuna was not up to the usual standard.
You expected something different?
Don't get used to it, Misty; Jack Bailey's coming back tomorrow.
Naming her "Daenerys, Mother of Kittens" may not be my only problem.
Her Majesty's subjects hit 3 million and counting on Youtube.
Well in all fairness Game of Thrones is a really good show.
...is it just me or has his entitlement enslaved us?
I was expecting a different 'Lion King'.
King Tweety needs a cat nap.
So no more ottoman, huh?
Your swish is my command.
It's unlikely that mice cause gout, but the vet wants to be extra cautious.
Where did this crazy Twitter account idea come from?
We've overdone the 'cat lover' thing?
Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown that has no twitter followers.
How let's get the dog stuffed.
I told you Trump University was a mistake.
Sire, the people demand to know who's an adorable fuzzy-wuzzy little monarch. Sooner or later you must issue a proclamation that you are, yes you are, yes yes yes.
Sire, keeping order with Claw Enforcement has to stop.
Do you think he's a bit too entitled?
I thought all we really wanted was a mouser.
I think maybe you've given her a complex.
Who knew that Trump Fever was an interspecies contagion.
...but what happened to your shoes?
Do you really think Donald will try to grab this?
I told you we shouldn't have names him Tybalt.
No,No, not "My kingdom for catnip" again!
Her Majesty's litter is ready.
When he went Paleo I didn't think he'd ONLY eat foie gras and lobster
You're The King of Mew York?
Now it's going to get really bad; the few you left will undoubtedly increase their reproductive rate.
She has been impossible to live with since her video become #1
I’m wondering if adopting a cat named “ennui” was a good idea
Couple is forced to wrestle with "Spoiled Only Cat Syndrome"
Why so glum,Tom? That thing was ruling you.
'Look, just because you have an ancestor that was king of the jungle....'
I'm worried his crown isn't big enough!
You know what they say -- uneasy lies the cat that wears a crown.
He prefers the term beneficent autocat.
- we're really sorry, but we just haven't got room for "horses and men"
An edict concerning the mice in the kitchen isn't quite the action we were hoping for.
All those leaks by the mice are really getting to you, aren't they, Your Highness?
We'd better check on the dog.
Despite what you feel, this is not a monarchy.
I guess canned cat food is not an option tonight.
I think we need to cut back on those "Wizard of Oz" re-runs.
And even if you are royalty, cat food stays the same.
When you named him Henry, what did you expect?
Sorry, Leo. The concrete jungle doesn't count.
I still say you should plump for 'Muffy the First'. . .
I told you it was a bad idea to name him "Trump".
For your own good, we've decided to implement a news black out.
No, it's a cat-ass-trophy.
Henry IV was a terrible choice.
Maybe I *am* spending a little too much on premium cat food.
He wants to move to the White House with The Donald.
He started wearing the crown after eating a Monarch butterfly.
The Emperor Has No Spine.
I told you we shouldn't have named her Princess.
I want a divorce.
ANOTHER ONE?!! (And you thought you had office problems)
"Well, you did name him Louie Catorze".
He deserves so much better.
Nobody knew how hard it is to be king.
Enough Game of Thrones for the Cat
Are we playing king of the jungle again?
I think obedience school is out of the question.
I warned you about the power of the...
You just seem, well, uneasy.
Honey, it's never too late to overthrow the cat.
I realize we do his bidding but isn't this going a bit far?
We need to catnip this in the bud
Well,Your Highness,did you save room for dessert?
He came with the apartment
Honey, your Mother & I are concerned about your social life.
Despite it, she still licks her own crotch.
I told you to take it easy on the Fancy Feast
Meow down!
He has never been the same since he dragged home that ermine he thought was a rat.
This is starting to feel like a kleptocracy.
Do you now understand why I advised against taking him to "Richard III"?
OK--Here's the plan. Wet Food for breakfast and dinner, dry food for lunch. Undisturbed nap times at my discretion and access to all beds. Lastly, if I can't have real mice to play with don't bother with toys.
It's about time you learned, there's more than one ruler in the animal kingdom.
It's okay, you're still the cat's meow.
The diagnosis was Royal Malaise.
This is not how you go about changing your name, Chester.
Perhaps castration will de-regalize your highness.
No, but you'll always have our honesty.
He needs some mice to torture.
You knew that I was in a relationship when we started dating.
I've come to a decision: Cut me in two, and you shall each have half
Rub my belly you peasant!
You know I've always been a cat person but you're making me have my doubts.
The producer said I took his idea of a fat cat too literally.
Oh no, Majesty! Dieting would not demean your splendid royal image!
"All that Fancy Feast is going to his head".
They call me the Master of Whiskers.
His family line is king of some jungle.
The hairball toupees just might pay our mortgage!
Honey, you'd think he would show his royal subjects at least a little attention.
He thinks he's related to the King of the Jungle.
Auditioning for The Wizard of Oz?
Every reign comes to an end, it's time for you to go outside.
Should we grab him?
The TRUE "feline complex"
Well, not exactly; upgrading the litterbox is not on the list of items that we need to discuss.
He doesn't want tuna anymore, only caviar.
King of the jungle, NOT the living room!
Royalty never means to get between commoners.
Cheer up Rollie, your base adores you.
I wish we had gotten a dog...
I think that video we posted of him went to his head.
In my 9th life I'de like to be a King Charles Spaniel
And we're going to call her "Princess"...
It's alright, Henry. You're the king of OUR jungle.
one mouse , haven't you taken this far enough Felix
I'm allergic to monarchs.
You didn't really say that our house was a "real dump" did you?
Actually, it reveals your cosmopolitan bias to a shocking degree.
Not sure where he's been. Gone for three weeks and now all he can say is the ogre is giving him irritable bowels.
Your Highness you're only Feline. You can't blamed yourself for not forseeing the coral reef destruction.
So, Fancy Feast for dinner tonight sire?
Honestly, if it keeps him from scratching the door, Flotsam can act the king in here all he likes.
Did you order Papperoni or Papperozzi?
Steak or lobster?
Miss US Pussy Pageant contestant levels complaint of grabbing by pageant organizer.
Chipmunks can't genuflect, dear.
Food or nap sir?
Let the mice eat cake.
This catnip kingpin really changed you, man.
If one more person submits "It's good being the king" I'll barf on your Keds.
Our cat rules.
We need a hobby.
It's a man's home is his castle, not a cat's home; and it's just a figure of speech.
It is absolutely not because you are self-obsessed, vapid, and meow lies. The media is simply biased against orange cats.
Would you like to try being queen for a day?
Would you like your saucer of milk now, Your Meowness, or after your nap?
Impeach her? But I constitute her political base.
Queeny we don't know how to tell you but our new apartment is in a pet free building.
Almost there. Now he just needs a chain of office. Ruby or Emerald?
I'm feline like the title has gone to his head.
He's taken his royalty to a whole new level.
You just can't cat around all night and then act entitled all day.
Donald is one fat cat
It all began when I started cleaning out the cat box every day.
The president grabs him once and he thinks he's royalty...
The royal belly rubber
Heavy is the head that wears the crown, eh, Mr. Sprinkles?
We're just asking that you consider the possibility of abdication.
So Rexy, Mommy and Daddy got you some nice fresh sashimi for your dinner tonight.
It is a dog-eat-dog world out there!
Uneasy lies the slouch that wears the crown!
Millennial moggie catches mouse.
What happened to Rex the Wonder Dog?
Cat as trophy
He definitely looks catatonic to me.
He still seems unhappy. What more should we do?
It's your turn to clean the litter box.
He's calling for his Fiddlers Three.
We don't mind cleaning the litter box, but we will not "bend the knee before thee."
Let them eat kibbled.
Playing King of the Jungle can be exhausting work.
Naming him Ivan the Terrible isn't helping with US - Russian relations.
Gold fleck kitty litter. Is that really a thing?
What we are saying is that we can serve on bended knee in spirit but not in practice.
It started with eating at the table, but now I don't think it is a stage anymore.
He says in a past life he was a lion.
We're not going to address you as your highness.
If Best in Show isn't enough, have you considered politics?
Do you think he needs anything?
I'm thinking some family therapy......
Don't worry your Highness, when we return from dinner your leftovers won't be in a doggie bag.
We should have known better, your grace.
I think the kittens look exactly like you.
We sense attitude.
It's the new King od Catalonia
I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
This isn't going to get you out of a bath, your majesty.
Non. Le chat, c'esr toi.
Now is the winter of our discatent.
I didn't know Trump had a cat.
King's own horses and men can't even put him back together again.
Sweetie, this has to stop. We're not buying you the play castle with moat and you don't have the divine right to eat the dog's food.
Fat cats these days, acting like they're royalty!
When we said you wore no clothes we meant it literally, not figuratively.
I told you not to name him Herod and how does he know I'm pregnant?
Carl, we really need to discuss these feelings of grandiosity.
She seems to get the Queen for a Day bit.
Yes, you are a puppet.
It appears that she drank more than her 4 alcoholic beverage for the day.
What do you mean "we're fired"!?
he's suffering from lese majeste
I'm done with the rat race. I've changed careers.
Being King Of The Beasts isn't what it used to be.
Maybe we could try pampering him a little.
Oh-nay ore-may oyal-ray eevee-tay eries-say.
She says the dog abdicated for the French poodle down the street.
Your father and I are getting divorced.
EdiePus, How were you to know that she was your mom.
He says he caught a mouse in the backyard which entitles him to be king.
I know the therapist said we should treat him like royalty, but he's still no match for the Nutcracker's Mouse King.
Now Fluffy, don't you remember how it was at the shelter?
King Snarlemagne and his trusted advisors.
At least we have our priorities right.
He thinks he's Trump
Someone get them a dog.
This started when POTUS told men to grab others' cats.
So what's the line of succession?
He was the unexpected winner in the other 2016 election, for the King of Beasts, and now finds he is overwhelmed.
But you said you like it when I take risks.
We never should have let her sleep on the bed
He's been like this since the Miceacarta was signed
Is my little Cat King cold?
You want us to do what with the dog?
I think she likes the pirate costume better.
The vet said because she is blind, it's all about the material.
No boots, no video.
You do realize that this is a dream, right?
We are so grateful we get to care for you. Really.
We should have never given him the Royal Canin.
I know you don't like him, but he'll win you over with his treachery
Heavy is the head that protects you from that laser pointer.
You need to stop watching the Wizard of Oz!"
I think it's pyjamas time.
You're Fired!
He says he wants to abdicate.
He says he's leaving us for the Trump Administration. We're not yuuuge enough.
Do not despair your highness, your latest roar received great ratings!
I knew we shouldn't have named him Joffrey.
I think there were too many blackbirds in that pie
Too much CNN....
Next time please verify the cat show has trophies for all participants.
I can only imagine what we'll have to do with the litter box next.
So tell me again about that Mark Twain story.
The store called it the Trump accessory package.
he's been diposed since the House of Great Dane moved in
We overdid the royal treatment.
Try not to worry, kitty Putin also had set backs.
At least he doesn't have access to the nuclear code.
Remember, son, uneasy lies the cat that wears a crown.
Your Meow-ness, we have a mouse problem and are asking for your assistance.
It's time to talk 401K
Your Majesty, how does mouse fricasee with catnip dressing sound?
But what would He have us do?
I didn't think he would take game of thrones that seriously ......
Poor thing...was sitting in front of the tv when they reran that part about the President grabbing pussy.
Of course he's depressed...the youtube video never went viral.
---whereas, in a constitutional monarchy, a monarch does not have absolute power, but rather, is a ceremonial leader. You see?
Honey, I warned you not to name him Louis XIV.
Gender reveal party? We don't even know who the prince is.
I really think we'd be great parents.
It's hard to tell what's a command and what's an offhand remark.
Uneasy lies the head that loses Sir Squeaky Mouse.
The taxidermist really let his imagination run wild with our little Harry.
The common folk refuse to clean your gilded litter box.
Hand over the mouse, Elvis. Daddy wants to watch football.
Well, I give up. He still refuses to use his litterbox.
We'd like to talk to you about mouse guillotines.
Please stop calling us your subjects. It's demeaning.
The Imperial Margarine went to his waist and his crown.
Looks like curiosity almost killed him.
Your Majesty, when our guests arrive, please remove the crown.
Your majesty, the kingdom's vet, who is terrific, says you are in perfect shape.
You see Dr. Perez, Boots looks up to our President and it-- it worries me.
Yes we miss Snuffles too. So you remember how warm and snuggly her fur was, well......
NOW do you wish we had kids?
I just don't know where her attitude comes from.
And now you wonder why little prince fluffy thighs has an attitude of entitlement.
whose the pussy now?
We promise, will be back the very next day.
The mice refuse to pay for the exterminator.
She ate the mouse she caught and she now acts like the king of beasts.
Would you like us to bring you more cups to knock over?
Yes, we know you like it but you have to let other kitties have a turn at renting it
It's not what it looks like-- I have a crown, too.
Maybe we should slow it down with the game of thrones marathon
Well, I saw a mouse this morning so this didn't work.
He thinks he's the King of the Siamese.
Honey, where's the dog?
He's bummed out that 'The Lion King' isn't available on Netflix.
He voted Remain.
He's been this way ever since I told him his hair and his belly made him look just like Donald Trump.
Yes, I like him much better than our son as well.
Why resist? This is reality.
Well; no one to blame We voted for him!
Do you really want me to chose between the two of you?
Her majesty has requested that we only serve her swordfish for the next month.
I was binge-watching "The Crown" and it started about episode six.
I gathered his subjects last time.
The St. Crispin's Day soliloquy was really, very tiring!
I don't think we should have played the "Lion King" CD so much.
I asked you to gather here to tell you both how much I hate this cat.
Who would have thought that Donald trump would have finally been reincarnated as a cat?
Yeah, but then I remember Trump and ... honestly, I don't regret wishing on that cursed monkey's paw at all.
Yesterday he was dressed like Caesar!
We shouldn't have named him Donald
But why would you want a horse?
Staff, stand by!
I never SAID the fur on the cloak was ermine.
Where are the cat's pajamas?
I told you not to feed him margarine!
So we wanted to talk to you about fluffy going to doggie heaven.
The Vet says he's suffering from delusions of grandeur.
The White House made us an offer on your crown and robe that we can't refuse.
Darling, there's something we've been trying to find a way to tell you: we love you, and this shouldn't change anything...but you're adopted.
It's hell being the first cat. They expect so much of you.
When he's exhausted chasing ermine, he consoles himself wearing it.
How would you feel if you were now Felix the Ninth?
Hey, I loved Henry first.
He used to live at 725 5th Avenue.
It all started when we gave him the Throne.
These Fancy Feasts are getting out of hand
It may be time to bring back the TV.
Turns out, an heir can't ascend until after my ninth life.
We think this is taking Fat Cat just a bit too far.
Should we send hime to college? Done that!
Now that the cats out of the bag, Susan we need to talk.
it is with a profound sense of patriotism and respect for your office, sir, that I report that we're going to put you down because you won't stop pissing and shitting
It's your turn to play the jester.
May we lay on you yet, your majesty?
Please may we leave you to go to Gramma's funeral..?
Methinks Falstaff has hit the sack again.
And you say he ate the entire rat king?
He's way beyond the cat's meow.
Do you think the catdom will survive ?
O.K. king for the day is over.back to the urban jungle for you dude.
For my pregnancy you bought me a moo-moo.
Another mouse, your majesty?
We need fitting Tweets.
Meow.
he thinks he's Burt Lahr.
Ancestry.com traced my lineage back to Cleopatra's cat, "Pussums".
Guess the vet got confused between neutered and spayed.
Yeah, I guess I do kinda spoil him.
If you have something to tell me, say it quickly.
And we *still* don't have health insurance.
I KNOW she wanted to play queen-for-the-day, but I think the 21 mice were a little much
I'm not calling him King Meowy the First.
I would have never left my first husband if I knew he'd turn out like this.
Yes, you're right. This throne is not acceptable. We'll get on it right away, and please accept our most sincere apologies.
Leo roars the loudest because he attended jungle camp.
It's not enough.
We never should have named him "Mr Trumpy"
Gold dust in your litter box is just too Trumpian.
I think she's been watching too much GOT
I guess we need to be supportive of our thespian cat who identifies as King George after seeing Broadway's Hamilton. Awesome. Wow.
Don't you think you're taking this part Cavalier King Charles Spaniel a little too far?
The taxidermist thought this was a more fitting pose for Henry.
His name is Presley, Elvis Presley.
I think the whole Game of Thrones thing has made his King of the Jungle gene kick in.
We're sorry, son, but you're just gonna have to wait to be king.
Too late! His attitude with the mice was 'Let Them Eat the Cake.'
If your feast isn't fancy enough, please let us know.
You know, your ancestors are probably turning in their graves.
How do you think Fido will react?
Today's edict will be forthcoming. You may assume it will begin with a snack.
He just tweeted that we're litter lumps.
Son, this is an intervention.
Damn, I just had the most profound and original realization. Like, we own our pets, right? But, like, maybe it's the pets who really own us?
Okay, we'll make the youtube video, but you can't direct it.
He said we could stay if we stop buying him grocery store Caviar.
Telling him he was Royal Siamese was a mistake.
You'll always be the king in our jungle!
Can you imagine if we'd named him Garfield?
Can you add a kitty litter to the shopping list?
I never thought I'd have to fight dragons!
Sixty years, twelve presidents, and now tweets!
For the last time: your name is Mr. Jeffrey not Joffrey.
It's the last item on his Nine Lives List.
Shall I scratch your tummy?
He just got off the phone with Trump.
Please,spare,Daddy. I'll never let him give you dry food again.
Does he get a second date, Your Majesty?
See, Mr. President, you got your wish!
Do you think a sceptre would be an appropriate cat toy for him?
...and for dessert he wants mouse mousse.
The time has come for you to move out. Your carriage awaits.
It's exhausting being King of the Alley.....
Your father and I think this whole 'King of the Castle' attitude has gone straight to your head
"Cats Rule" is really just a saying...
But Imperial cat food was on sale
He indicates, from now on nothing below mice queens.
now that you mention it i have noticed some changes since we switched him to fancy feast
Look, we're just saying that maybe you are misunderstanding our generosity a bit
No, we are not getting you a dragon!
It's been over six months now, so you have to accept that he wasn't talking about you.
It’d be cute without the gout
We were wondering if we could leave you with a vet while we go on vacation this year.
I know it means "king," Rex, but it's just a name.
We never should have started using Royal Cat Food
Oh, c'mon, honey, you're going to love summer camp!
The President called; he wants his cat back!
Your son Tyrion wishes to meet you at the royal litter box.
Sitting on your tail ain't that easy after all
Well, now, the Lion King is now just another tired puddytat
Maybe we shouldn't have let Li'l Henry binge watch "The Tudors" with us.
Perhaps we should have had him neutered.
So what exactly happens next in Cat of Thrones?
You know, you're really no Morris.
It appears King Donnie is resting and plotting his strategy for Kim Jung-un.
Good idea, but I don't think he's into it.
His YouTube video wasn't even funny.
This is so hard to tell you ... but the Albacore Tuna that you like so much is on backorder.
You simply can't play the role of Trump in this household!
We know you're disappointed now, but your Iron Throne will be here by next Sunday. If you sit on the back of the sofa, you can watch for the delivery drone.
Says he's tired his role of King of Our Domain and would like to return to mouse catcher.
I guess next we will be getting him a dog drawn carriage.
He doesn't feel he is king without a scepter
Don't feel bad. You're not the only cool cat Trump has fired.
We sleep in the bed to. You didn't conquer anything.
As your benevolent ruler, I can assure you that mice will no longer be a menace to my kingdom.
I'm going to have to draw the line at decapitating his second wife.
You can always go back to selling real estate.
He looks a little bored. Can you think of anything else we can bring him to pounce on?
Seriously, Your Majesty, could you float us a loan?
As I started to say ... tragic news. The Waterford serving dish for your free range chicken liver pate has been broken. We'll have to make do with the Steuben for a bit.
Does the book say when we will notice the effects of experimenting with our household's power structure?
Qu'ils mangent de la brioche.
Your Highness, perhaps some funny human videos on You Tube would amuse you?
I see, and how does this make you feel?
Don't you like the solid gold litter box we bought you?
How did this happen?
I thought you brought the stray cat home.
He wants to know if you liked Miles better in his bebop or hard bop phase.
He hasn't enjoyed playing autocrat ever since the election.
If it please the kitty-kat, may we watch one of our own shows now?
Told you we should have had children.
I had no idea one can of wet food would lead to this
Um...yeah. Taxidermist, huh? I didn't know.
Truly, Your Highness, not a crumb of cake in the house. You're going to have to swallow your pride and eat kibble.
I think its time to hang up your hat.
You might want to show a bit more initiative with the mouse catching job.
Felix, we think it's time for an intervention.
I think he's taking the" King of the Jungle" to heart
Maybe you should just try walking along the fence tops and howling at night, like the other cats do.
When you pick your successor, remember I'm the one who cleans your litter box.
I think he lost his soul when we moved to Washington.
How about a constitutional monarchy?
Sorry, Your Majesty, you can't behead us until you learn to use the can opener.
Not sure this new meowarchy is working out.
So what's the decree? Are you going to keep us?
I think we're ready to be parents.
It means we don't have mice.
Yes, your name is Cersei too, but you're not a Lannister and it's just a TV show.
He really thought Charles would be king.
Do you think the fact he has five legs is bothering him?
He truly was the most pompous and imperious of cats, Ward, and we loved him so. But do you honestly feel this is the proper way to honor his memory?
It's tough to rule during the dog days of summer.
If you don't feel like tuna, we can do chopped liver.
Next he'll want to trade his litter box for a litter.
We live to serve and obey. Really, we do!
You're no queen, Helen.
Maybe your subjects would show more respect if you took up Tweeting.
If it makes you feel any better, we miss Ned Stark, too.
I did not tell the Queen that it was a very little mouse.
Another pawlitical victory for Mr. Flufferson
A cat may look like a king.
We have gold plated the litter box, sire. Have any further commands?
When he found out that lions were the king of the jungle he decided to become king of the living room.
He said it's a working vacation, so I think that's ok.
I think it is time for a royal diet
Your Highness is as far as I'll go. God is out of the question.
Puss should no longer watch the news
I told you we should have named him Pup.
So you understand now...we really love you in a way so much better than Netflix
No Way! This is not a jungle and he's not a king.
I did warn you: "Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown."
He jut heard William and Kate will get the throne.
Would it be alright if we came back on Saturday for our next counselling session?
I thought he was just a tabby, but down at the shelter they did say he was a rex.
Queen Elisabeth never had it so good.
Would your highness like mommy to peel you a tuna ?
Spoiler Alert! Guess who thinks they won the Game Of Thrones?
No, she's not like the Illuminati, we gave her all this voluntarily. Perhaps the crown was a mistake.
Sire, I'm afraid the aristocats blocked the measure in Parliament.
I'm so sorry, Pookey. All that way to find out Gene Kelly only dances with mice!
Ernie's been such a royal pain ever since we put him on that new gourmet sardine stuff.
We love you even if Viceroy of the Livingroom doesn't get as many likes as King of the Forest
I just wish I did not feel like a vassal to a worthless king.
Of course the litter box is your domain ... but we must go in and clean it at times.
So now its "your miaugesty"?
What do you mean she doesn't use a litter box?
Sorry, Sweetie, but you misunderstood. The expression is, 'a cat can look at a king.'
Maybe naming him Henry was a mistake.
Permission to change the litter, King Twinkle
No boots, no king,Puss
He doesn't seem like Himself today.
Heavy rests the crown . . . but the kibble is low-calorie.
I'll put up with your pampering of 'Queenie', but I draw the line at being the royal taste tester.
"Boneless mice"? A very fine decree, Majesty! But we have the dog catapult to finish first.
Your Majesty, no changed cat foods, even if I have a coupon.
Looks to me like he's on his 9th life.
We never dreamed you'd want a consort. Please forgive us for having you neutered.
Purr Majesty
Not so regal out of the wild, is he?
I'm so sorry RoiRoi. The new food wasn't gluten free after all.
The king needs to cut down on the royal wet food.
No more "Game of Thrones."
Whatever you want, we'll do it.
You tell her we're out if the king crab.
You should never have given him a crown.
We shall remove the litter box from behind the throne Your Majesty!
We think fealty is your best defense Your Majesty
I'm just praying he doesn't institute prima nocta.
Caught one lousy mouse and now he's Simba, King of the Jungle
She doesn't look much like a "your highoness."
Chauncey, we need your advise about Real Estate Investment Trusts.
Just because you used to parol the 9th hole at Bedminster, that's no reason to go all megalomania on us.
How about if we soaked it in tuna juice?
well he's old now, wants to abdicate..move in with Pope Benedict.
I think we should stop buying 'Fancy Feast'. It seems to have really gone to Sprinkles' head.
The 2016 US election led Pat and Jerry to consider swearing fealty to a monarch.
His lordship would like to watch a cute mouse video tonight.
Yes, we will talk to Burger King, but don't get your hopes up.
I have called his insurance provider.
We’ve done everything you asked of us, your highness. Now can we please get a puppy?
It could be worse.
Honestly, I just feel honored to still be of service.
This place is a dump.
Tell mom she was only supposed to be Queen for a day.
We got rid of the dog
London, the Queen, now what?
That hairball really did look like Joffery choking.
Are you sure King Joffrey is the direction you want to go with this?
We're cutting off the catnip.
I call him the Prince of Purrsia.
You should not have told him he is no longer king since Trump took over.
Yes, the litter is clean now.
This was much more of a theoretical metaphor before November.
Don't take it personally -- the Special Counsel plays cat and mouse with everyone he investigates.
This place is kind of flashy.
...but if you did abdicat, who would be the heir?
Even the cat loves Game of Thrones.
Naming her Queeny hasn't worked out so great
For dinner, I should like the turkey with giblets, gravy on the side, with iced 2% milk. Make it so!
how do you want your fish to be cooked today, my highness?
Your majesty, whom should I serve for your dinner?
I know we encouraged this behavior for Instagram, but it's time we talked about your mouse catching duties.
Monarchies don't last forever.
Talk about entitled!
You want me to cut the salmon in half? And give both halves to you?
You just had to call him Frederick, didn't you?
Tell us again how you wrestled the crown away from Charles and fled during the Brexit.
Bullshit, Fuck, Bullshitter, Buullshiit.......He heard David Remnick say it on the WTF podcast about Donald Trump.
He's waxing sentimental about his days as an outdoor cat.
We kinda liked you as our pet.
Your throne is now in the garage.
Abide by your midnight curfew or you will be throne out!
No, it actually does stink. That's why we get clumping with odor shield.
I don't know honey, looks like a bad case of Crowns to me.
I guess fat cats still rule!
Maybe in another life.
Sorry Muffy, we're not sure beheading Fido is legal.
Now, if we had named him 'Snuggles' instead of 'Rex' ...
Catatonia Regium. I read about this in vet school. Our doting has placed our cat into a perpetual state of delusion.
They told us he had trumpian tendencies.
I think it's the cat food television commercials.
One nursery rhyme trip to London to visit the Queen, and look what happens !
This all started once we gave him social media.
We understand it's like a jungle sometimes, but you shouldn't have to wonder how to keep from going under.
Who gets custody of Queen Fluffykins when we get divorced
Too much Game of Thrones?
Wot doth thou mean? Ye hath no grey poupon?!
Game Of Litter Boxes
I saw him talking to that monkey, Rafiki.
I think Donald was a fitting name.
Don't feel bad, Fluffy. Even lions get tired sometimes.
Felix, we've already named the dog ‘King.’
Humans, you're probably wondering why I've called you both here. The litter is a bit dusty and the food is far too dry....
We request that Your Highness should use the litter box.
This cat rules with iron paws.
How can we help you, your meowjesty?
He says he's our real president.
So we realized that you didn't even catch half of the mice, which means that technically, the throne still belongs to the toaster-cleaning parrot.
Not exactly King of the Jungle material
"When we agreed on King at the animal rescue,I thought you meant that nice German Shepard".
You're right, we do need to see the animal psychologist.
Abdication would destroy them.
Of course you can be Simba for Halloween, sweetie.
Sorry snookums,, there can only be one Mr. Mistoffelees. Remember: there are no small parts, only tiny kittens.
We are only getting a small dog, you'll still be the King of the house...promise...we feel your pain.
He knows we worship the ground he litters.
But a SEDAN chair is out of the question.
Your highness, there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.
We're yearning to breathe free.
Since he's been crowned he just doesn't know what to do with himself
The crown is only a distraction so he can play more golf...
Oh King Cole was a purry ol' soul, who finally admited he had no use for the bowl.
Aum. Comfort, my liege. Remember who you are. King. I had forgot myself. Am I not King? Richard the Second, ACT III. SC. II
Honey, I think your Ancient Egypt course is confusing Muffin... er, Cleocatra.
With all due....this is not Africa.
Wait until you see his litter box.
Sire, will it be French or Italian cuisine this evening?
We work like dogs to make him feel like a king!
It's 'look AT a king,' not 'LIKE a king.'
Do you understand his latest edict? All I'm hearing is 'Meow' over and over again.
I hereby proclaim that all dogs be banished from my kingdom
I knew it would come to this sooner or later. The whole family hated the job!
It's OK Sweetie. Henry the 8th had six wives, not nine lives, but you're still special.
All those prince and princess kitties could not possibly be yours. We saw to that years ago.
I think that Queen's brand cat litter went to her head....
Who died and left you King?
But you said you wanted to be Cat King to make Felincia great again !
Maybe they can change their votes
Did we overindulge him?
This is the taxidermist idea of a regal pose?
Great, so it caught one damn mouse?
Maybe the gold-plated catnip was too much.
We should keep him Princess, he cleans your litter box.
He thinks he's Fluffy the XIVth.
The return of Game of Thrones has really shaken up household politics.
I found him at a second hand Castle store.
I know we called him "Rex", but he's a dog and needs constant encouragement.
I forget, is our new ruler a 'His' Majesty or 'Her' Majesty?
So this is how Persian catnip works ...
Pussy Trump really does think he's in now in charge; how delightfully delusional!
When will he give us crunchies?
Your needs are important to us, but there are limits.
LION; not lie-in, is the King of the Beasts!
It's an honor to work for your administration.
I like Game of Thrones too but this is overkill.
Ignore the cat, Larry—I have chlamidyia
He must've raided the boa's feeder again.
I'm thinking it's time to restring the violin.
I'm just not in. This is 'jumping the shark' when it comes to cat videos.
He definitely not fit to be a king.
Look, if you want to be emperor, even you will need clothes.
Even if cats rule, you still have to use the litter box.
The vet said that one stick of Imperial margarine won't kill him, and the side effects will wear off.
Cheer up. Your ratings can only go up.
So, your Majesty, do you really think 'playing cat & mouse' with North Korea will truly lift your ennui?
Let's try opening up another can.
Stop sulking. you still have 8 lives to go!
Next time we're going with a dog.
´We just added a little olive oil to its bowl.´
I guess we'll call her Queenie.
Princess Fluffy learns of the addition of Prince Fido to the kingdom.
Stay positive... you always land on your feet.
May we please scratch your back?
When were the self esteem injections supposed to take effect?
But, was now really the best time to adopt a Russian Blue?
Sadly, he's an Egyptian Heirless
I promise, Julius, we did not mean the fleece bed as an insult. A king size would not fit through the front door.
If you're that tired, I know a lion who said he just couldn't wait to be king.
Cooked right he will taste like chicken a la king
We named you Prince after the singer.
I named him ... Donald.
I still want a baby.
Could the boy be right? Maybe he isn't really wearing any clothes.
Remarkable. So much wisdom in so few purrs.
He thinks he's above chasing mice.
In fairness, her litter box actually doesn't stink.
Can we get you something for your catnip hangover, tabby?
Don't worry, it's normal cat behavior!
Look here Tiddles, I think we need a serious talk!
They are famous for their paparizza.
Winter is here.
Their attitude has always ruled.
Rex or Fluffy? What do you think?
It's official. President Trump just tweeted that they are NOT related!
Just another day in the life of a fat cat
My kingdom for a parakeet!
We're trying our best to make things up for the neutering, Rex.
He speaks the lines beautifully, but I think Henry V should look a tad more regal.
If only we hadn't named him Donald.
Perk up. Think of the residuals.
The chiropractor can see you Tuesday.
Looks like a cat nip overdose.
He's not "King of the Jungle" but around here he Rules.
Now that the big cats are extinct, I'm afraid he's it.
Just because you're now king doesn't mean you can start grabbing pussies.
I didn't think when I brought home the ermine-trimmed robe, you would go out and buy a crown.
Your blood may be royal, but you only have 1 life left.
It's not easy being "King of the Snuggle."
It's really more of a castle than a jungle here, so give me back the crown.
He needs one that's carried on the shoulders of four men, and one that clumps.
Yes, your cat food is now dry, but your power remains the same.
Don't get discouraged. You've been well-groomed. Royal positions are just tight right now, especially the UK.
Looks like his mouse chasing days are behind him.
It's clearly an advanced case of catatonia
So, in the end King Louis lost his head.
Do we always have to go through your communications director?
You'll be king of each house.
And here I thought the sword in the stone thing was just a myth.
We need to put a string in your step.
Dad and I thought it's time to tell you your birth mother is a cat.
Your Majesty, we must update Adobe Flash again.
You have to trust me - this is a different type of reign.
Just like you, he thinks his litter box is his throne.
Our backyard is a bit like a jungle.
I'm not sure this is what the vet meant by "royal treatment."
"That's how he supports his base".
Henry, we'll get you a new cat companion but this is our sixth and last attempt.
His "King of the Jungle" poses were kinda cute at first. But the deranged proclamations, of late, are getting much too Trump-like.
I miss Rover.
Yeah, you can argue that it's constant torpor, but I would NOT want to challenge him to a game of chess.
Friskies lies the head that wears the crown
"So being King of Youtube isn't all it's cracked up to be, is it"?
If you won't talk to us about what's bothering you, will you at least Tweet about it?
How did I know he was going to use that phony voter registration card to VOTE!
Yes,we are all going on vacation to Paris, and NO , you cannot fly First Class.
King Kitty's gout is flaring up again.
He's bummed, they said they wanted someone a little more human to play the part of Joffrey Baratheon.
You hope and you pray, but The Revolution still seems years away.
Your father and I love you very much, but we don't condone litter in the house. Period.
You named him " Donald", and then let him watch Fox News, SO You get to deal with it.
We know it's not the same as being king of the jungle, but can't you make the best of it?
He has everything but a catatonic heir.
I know he's been down in the dumps, but maybe we took took, "Give him the royal treatment," too literally?
He commands you to clean up the dog's drool.
Call him Leo, not Tabby.
Yes Bob, I'm pretty sure your dating profile listed only cooking and gardening as hobbies.
Isn't it obvious?
We were ok with the dog, but we want our son back.
His highness must still use the cat box.
It's about this 'prima nocta' idea of yours...
No, you're not King of the Jungle, but you ARE a Fat Cat!
We're sorry, Tom. If we'd known about that heir to the throne thing we wouldn't have made that trip to the vet.
I know this might sound catty, but I think the king might be getting a bit lazy.
We assumed you knew there are millions of other cats that ruled over living rooms.
Yes, the lion is the king of beasts. But you're a house cat.
Excuse me, Purr Highness...
A therapy cat was a better idea in theory. We shouldn’t have to work this hard for his attention.
I thought we elected him President.
...and another thing. That 'litter' idea has to go. Unless you both join me there!
I think we need an intervention. This 'king of the castle,' has gotten too far.
We need to rein in your reign.
"Tom", we are impressed with your recent DNA results, but don't you think "King Thomas" is just going a bit far?
What would please H.R.H., King of the Poopy Closet, Earl of the Enclosed Garage and Recycling Bins?
He may be meow-nificent, but I don't like his cat-titude.
Do you think Fluffy had wanted a more elevated throne?
How can we tell her that we are out of mice?
Perhaps it's Tweeting Overuse Disorder
Which one of us spoiled him the most?
Well, to be fair, if we had known at the time that you were the last surviving member of the Meowntbatten bloodline I don't think we WOULD have had you neutered.
He just found out he's not really "King of the Beasts"
Well........ what kind of caviar do you want?
We should have gotten a dog!
I was talking about the milk in the fridge.
Stuck and stupid and vulnerable; in this mini-dark ages
Will prefer warmed milk or bottle water?
But my Lord, one cannot simply kill the neighbor's dog.
It's because we're your loyal subjects that we're switching to dry food.
You had to name her Cersei.
As you loyal subjects, we have to neuter you.
He wasn't happy being the king in the fable of the "White Cat"..Now he wants boots.
Abdication is not an option?
King of the jungle’s a rough gig, Muffins. Better stick with the internet.
I know it's tough when the vet said you only get one cheat day a week.
The pet store swares that this will help with house training.
All hail the Spayed King
He still doesn't look satisfied.
No, he is commanding you to clean his box.
You thought this job was going to be easy!
Let me a king for the day until she (the dog) comes from the Vet Hospital.
You're right, it isn't so good being King.
With or without fries?
Damn! If I had known that the job would be so difficult, I would have abdicated my throne.
Alexa does not understand "Meow"!
See? Why spoil him by letting him go outside?
Who's going to replace him when the inevitable happens? He's sired more than 500 kittens.
I promise, you don't have to go to the White House.
Don't you think that's a little much for the third trimester Leonard?
"Wow, we sure didn't expect this when we let the cat out of the bag"!
Do you think he's not taking his responsibilities seriously enough?
I know we always said anything is possible, but Elizabeth II is not going to abdicate to you.
We really can't put Fido in the guillotene
Mittens, we need to talk about Tuna.
Death to the dog jester again?
Ok, you're getting there, now the line is, "uneasy is the head that wears the crown."
Yes, you can still have your throne after the spaying.
Yes we will call you, the queen of the first cats, ruler of the seven kingdoms and her other realms and territories, defender of the faith and the lion of Judah.
Its just your name, buddy, You're not really a king.
Can't we negotiate, Pusskins?
She really took the name "Princess" to heart.
We've been through this. Catnip really IS a hallucinogen.
That Fancy Feast cat food is going to his head.
He doesn't like being the Danish King and wants to go back in his parabox and just be plain old unobserved Schrodinger again.
How relaxed you are in your innermost circle!
Clearly that wasn't catnip that we bought!
I think we should give him back his iPad.
Fired
I think we should stop buying Royal Canin brand.
I hate to break it to you but the Purrsian Empire collapsed eight lives ago.
The product review said it was "exquisitely designed to accommodate a regal slouch".
His official title is Henry the Eighth Life
Oh Wise Soloman, Got any better ideas for this month beyond just cutting it in half, as per usual?
i told you the wine would do this to him
Queen Donald did what?
So, who's Mister King Grumpy Puss today?
Please, just pretend to kiss his ring and we can go.
wrong throne, your litter box is in the garage
I think the king needs a queen.
SHORTLY AFTER I WATCHED A DOCUMENTARY ON EGYPT .
We share your angst about the imposter in the White House.
It's Lion King not Cat King
OK, we'll set the fb tv channel for you. But could you at least make up some real news by yourself?
Maybe if we changed his food.
You're a 'fat cat' alright, but not in with the top one percent 'fat cats'!
But Donny, dear, you can't believe all those praises and adulations. They're mice.
"You read the part on my profile about my thing for cats, right?
tom had another night in the alley that was a cat's meow moment.
Robert and I think you should stop worring about Khaleesi and start chasing mice.
Sorry but "King of the Jungle" is taken. How about "Dauphin of the Divan"?
We told you not to binge watch Game of Thrones!
He's purring about banning dogs and building a wall around his cat flap. The cat's been watching too much Trump!
I told you letting the cat watch Game of Thrones was a bad idea.
He's exhausted by his "King of the Cats" designation in the new Catlovers Encyclopedia.
I don't think he's going to drain the swamp. Let's call Orkin.
He's exhausted from his failed coup of the Puppy Regime.
We are definitely ready to raise a kid.
Maybe some creamed chipped mice on toast?
I told you not to name him Donald.
I guess we need to get a catnip coat for the jester.
I think YouTube worked better for you than Twitter, sire.
The new Catristocracy
Maybe you’d prefer benevolent dictator?
Yes, I agree. We declare you Donald
We want to make you happy, but we're not trading the house for a horse any time soon.
It is your turn to frighten a mouse under her chair.
What does the king cat in the hat need now?
Do you think the kids will mind?
He believes one great life is better than nine average ones.
He hasn't moved since the media misinterpreted his Tweet, six hours ago.
How did you know I don't have kids?
The Kids are asleep and the dishes are done, if you take the dog out I promise I won't "need an Aspirin."
What did I tell you, Charles, chefs ARE the new celebrities.
I know he reminded us of the President when we saw him at the animal rescue center, but it is time to take him back.
Checkmate.
Didn't you realize there's no way you can have a queen?
You are not gypsy. So stop calling yourself gypsy king.
It's his king meow suit
He thinks he's a lion.
Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown, right?
I apologize, but the royal line has been severed.
You say you want to catch your own mice!
I implore you, your majesty, we located another cache of those discontinued shrimp treats on Amazon Prime and they will arrive tomorrow. Please don't make us sleep in the dungeon again.
Naming him King Tut as a kitten was probably a bad idea!
Livingroom... Jungle... what's the difference?
I'm sorry son, but it looks like Daddy's Boy has made his final decision.
If we keep him up late enough we can sleep in tomorrow.
She demands three juicy mice, pickled and sautéed, for her coronation dinner.
You know this isn't the jungle, and you're not a lion.
" Did you feed her ROYAL CANIN? " ( A Veterinary brand of pet food)
We like dependency on your low prices.
Seems that the bird had won first prize at the bird show.
I was deposed; she was next in line.
No idea where the cat came from
I swear, it's not kittens, it's a hair ball, Trichotillomania overload.....
Why doesn't he have a dick? Where is his dick?
Do you think he'd be happier if we left him alone now?
She was in the room when I was watching "Cleopatra" on the TV.
Nice move ten years ago calling her "Flabby".
I don't know what to say....I wish Johnny Carson were here.
Sorry, l can't face dinner.
Evidently, he is playing to his base.
What time would your Highness like to have dinner?
Where's the bag?
I think this matriarch took her spaying to heart....
He sleeps, perchance he dreams of mice, ay there's the rub."
Do you think we went overboard on the adoption party?
I preferred him in the kitchen.
Maybe we could import some mice.
Let's not get another chihuahua.
King Cat? I liked him better when he was just Fat Cat!
Sire, the prisoner still will not speak. Shall we try the vacuum?
We are not his subordinates! We are his equals.
We should never have named him Henry.
That catnip really worked!
I said roasted pheasant, not peasant.
I think we need to put him on a vegan diet. And no alcohol!
I just know I am a shoe-in for the position of White House cat. My orange tabby is a perfect shade.
What is it going to take to get you to act more like a dog?
Fluffy, sometimes you can be a royal pain in the butt.
Meow that again, Your Pussiness .
He even has small paws.
Dad? Do you think he'll grow into the job?
'Twill be a Fancy Feast fit for a king, Majesty!
Honey, maybe we overdid the binge watching of Games of Thrones and didn't carefully ration the catnip.
ME-ow, King Donny; you can do anything; by yourself.
I'm a cat person.
You see what happens when the salmon is not Wild Alaskan !
Son, Mom and Dad don't have nine lives.
"Heavy is the head that wears the crown"goes for cats, too.
And guess what he gropes?
The trouble is that back in your day you and Mom had completely crazy ideas.
Had your fill of mice mi'Lord?
Your majesty, the new jester lives across town. In a veterinarian's office.
Your cat videos are fun, but we'd like to see more tweeting.
He has been like this since he came back from Saudi Arabia
Maybe if we got her designer boots, she'd exercise more
You were the one who wanted to call him Rex!
But, this morning, you seemed to really like that food.
How did they get "Alexa" to understand feline?
I told you not to let him watch Game of Thrones.
So, is it really so good to be king?
Mommy and Daddy can't make you king. Only the cat food company can do that.
You're a fat cat alright, but the outfit and attitude have nothing to do with it
> he's become his father, honey
We just can't train 30 neighborhood dogs to stand guard outside our house.
You want him via our divorce. I want him via our divorce. Maybe we should stay married!!
Where is the thrill I am supposed to feel in presence of royalty?
Was the salmon souffle just right for your tummy, your highness?
Yes, it's lonely at the top.
"It's your move".
I'm your Royal Consort, not him.
He just doesn't seem to realize that he's only a cat and that "Life's a Jungle" is only a metaphor!
His only command is "meow."
Harold, we can have sex after you feed Edward and clean out his litter box.
I jested yesterday.
Like I said, we can't get 'those' back. For the last time; can I get you anything? Will you just look at me, King Cat Stevens?
I know...he'll be gone by tomorrow.
He's just expressing his true feelings.
But putting sand over all the floors will make the house less-clean.
Don't feel bad. It's just fake news.
A cat may look at a king?
Do you like this outfit on me?
Do you need a nap?
He hasn't been the same since he found out Lear dies at the end.
Sir Donald, the news of the staff colluding with the neighbor's dog is fake.
Something is rotten in this housing estate.
He has committed treason by suggesting a dog; but if it pleases your majesty, mercy should be granted. Perhaps he might be banished to the garage?
He likes it ! If we could get just enough people to vote for him, he will become one !
He was tired of being called Princess.
Someone she's acquainted with must be King of the Jungle.
Frankly, for all practical purposes, we've reached that point where everyone says you have no clothes.
Oh, for Pete's sake!
Ever since we got him the throne, robe & crown he seems to think things are purrrrfect.
The king of the rats has had one to many!!
Isn't it time you cleaned the litter tray?
``Whiskers, it's called an intervention. We're concerned about the drinking. We love you.''
Our marriage was good until we took him off cat food.
What do you think? Caviar for dinner or fois gras?
I TOLD you naming him 'Your Highness' would go to his head!
I told you, binge watching Game of Thrones was a bad idea!
To Fido we"re royals. To the cat we're the peasants.
Is Reggie really the king of us? Honestly, Hal!
Are you sure his pedigree says "King Cat?
Your Majesty, are you saying, "Cats First," or "Cat's First?"
Why are you so quiet, dear? Cat got your tongue?
Waiting for the cat's meow
So I asked myself, "Why stop at fancy feast?" And just look at me now.
Okay, next time you buy the cat food!
O.K. Donald, what are the rules this week?
No more TV for our dear Copy Cat!
I like my New York style Pizza delivered in a New York minute.
He claims he has a divine right for his favourite spot.
We've put in the order for that single-origin, organic catnip you prefer, it should arrive within a few days, so sorry for the delay.
Just think of it as body sculpting, Tom.
The bakery's all out of Blackbird pie, do you think he'd be OK with an anchovy pizza?
This place is a real dump!
Waiting for Daphne to wake up.
Our cat thinks he rules us
Dad,where did Donald Trump say I could grab her?
Who would you like to sleep with tonight?
Are you sure he is not the author of the Art of the Deal?
Do you think he's Leopold I or Leopold IX, because this is getting old?
Snow, you are not allowed to learn from Cersei Lannister
I knew, believe me.
Cheer up, there will be another auditon for royal cat food.
Felt every cat owner ever.
This chef is adored by the pizzerrati.
You were an outside stray before we invited you in but now you've taken over please learn to use the kitty litter box
I knew he was an alpha male, but never imagined he would become king of the concrete jungle.
I told you, the shoeshine boy said he will be back in a minute
Dogs have owners. Cats have staff.. We are here to serve you, our Lord.
We're sorry about the queen size litter box we ordered.
Maybe we went too far with Trump's 'Make America Great Again - for Cats'.
So much in the name of democracy!
Would you a filet mignon, or more of that mushy crap you used to enjoy?
One problem with royal rescue pets is the possibility of a royal recall.
Sorry, but we're out of bluefin tuna. Would puffer fish be okay?
Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown...
I knew we shouldn't have left "Game of Thrones" on.
We appreciate your transparency
He is mad - we hid his scepter.
I knew it was a mistake to call him Trump.
I will have the duck and encourage you the same.
I don't think he really cares about the Republic, Honey
We just don't think Haru is right for your son.
Let's just hope he doesn't rule with an iron paw.
This job is really more than I bargained for, big league.
The emperor has no claws.
Your highness, you still need to behead the mice yourself.
I'm just saying that under the right circumstances dating could be healthy for me.
He was happier when he only looked.
..I went to see the Queen....
Tell the truth - were you licking the margarine again?
Told you we shouldn't have named him Donald
Care for your boots, Master Puss?
Should we bring the royal laser pointer?
Fulfilling my genetic imperative is exhausting!
Pardon me for grabbing you.
He's been reading Trump's tweets again
Leo, hot dogs and weiner dogs are NOT the same.
And I thought you were telling the truth
His shrink says he suffers from egomania-catique.
Can you blame him? He just lost his 8th life, recently.
It's just easier this way.
Didn't he realize when they made him king for the day he would have to forfeit one of his lives?
We know Cat & Mouse is traditional, but we don't understand the rule of engagement!
Avoiding being grabbed isn't easy, but you've earned your crown the right way. Good girl!
We should never have called him Rex.
'Well, you did insist on calling him Donald ...'
Jungle, living room... same thing to him.
It's your turn to change King Fuzzbutt's litter box.
It's time to start acting presidential, Your Highness.
I thought Aunt Ira said his name was Ming.
First of all, this isn't the Jungle.
Perhaps the second course of training was too much.
You may rule us, but only bowser can be our best friend
Our King of Cats is having a problem sitting down...maybe that "crown" is a bit much for him...
That orange haired man tried to grab me again.
Aw, how cute. She's getting her first paralysing pang of regal remorse.
Your highness, why did you poop in my shoe?
the all feline production of King Lear is not for another 3 weeks, you don't have to stay in character all the time.
I'm sure I mentioned that neutering is the household rule ...
Do you think that we pamper a little much?
Honey, it's just the pizza paparazzi again.
Now that you're king, will you be needing a special kind of litter box?
I had anticipated that ruling the household would be more satisfying.
"Prince Pawsome... if the YouTube bits are too strenuous, would you consider a few dozen still shots for FaceBook, Instagram, and Twitter?
Ok, now get me the dinner.
Leaving Tommy"s old school play outfit laying around was a huge mistake.
I should have stuck with the milk....
I always said you looked like your mother but I never understood why she left me for another man.
This anti-monarch feline insurrection was just a matter of time Henry.
But Fluffy this is your ninth life
It must have been the extra vodka shake.
Yep, we just wait until she decides what she wants us to do.
Now that he's too big for his britches, shouldn't we stop enabling him?
Even if Charles abdicates, you're not going to move past William.
I know he thinks he rules the house, but did you have to get him a crown?
The President likes tweeting, it hasn't helped me capture a single bird.
OK Kevin, it's time. Call Guy.
I guess it doesn't apply to the urban jungle
He's taken this "king of the suburban jungle" thing a little too far
Have you ever tried to sleep on concrete?
I think he had a little too much cat nip!
Please don't worry, Your Highness, we'll call the puppy "Prince" and he'll live outside the palace.
The silver spoon & the cradle when you were a kitten is OUR fault, but now you've gotta let it all go.
Elizabeth gets fleas, too.
A cat may look like a king.
I'm not going mad, George. He distinctly said, "Winter is coming!"
"No cradle, no silver spoon but it'll be ok".
Sorry Fluffy, it is only the Presidency that is Imperial
I told you he shouldn't try out a ninth time for that part. He's too brave to pull off the Cowardly Lion role.
I see, well let's start with your mother.
I just dare him to grab my pussy.
We promise to keep the royal litter box smelling like roses for a year if you'll only permit the use of the palace for a dinner party this Saturday.
The dog is not a court jester...
We're tired of your fake mews.
We can't afford to go to "Lion King" again. Why don't we stay at home and we can rent "What's New Pussycat" instead?
Okay, no more "Kittypants", but, "King" and "Prince" sound kind of "doggy".
And then the wise Queen banished all dogs forever and they all lived happily ever after!
I don't think he should watch Masterpiece Theater with us any more.
Just because you named me Napoleon, doesn't mean that I have complex.
A puppy doesn't mean Mommy and Daddy love you less. Look, they got you two therapists.
Should we tell him about his new cloth?
Now, Honey, remember we told you that being king is very, very hard.
This isn't tyranny, is it, hon?
He's worried this place is going to the dogs.
I've called this meeting to discuss your divorce and my fair cat alimony in the settlement.
So, let's see if we've got this straight: You thought it was "reigning" cats and dogs, and the dogs won.
His kingdom for a what...?
I *told* you Rex was a dog's name.
Whiskers, it's almost February and we think it's time to take off the Haloween costume.
I'll bet his Macbeth is the cat's meow.
Mouse ears in Disneyland would not be a good carreer or public relations move.
They're snapping the last Atlantic City fluke.

We do understand how hard it is to know that you're just a paper tiger.
Alan, there is nothing wrong with being a prince.
He's disappointed with his subjects
I'm glad we never let 'Spare the Rod and Spoil the Child' apply to Mooch.
We need to talk about your sashimi-grade ahi habit
Queen for a day is one thing, but I refuse to catch live mice.
Well at least it was a stalemate!
He is commanding us to bring him the mouse head on a silver platter.
We warned you that cats never cooperate.
The Intervention
The vet thought a one-chair palace would best suit his needs.
It’s your fault. You praised Henry here, simply for his regal feline demeanor. I said base it on something measurable, like the number of cat treats he eats every five minutes.
No, YOU spoil her!
He thinks he's the King of Siam.
We know that you think that you're doing a fantastic job... but you still can't fire us!
I told you, he is expecting a bigger crown.
I fear codependency, George.
You Highness, a bath has been run
And on top of it all, he wants a belly rub!
You didn't give me ermine and a crown when I was pregnant.
Your grace.
Our regular taxidermist was out...
This definitely makes up for not having kids.
Ok, how about "Pussycato Magnifico"?
One mad dash across the Cardinals' baseball field, and he thinks he's royalty.
This is not an intervention, Ralph. All we ask is that you don't throw up in our slippers.
You need to workout more
I always order the Paparazzi Pizza. It's not that good but the presentation is fantastic.
Do you think he can sing, 'If I were king of the forest'?
Our protest against using endangered species as rugs may have gone a tad too far.
You are so cliché.
Bring me your pipe and your fiddlers three.
His jester is a piece of string.
Proceed...I am listening.Bar
I told you this would happen if we named him Louie Catorze.
Well Boots, we're sorry you feel your cat's meow lifestyle shouldn't include time outs.
He wanted to be in charge, but now he isn't sure what to do.
Duchess, we've done everything you asked. Now, where is Pluto?
I told you letting her pretend she was Marie Antoinette would lead to no good.
I hear Scaramucci's available.
"I guess that's what they mean by 'The Cat's Meow'".
So you didn't catch that mouse, but at least you tried.
So, they crowned you 'King of the Cat's Got Your Tongue' at your club?
He's really rubbing it in our faces now.
Has the rear appendage always been a problem for you, or just since the coronation?
Too much catnip for the Queen Bee!
His tummy tuck produced illusions of grandeur!
You know you’ve hit bottom when you’re in a cat cliché cartoon.
If you want to be treated like royalty, you have to wear the get-up.
Your turn for the royal litter box.
I think we should reconsider sending him to Outward Bound.
He just got his own show on NetFlix
Honey, I've tried everything from coat hangers to twine and I can't seem to get His Highness to sit up in his throne!... I .... I'm really at my wit's end!
Admit it -- naming him Joffrey was just a bad idea.
Will it be fish or chicken this evening?
Let them eat discount cat food.
No, sire, we have yet to find the lair of the rod dot, but we have our best people working on it!
That's NOT what we meant when we told you to stop the tweeting!
Was the litter box remodel your idea or the cat's?
Maybe we should stop calling him Fat Cat
"He has had delusions of grandeur ever since seeing "The Lion King".
Heavy lies the crown, Mr. Tibbles.
You may be the King of Cats ... but you're still just a damn cat!
Fido left home when Tiger usurped the crown.
Would your Highness like his warm milk now or later?
We really do need to cut back on the carbs.
I think he's missing his old life before he became 'King of Beasts'.
Dad, can we not have fish again tonight?
What outrageous fortune, your highness?
Declawing guilt. We have to get over it.
"Soon as this getup takes effect, Old King Cat will be a merry old soul again!
We're talking about that naught word that derives from "fornication under consent of kat."
King Kat, Regretting All He Ate today And discussing it with his owner's.
But where's Jimmy?
Are you positive that's ermine?
You know, she's been acting strange ever since the start of the new season of "Game of Thrones"...
You know, Honey, I'm thinking that this demand for a daily mouse served on a silver platter may just be a little extreme, even for Fluffy.
Honey, I'm afraid he's suffering from Post Trumpmatic Stress Disorder!
We've been sitting here for over two hours, when do you think his majesty will let us get up and start our dinner?
Meow your grace.
Maybe if you truly felt like our little king, you wouldn't need to prance around as this absurd caricature of a king.
But, Your Majesty, we've tried to meet your every knead.
I told you we should have limited his "wizard of oz" screen time
I was at the Elton John Concert last night. After Rocket Man he sang, You're so Vain, you probably think the song is about you.
The Emperor has no clothes!
Definitely unpresidential.
We've found too many velvet furballs laying around the house, my Empurror. I think it's time we get that winter coat off you.
"Your Purr-ness?!" The shelter really ought to warn you about this sort of thing.
I preferred the Elephant.
What would Dr Seuss say?
I'm concerned we've let The Donald's "Let Trump be Trump" therapeutic role playing go a bit too far.
Hamstring me a gazelle, would you?
The day Felix found out he had been surgically altered are a young kitten.
Lion King domesticated...
I can tell you, it's no good unless I can have your complete loyalty and forgiveness for everything.
Honey, we need to clean. The cat thinks he's the king of the jungle.
So, he is related to the king of the jungle, eh?
Unfortunately, catnip king is not an official title.
At least it's HONEST...
I told you we should have gone with the fish.
... and they froze all his assets to pay for the cat toys ...
We just wish that you not tweet so much, OK?
It's the Trump syndrome.
It never occurred to us visitation rights "every other weekend" means "every other season" in cat years.
It's your turn to juggle the kibbles.
Your majesty, we come to you asking that no more fur balls wind up in the kingdoms bathroom
Succession should be peaceful now that he is neutered.
So your not King of the Cat-sle
Give him baking soda
Yes, you're our pet but why do you want us to hate Bo?
Game of Thrones won’t be your last opportunity.
Well it's cheaper than a grandchild Well it's cheaper than a grandchild,
No, I said a cat can look at a king.
I liked it better when he thought he was from County Cheshire.
Do you really think we'll get his weight in gold.
It's not the steak, it's the ketchup
Another game of chess?
It lacks a human element.
Yes, the ermine is expensive, but we recycle the furballs.
His Mother slept with some Targaryen apparently
I'm sorry, but I've decided I'm going to start having sex with the cat
But you wanted to eat the canary.
So many cats to tweet--so little time.
He's just reeling from the Magna Cata
I think we have to go with the full coup d'etat option, dear.
Yeah, let me go, though, because I've gotta start tweeting some shit to make this guy crazy.
You check the mouse traps and I'll go milk the cow.
Don't be sad that there weren't many who wanted to have an audience with you. When we elected to adopt you, we weren't thinking of a monarchy at all.
OK Fluffy. That's enough of the gold and stuff. But we are definitely NOT going to allow you to change your name to Donald.
He cant say your majesty like I can say Your majesty.
And after wrestling that piece of pizza away from that NYC rat I became King Kat.
I thought you said this was a quiet little bistro!
This place really treats you like a movie star.
'I've gotta say, "Cats: The Musical Chairs" isn't very good."
Frailty, thy name is feline.
Why are you surprised that you have indigestion? If Twitter can't stop his tweets, eating the bird won't stop him.
Ben and I are worried that an iron throne of swords would be even less comfortable.
We want you to take your throne and go.
I don't want to hear any more excuses. Lose the dog right meow.
Cheer up, sire. Your strategy to distract them away from the tax return issue has gone well.
Yes, we are sorry, too. But all kings can't have tiny hands.
It's tough being head pussy in charge.
And you're going to build a moat around his litter box, too?
They're famous for their pizza.
We must be the court jesters for allowing this
"...And then the Genie said 'Okay Donald. You wanna be a king, I'll make you a king'" ?
Look - this IS the strippagram.
You wasted two wishes to see the cat to be a king and have a thrown, now we have to use the last one to get rid of her.
The shift from kleptocracy to Catocracy was surprisingly subtle.
Marie Catoinette, we need to hold a catnip intervention...
'Let's call the apartment Graceland.'
The typical Leo from "King of the World" syndrome.
Well at least he won't shed...
I told you we shouldn't name him Henry.
I bet this looked great before it 404-ed
Yeah, I did. I beat both Trump and Kim Jong Un in a pie-eating contest.
Em'purr'or wants us to stroke its fur!
Don't you think it's time you took off that stupid crown, claiming to be a descendant of the Cheshire cat and went back to chasing mice?
When this Rex goes, I say we get a Maine Coon.
The Vet suggested "Pamper Camp" they help obese cas recover He's not a spoiled, pampered cat he's just a little out of shape!
We don't mind your 'holding court' every night ... but do you have to dress for it?
'The Trump Method Of Empowering Pets' is becoming worrisome.
The yelp review did say the pizza was instagram-worthy.
Look Lebron, you are the top cat still, but Kyrie thinks he's the alpha dog......
Didn't we ask the waiter to go light on the paparazzi?
Catleesi, Winter is coming...
Well, Rex and I don't think all pampering is spoiling.
I told you naming him Henry was a bad idea!
Do, cheer up darling..let's sing the Mozart duet..
I agree you have 9 lives, but I'm not renaming you Cersei Lannister
She just hasn't been the same since Lord Mittens ran away.
King? OK, maybe I'd feel better if you named your dog "pussy cat".
That Access Hollywood footage just took every bit of majesty out of him.
Honey, let the groomer take care of him next time.
Lady Jane Grey your 9th life is up.
I warned you not to call her Queenie
Get your leashes
I think he's starting to realize it's a jungle out there.
No dogs.
And I thought I would be the one placed on a pedestal.
It could be worse. Minus the feet, you'd be the King of Pain.
No slouching if you want to be on YouTube!
Help us understand this sudden identity chaos.
Your turn to scratch 'His Royal Heinie'
It's called growing up.
But you wanted to be President of the United States.
Felix the Ninth, this is probably the end of your line...
Don't listen to the dog. You ARE King of the Jungle.
Do you think the cape's too small?
Bad Mr. Mittens! Not until we hear from the College of Heralds.
As we have said before - where does Sheeba sit? Anywhere Sheeba wants.
Looks like the Clooneys are eating in again tonight.
He may be our leader, but I'm just getting tired of the hissy-fits.
Feeling displaced? Why would you feel that way?
Some cats don't have everything you have so we were just donating some of your old toys to the shelter. So you see you can still be just as happy with what you have here.
He says he doesn't want to be a King in his next 8 lives
Sure, being king of the house is great, but we think it's time for you to step up and become king of the jungle.
Would you like a chin strap?
Our poor dumb cat wants to imitate Trump.
Maybe we shouldn’t have fed him grapes.
He just found out that even with 9 lives, he won't live long enough to succeed Queen Elizabeth.
I think her new food is a little too salty. What do you think?
Let's call him The Mooch.
Good try, but here the Kardashians are the aristocrats
Bring me the dog, I'd like to slowly push him off the couch
Cat got your tongue?
It's not you, it's the reign. All cats hate the reign.
You there, bring me more chicken.
A tonic for this cat? I don't think so.
He's killing himself making America great again. Sad!
I really think it's time for the monarchy to go.
We got you the throne. We got you the crown and the robe. But Fluffy dear, we're not going to call you "Rex." That's a dog's name.
Let them eat mice.
Do you really think "My kingdom for more catnip" was such a great idea?
I don't care if you're king, Fluffy-- I'm not getting you a Twitter account.
What if we promise to change your litter every day?
Honey, I'm sorry, but we have to cancel our vacation...
Why the big puss?
Where the Wild Things Are, The Sequel: Scene 1, Take 1.
Remember when you just couldn't wait to be king?
Stop letting him purr-suade you honey
We don't mean to intrude but there's a mouse in the garage...
I guess Princess is all grown up and ready to rule.
No, the mice won't listen to us either
Was dinner really that bad?
Sorry Prince, your reign of terror is officially over !
...and we don't even have to read The Little Prince to him.
The vet said it is the post-modern ennui virus. He says all the cats have come down with it.
Now we have a king.
No Sugar, we can't snuff out ALL the dogs just because you want to.
Seems depressed, after we took away his tweeting toy.
He's been this way since he ate our Doberman.
We should have never sent you to college.
"It's your move".
No, Mommy and Daddy are not going to get you more cheese right now.
A dog would be your subject.
We get that the chase to the throne is more exciting than ruling, but you have to work with McConnell.
So stop sight your baby, and be happy again...When you're smiling!
I'm sorry. He found my Instagram.
Turns out he's making a statement about the imperial presidency.
Just because female cats are called queens doesn't mean you're the king.
She's not feeling purrr-fect!
This is not what they meant by "Lion King".
It must be the grain-free cat food.
Mittens... we know you've been using our HBO log-in details.
We bring news of plots to dethrone Your Majesty upon signs of any more poop outside the royal litter box.
White Russians don't sit well with Russian Whites.
It's not that we don't support your passion. We just think you're taking the Henry VIII tribute a little too far.
He wants us to purr before him.
Ideal choice. This one hasn't been clawed off.
He just couldn't wait to be king
And to think my ancestors fought in the revolutionary war to free us from royalty.
Oh, alright. We’ll stand at the curb and cheer as you go by.
No more HBO.
We would just like to have enough left over to have health care too.
Being named Henrietta doesn't make you Queen!
When would you like to dine?
Keep reminding yourself, "I'm a lion trapped in a cat's body."
But can a king who looks like a cat look at nothing?
I can't wait for the dragon queen.
No, it's NOT a joke, it's my life!
Look with 2020 is just around the corner so if we can get the cat lover vote...well you do the math.
It's just that imported silk is much pricier than yarn.
He's a Millennial cat.
Tell us about the pillaging sire
You really think this will stop him from peeing on our couch?
Huh? So, where's Owl and my Beautiful Pea Green Boat?
You're taking this lion- thing too far."
He's a real 'Royal' you know; a 'Royal' pain in the ...
Do you ever feel that Kitty is kinda taking us for granted?
Sorry honey, we just didn't know how to break it to you that you aren't actually king.
I suppose he won't be settling for Cat Chow from now on.
Just remember - this is not a game.
I'm beginning to think it was a mistake for us all to binge watch the Game of Thrones.
L.G.B.T??
It seems Donald has gotten some clothes.
It has been this way since instagram gave his account the verification badge
Are we overindulging his 'king of the jungle' complex?
i kinda wanna suck off this cat
Do you think we cheated him of the values he'll need to cope with life?
And this "rescue" dog comes with a goldfish and a canary...
Baby, you were adopted
Today it's a reigning cat. Tomorrow, who knows?
And we loved you so much we named out "Queenie." It's a good name, darling, but that's all it is. We are not your "liege men," and you can't order Buddy to be beheaded.
In my opinion, King Thomas sounds more royal than King Tom.
Your approval rating is at a historically low 50%...
Quit milking it, pussy.
I still think you should use the kitty litter. Your Highness.
Good news, darling: Henry has abdicated the throne—and believes you should become the new King of the Cats.
I hear they got their pizza recipe from Alec Baldwin.
Poor thing, Trump thought he was a she. His family jewels will never be the same!
King partied too much last night with the catnip
I know you want another belly rub, but don't you think 20 a day is a bit much?
They won't leave this King of the Cats thing alone.
What kind of mouse would you like tonight?
Only you can unbanish the laser pointer.
I think this cat is really starting to come between us
He's been this way ever since he saw The Lion King
When I grow up, I can clean the litter box!
No! I did say 'glitter'. I said l-i-t-t-e-r... 'litter'
How would your royal highness like his cat food prepared? Or would he prefer fish?
Banished?
Should we have rethink the name Empurror Puffybottom?
We should have used a lighter material.
Don't sell yourself short. Remember, a lion was supposed to have that crown.
I know you think we use you as a tool of transference, but somebody's got to do it.
I just wish we knew he didn't really want to be king before he accepted it.
We'll inform the press that your 'Let them drink latte' tweet was ironic.
Meow, meow, ennui, ennui
let 's change tack and call our next cat "cataract" and avoid any need for costume jewellery
Yeah, we were worried about the cost, but we gotta let Nicole be Nicole... just going to see where this takes her.
It's time to take us out.
Even though the mouse got away, you're still the King of the house in our eyes.
But it's not like they show "King Rat" on TCM a lot."
Well, Puss, the store doesn't sell boots this time of year, so you will have to wait for Fall.
Lester Holt: "So when did you discover your cat poops diamonds?"
I would rather have a potbellied pig
Louis the 14th with claws
Please tell us what you want.
No one's trying to mercury poison you.
So it's a game of cat and thrones?
Yes, we know kings had someone to wipe their bottoms, but you're a cat.
Look, Flea Bottom’s not real, Smokey, it’s just a TV show.
We do value your needs as higher than our own needs.
That's it, we're calling him "Trump."
We would need to be Fat Cats to support your kingdom!
Yes, we know you're the king of this castle.
Sir, the Queen prefers cats to corgies now.
How 'bout this: separate feeding bowls, shared litter box, you get the patio in the morning, he'll have it for two hours every evening.
The purr seemed innocent...
We're holding this intervention regarding your demand for a daily dinner of fresh, not canned tuna and shrimp...
So, just when everyone started calling me the King of Beasts and then this had to happen.
Even a King couple can look at a cat.
... It was a bad idea naming him Trump.
Like Lear a king without a throne!
He thinks letting cats into the Westminster Dog Show was a really big deal
Sir David Attenborough says I'm a member of the cat KINGdom , hence the outfit and that means peasants I'll have my vermin sautéed and served at 6 pm sharp!
Now as King, you'll be in charge of the house finances
"Look Tom, think of it as a two-fer!" They would only get in the way anyway and without them it makes you look thinner! Win, win!
I think it's time for a social media vacation.
His Highness has deemed you acceptable as a live-in servant-you may now consider yourself as Feline Sanitation Engineer, Bedwarmer-Second Class, and Food Provider on Demand Provisional. Sharing of His Human is non-negotiable.
Great idea to have chosen career over children!
Felix... We need to discuss your curfew, so take that crown off your head NOW.
I was wondering about calling her Porphyria. What do you think?
Thanks, Rex. Now it’s your turn, Dad – what are YOU offering as a role model?
I see that but what dose have to do with Trump
Can he have it back until he falls asleep?
Gingy took the wrong sense of the word "pedigree" at the vet's today.
He may think he's king of the jungle, but really he's just king of this lousy little apartment.
We promise this will be your last shot.
Mr Fizzles apologizes for nothing. Steve!
We bought you this ridiculous throne to boost your self esteem, but this is excessive
It's entirely your choice: You don't have to sleep with her if you don't want.
Naming him Rex was fine, but did you have to teach him French?
The neighbors just called; their cat, Clement VII, is all scratched up and they think Henry is to blame.
He says he wants to usher in an Era of Good Feline.
Could we borrow the car?
His ennui really concerns me!!!
Meow down!
I just detest the pizzarazzi!
Maybe I'd be treated like a Queen too if I slouched around like that all day only wearing a crown and fancy robe.
Let them eat Purina
This is just another example of what we have been talking about.
Don't worry, Felix, just tell us how you feel about it.
My Ex's all choked on Pizza, but I love it!
"He just keeps telling me over and over again that all he wants is a horse".
Queen of Spayed.
This Fat Cat needs to be dethroned - not to mention declawed!
I can't believe the EU turned down Our Grace Flufflykins's offer to negotiate Brexit.
I think the taxidermist did a great job done.
Shouldn't have let him see that movie, now its gone to his head.
No matter what happens you will always be our little king. I'm sure the "King of Thrones" people will consider all of your selfe.
I'm just saying, maybe the electoral college needs to be revisited.
So how do you feel about choosing mediation now?
Mouse flambé for dinner -- again?
It's time for some strange pussy.
Fat cat is still too obvious. They will think you are being fake!
"You'll have to get him his Big Macs from now on - he just Tweeted that I was fired. '
i didn't expect basquiat to reincarnate as our cat...
I think we should start making him clean his own litter box.
Ever since Trump mentioned the "P" word he tries so hard to emulate him.
It looks like Leo is all worn out!
Don't worry, feeling uneasy comes with the territory.
I'm afraid the cable out, Puss. They'll no Game Of Thrones tonight.
It's not you; it's him.
All he needs is a mirror
We tried, but the board vetoed your mouse pool.
King of the Jones's
I guess cofefe finally got him.
So did this kittykat have too many nips?
What's wrong with trying to improve yourself?
We understand Cleo, heavy hangs the head that wears the crown.
Well Kitty, your reign is coming to an end. I'm pregnant.
C'mon Puss, give'em another chance. He didn't mean to question your lineage.
We have been more than fair with you, but addressing you as "Calico of the Castle" is a definite NO.
We're sorry.A retirement account is a bridge too far.
There's only room for one queen in this household.
Old King-Cat-Acole Was a merry old soul,
You sound just like Mel Brooks!
Isn't it time you moved on from kitty litter?
Winter is coming.
The doctor says his reign is terminal.
I don't see why you wanted a cat with a pedigree. The other type is just as nice.
He wasn't kidding when he said our dinner would be here in a flash.
He hasn't been the same since Lady Olenna drank that poison.
Maybe I pamper Rex a little too much.
If you want to be a modern leader, you'll have to learn to tweet.
I think having him fixed might have been a mistake.
Dad, who let the king out of the bag?
And you wanted to get a stupid dog
We have made progress, sweetheart, and I thank you for your efforts.
We're sorry the ladies all rejected you.
For goodness sake, the Cavelier King Charles is just a dog. How 'bout we call you Queenie?
He's so beat
" I wanted the Tuna in Clam sauce " !
We understand that this is your 9th life, but don't you think this is a little too much?
Old King Cat was a very smart tom, And a very smart tom was he; He called for his bowl, and he called for his crown, And he called for his owners three
Off with Lucky's head, sire?
But you said if we were really, really good we'd get our phones back today. [NOTE: If possible, today in ital]
This is no time for a hissy fit your Grace.
Give him wet food once, and...
I promised you'd stop the leaks but he doesn't believe me.
He says will can still scratch his belly
We'll get rid of the dog if you'll stop tweeting.
They said it's Twitter withdrawal.
They are so entitled these days.
Kitty litter
I told you that naming him 'King' was a lousy idea.
The only trick he knows is successfully running a pyramid scheme.
Who do you think could have possibly thrown her?
A twenty percent approval rating with sewer rats isn't bad, considering they're your base and your dinner.
So if she had spent more time in Michigan.
You're going to grab them by the what?
He says we should address him as "The Donald".
..."the jungle...not the house" !
Bad news, Matt. My Fat Cat sat on your white rat and squashed it flat. Sorry about that.
Well, you have been treating him like he was king of the house. What other kind of attitude did you expect?
Everything about you is precedential, and we think you'll do great in the White House.
Chris and Emma chose a pet over parenthood and lived happily ever after
Yep, the cat can look like a king.
They said you could look at one, not be one.
He's devastated. The other dancers won't perform unless a mouse is named to play the "Mouse King."
Its OK, relax, the robe is in a better place now.
You should know it's true. You do have an older brother. He ran away years ago chasing some tramp, but now he's back and he is asking about the rules of succession.
I'm thinking we should have named him something other than Henry the 8th.
Since you didn't listen to listen to us on how many marshmallow mice are OK to eat, can we at least ask the Cat King to locate and plan to use the "royal" letterbox?
It's good to be the King !!!
Next time let's not use Trump's taxidermist.
I told you the sign, 'Free Kittens', was totally untrue, that pets cost a great deal, but I wasn't prepared for this.
I think that "King of the Sea" tuna we started buying for you, is going to your head!
I told you this beats the baby Dalai Lama.
Does "Your Majesty" need a treat?
Well, it definitely wasn't me...
I think I'm done with this taxidermist!
She thinks she is King Trump!
King my ass! You're just a cat.
My analyst suggested a sex-change for Henrietta.
Garfield called to say you are the greatest king ever!
He say's he's leaving us because he's bored.
Animal Planet was speaking generically. You're still the real King.
I told you he wanted the "scepter"!
He requests his chief-of-staff to be a general AND a billionaire.
It happens sometimes when you trap, neuter, and don't return to the colonies.
Our Orange Tabby has a comb-over under the crown...
Honey we think of you as a lion.
Did mom at least try to explain this to you?
Oh Covfefe, we thought you wanted to be 'King of the World'.
Puss and Dupes
i am not sure your combination of kitty litter and royal throne works for him
We warned you--it's a jungle out there.
He said he just wants to go back to being a tomcat.
At least we don't have to splurge on his haircuts...
What did I do to deserve being the one chosen for royalty?
Think of it as "adding a new subject"...
All we're saying is, we think you're taking this King of the Castle business a little too far. We already clean your litter box three times a day. So the answer is 'No, we're not adding 'Girls Gone Wild' to your cable TV.
What Happened
Sorry you lost your twitter privileges.
Never should have named him 'Henry the 8th'.
I'm afraid he's right, Fluffy - all of the tuna comes from a can.
We are a cat more sinned against than sinning...
We should have sprung for sable.
He's deciding if his command is 'errnt' or 'Meow.'
We're still not tipping him.
We need to give the cat a tonic.
They call her the crazy people lady.
Ironic, his for us orange.
I guess I do indulge him a little.
Well, to quote your favorite show, Game of Thrones, "You look a lot better brooding than I do."
Shall we name him Donald?
Tell me, Your Majesty, why you'd rather be the cat's meow than king.
But will the 99 percent be content to eat cream?
Ironic, his for us orange.
We understand it is your decree, King Whiskers, but we are not decapitating Snow Ball.
He only eats King Chow now.
We should have let him have one litter.
