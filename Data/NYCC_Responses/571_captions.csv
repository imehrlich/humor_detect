Now let's see 'em walk off with the bathroom key!
It was free, but the shipping cost me an arm and a leg.
Arrgh, we'll see if the bathroom key goes missing now!
I know. I know. I have anchor management issues.
I like it. Since the anchor arrived, no one has asked about my hook, my hat, or what happened to the parrot.
So I tell Pete, I'd give my right hand for an anchor like that.
Or you could just move the damn coffee maker.
Why does everyone assume it's mine?
Complain all you want but I haven't lost a bathroom key yet.
It's no wonder this place has struggled to stay afloat
Welcome to Arrbucks.
This used to be part of a chain.
Arrggh, it looked smaller on eBay.
Why? Because every mall needs an anchor store.
It cost me an arm and a leg...
The last one I left outside got stolen.
We're Starboard's. Starbucks is up the street.
Welcome to Sunken Donuts!
My ex-wife got the rest of the boat.
I'm working on my anchor management issues.
There's mutiny in the air. Also Viennese dark roast, but mainly mutiny.
5.99 at Starbucks and they call me a pirate.
Let's just drop it.
I'm sure whoever forgot it will be back.
You'll thank me when the big one hits, and all the other coffee shops are washed away!
When are they going to put that anchor aweigh?
Why do you assume it's mine?
They said they needed an anchor store at this mall.
I am thinking of opening a second store, but this will remain our anchor location.
I don't care what you think. We haven't had a customer walk off with the bathroom key since I thought of it.
It saved his life - he hung on to it till help arrived.
Wifi password is ANCHOR, all caps.
He's taking anchor management.
It's a metaphor. Deal with it.
It was either The Rusty Anchor or The Greasy Spoon.
Was to go to the booze cruise stop not the crew's brews shop
I didn't say a word when you showed up with that nose ring.
Because it adds a certain je ne sais quoi, that's why.
Strange ... I suddenly have a hanchoring for seafood
Anchors away? No, anchor's in the way.
Yaaarrr, well I don't think we need your bike in the break room either, Katelyn.
This restaurant has three locations but this is the anchor store.
I'm just working this job until my ship comes in.
It takes the attention off my hook
It's a metaphor; work with it.
The napkins kept blowing away.
Leave it outside? This is New York City!
Time to expand?
I said I had a HANKERING for a real good cup of coffee, you must have misheard me.
I've sunk everything that I have into this place.
The anchor is our logo. A mermaid would be stupid...no one would buy coffee from someone with a mermaid logo.
No, YOU need anchor management.
It's me emotional support anchor.
I know. I know. But it was my mom's.
I didn't gripe when you parked your bike behind the counter.
I wanted to raid the colonies, but noooo, she wanted to open an espresso bar
Why does everyone assume it's mine?
Sure, but when Tyler brings his beagle to work, everyone thinks it’s cute.
I lost the ship in a poker game.
I imagine you're all wondering where I got this hat.
It doesn't have to make sense, matey. We're in Brooklyn.
No one's gonna be able to steal the bathroom key now.
Would you rather I bring back the parrot?
You have your baggage, I have mine.
Oh, sure. Blame the new guy.
My ex-wife got the rest.
Better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it.
It was presented to me at my going aweigh party.
Why doesn't anyone talk about the 800 lb. anchor in the room?
Well, this place isn't going anywhere.
It's called "ambience".
People, please put the bathroom key back where you found it.
I'll be opening more stores but this is my anchor one.
I just feel adrift without it.
So then he said, "give me a hand with the anchor"...
Pick up for Queequeg!
Anchor management?! I'll show you anchor management.
My wife didn't like her birthday gift.
Well, a mermaid would've been trademark infringement.
Of COURSE it's an inconvenience. It's an ANCHOR.
Nobody complains about the Starbucks mermaid.
I got the hook from a shark off Bora Bora. I got the anchor from a South Seas frigate. And I got a caramel macchiato for Randall.
Someday, my ship is going to come in
The cannons were too dangerous. The parrot was too loud. What is it now?
Ahab! Frappuccino for Ahab!
Avast ye landlubbers-try to steal the key to the poop deck now!
If I remove it, I won't be able to call this place, Anchors in the Way Coffee Shop.
It looked smaller on line
Aye, and she cost me an arm and a leg.
I think I found the solution for the missing bathroom key.
You can't leave anything outside in this city.
It makes me feel grounded.
'Draws the eye away from my hook, doesn't it maties!'
My ex-wife got the rest.
And I suppose you aren't carrying around any baggage from your past?
What were you expecting, a golden arch?
Aye, welcome to Aarrrbucks.
What makes you think it's mine?
Hey, lady, does it look like we would serve decaf?
You want mermaids, go to Starbucks.
Abandon shift!
I'm overcompensating for WHAT?!?
My ad agency claimed the place needed a new hook
Of course I can't leave it outside. Someone will steal it.
No, I don't think it is taking the nautical decor too far.
And that's when I realized I had a flair for decorating.
So the captain says, don't forget my cinnamon latte. Tie a string around your finger if you must. So I say, captain, I don't have a finger. Well, says he...
It looked much smaller on the internet.
No it's not mine... for the hundredth bloody time.
Ok, who ordered the venti moccachino with cinnamon, extra foam  and an anchor?
Size doesn't matter.
And another thing--who's been plunderin' the tip jar?
I'm tired of people stealing the bathroom key.
Welcome to Starrghbucks.
Aye, no one will forget the bathroom key now.
It's called ambiance. Would you prefer the gang plank?
As if I'm the only one with baggage.
What happens at Long John Silver's stays at Long John Silver's
Call me Starbuck
My designer told me it anchors the room.
Piracy's a crime. Overcharging ain't.
Ye also complained about the parrot.
Welcome to Aaarrhh-bucks!
How many keys to the head have gone missin' since I come along? I rest me case.
OK, who removed the restroom key from the anchor?
Well, for one thing, it keeps you guys from staring at my hook.
It was hard enough figuring out how to get a ship in a bottle.
You should have seen the one that got away.
Call me sentimental
Arg. It looked a lot smaller on Amazon.
Arrrrgh. It's the only part that wouldn't fit in the bottle.
Relax . You won't notice it at high tide!
Aye, this here's me ship and Captain Starbuck's me name...but for legal reasons, call me Kevin.
Drop it. Just drop it.
That could belong to anyone.
Careful. That's how I lost mine.
We're now officially an anchor tenant...
It fit in better back when we were a Long John Silver
You'd be surprised what the ADA covers.

Arghbucks
What anchor??? It's the key to the men's room.
Drop it.
What makes you think it's mine?
Aye, we've got fair trade, but we especially recommend our plunder blend.
A gift from my competitor.
It's good to the last drop.
He just can't let go.
I'm not taking the anchor away.
Thar she brews!
It has as much to do with coffee as a mermaid!
Anchors in the way, me baristas, Anchors in the way.
It’s just a coincidence.
If I'd known you could rename hardtack 'biscotti' and charge eight bucks for it, I would've given up pirating ages ago.
All our beans be fairly pillaged.
We'd best steer clear of Davy Jones's Latte.
This is a diner, why would you think that we serve seafood?
I got tired of explaining "Grande"
Piracy at internet cafes just isn't the same.
Because I got tired of talking about the elephant in the room.
You're annoyed because the anchor is in your way and I'm grumpy because I'm trying to operate a cash register with a hook for a hand.
What anchor?
It doesn't matter what I say because a lame pun worthy of a Ziggy greeting card is going to win anyway.
I feel like something is holding this place back.
Who ordered the anchor?
Ambience, argh!
All of us carry some baggage from our past, don't we?
They say I have anchor management issues
Where am I SUPPOSED to put it?
If certain people would wear their eye-patches this would totally work!
With a yo-ho-ho and a mind yer own damn business.
Aye, it works. Nobody's walked off with the bathroom key yet
Don't worry! We're not going anywhere
Oh dear, me hearties, will it be killin' and plunderin', or will it be coffee and pastries? I'm so confused!
It were me mother's! What's it to ye?!!
It was me mother's.
I'm being ironic.
Ha, ha, ha... 'Keeps me anchored...' I've NEVER heard that one before.

Ishmael!
When YOU'RE Employee Of the Month, you can put whatever you want there.
We're going to need a bigger boat.
Say hello to your new bathroom key, you twinkle eyed varmints.
We used to work together.
Aye, it's a sad story: only anchor from Fox not caught up in the sex scandals, now makes a living as a tattoo model.
It's a conversation stopper.
One venti mocha latte with overwrought symbolism, your order is up!
Why do you all assume I am responsible?
The bike rack was full.
So last year I just decided to settle down here in Wichita
Mrs. Trump left her IUD again.

Yeah? Well this is the first time I've seen a $4 cup of coffee.
Or maybe, this diner got in the way of the anchor. You ever consider that, matey?
...And that was the last time anyone asked for the restroom key.
That’s what I get for hiring a cheap lawyer. She got the house, the ship, the parrot, and my right hand.
Keep yer 'ands off me lucky charm.
These kid's meal toys are getting ridiculous.
No one takes the bathroom key unless they really have to go.
I don't hear anyone complaining when you bring your bicycle inside!
Sorry, I just came from my other job.
Because sometimes, the hook just isn't enough.
No one gets irony any more.
The next person who criticizes me fanciful design choices gets gutted like a mackerel.

Easy does it matie – I lost my arm making a cappuccino back in ‘73
She got the boat and my right hand in the divorce. Deal with it.
I said I'm not interested in your anchor management program!

It is artisanal and single origin, matey. So, get off me back.
