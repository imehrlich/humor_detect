I admire your restraint.
Above all, we value restraint.
I admire your restraint.
OK. NOW we can discuss the election.
On casual Fridays, it's just handcuffs.
I see from your resume that you and I went to some of the same institutions.
I really admire your restraint
Your contract includes an escape clause.
Yes, actually you DO have to be crazy to work here.
Impressive resume. And you seem committed.
We expect all our employees to be committed.
I have some good news: We're letting you go.
Production is low of course but employee theft is down to zero.
I've still got my eye on that padded corner office.
We're really looking for someone who's committed.
Well, you did agree to binding arbitration.
Tell me about a difficult situation you've been in and what you did to get out of it.
So, no words per minute then?
That's five minutes without social media. Let's try for five more.
Well this is embarrassing. We wore the same outfit today.
The best part is that they never ask us to get coffee.
You're probably wondering how I called this meeting.
I'd have to be crazy to hire you. You can start on Monday
I'd help you, but my hands are tied.
Productivity may be down, but so are sexual harassment claims.
I can see you're committed.
I prefered the nicotine patches.
Can you describe a tough situation you dealt with in the past and how you managed to get out of it?
I could have sworn he said we needed to be "retrained."
Yes, you do have to be crazy to work here.
There's been too much finger pointing around here.
Can you type?
Tell me about a challenge you have faced and how you overcame it.
The first time through binding arbitration is always difficult.
As you can see, our escape clause is a little trickier than most.
On Casual Fridays we loosen our straps.
There's limited mobility in this company.
I appreciate your restraint.
Are you as committed as I am?
No, we don't do much outreach.
What's your exit strategy?
How is your typing?
When I look at you I see myself when I first started here.
Are you willing to be committed for the next four years?
I can see you're committed.
We don't really require hands-on experience.
OK. After our Thorazine shots, you can be boss.
Welcome to the new EPA.
So I see you're committed.
Casual Fridays I understood. Houdini Tuesdays, not so much.
I can't believe we wore the same outfit to work again!
On which medication do you see yoursef in five years?
How embarrassing. We've worn the same jacket.
It's just until they find who's been stealing office supplies.
Down the hall and to the left. Good luck.
I never realized that this is how binding arbitration works
You may find the office dress code somewhat restraining, but I've embraced it.
I thought they meant fiscal restraint too.
Turns out the asylum pretty much runs itself.
Actually you do have to be crazy to work here.
In retrospect, I think we should have opted for the patch.
I'm very impressed how prepared you are for this interview.
You know my door is always open. It'd be a real problem otherwise.
Unfortunately, there is no escape clause in your contract.
I can't believe we wore the same outfit today.
Can you tell me a little bit about yourselves?
Look, you knew when you signed the contract that disputes were subject to binding arbitration.
Blink twice if you'd like the job.
I'll just make a mental note of your complaint.
The job is yours if you're willing to dislocate.
I hit "reply all" once too many times. How about you?
You seem totally committed. We like that.
I recognize your concerns, but productivity is up 200 percent since we began physically enforcing our cell phone ban.
And coffee breaks are a no-no, but at lunchtime they do let us go bobbing for apples.
You don't have to be crazy to work here, but it helps.
We've apparently been hit with a restraining order.
Frankly, you'd have to be crazy to take this job.
You don't have to be crazy to work here. We'll train you.
So they're letting us run the asylum. Now what?
And of course, we loosen the straps on Casual Fridays.
I'll have to talk to the rest of the voices in this room, but I think you're perfect for this job.
Restraint is what we value most in our corporate culture.
Just what did you think ‘legal and binding’ meant?
If you can scratch my nose, the job is yours.
I can't believe we wore the same thing today.
I think you'll find the mental health benefits here are very comprehensive.
Try hitting escape.
I'm impressed. You clearly did your homework before the interview.
There, now we can talk about the election.
How did you put on your glasses?
Well, I'd be insane not to hire you.
You would fit right in around here assuming you aren't already committed.
Other than these we have the same chance of succeeding here as men do.
You would also get your own padded corner office.
First of all. I love your outfit.
We loosen up a bit on Fridays
Tell me about your personalities.
I know! And I get a seat on the subway every time!
And with OUR Weight Loss Program, you can eat anything you can get your hands on!
How is your typing?
Like they say: You don't have to be crazy to work here, but it helps.
The job comes with certain limitations.
We don't do touchy-feely here.
Now all I need is a signature.
This IS our healthcare plan.
I like what you've done with your buckles.
In five years I can see myself in the corner padded office...
Second time this week we've worn the same outfit.
Sorry, there's no wiggle room with the dress code.
We searching for candidates who are truly committed.
We're a pretty restrained group here-I think you'll fit in.
Nail biter. You?
Look at it this way! The theft of office supplies is down to zero!
Wouldn't you prefer non-binding arbitration?
Call me crazy, but I think you'll fit in just fine around here.
This job doesn't offer much mobility.
It's only for the next four years.
We're letting you go.
I guess I can't point fingers.
You'll like it here. We pretty much run the place.
Are you able to work within constraints?
You'll be getting the corner office with no windows and padded walls.
" You'd think the glass ceiling would be adequate
The walls may be padded, but there's no glass ceiling.
Unfortunately, your hands-on experience won't be very useful in this position.
At least the finger pointing has finally stopped.
Usually we start new employees with card tricks, but I see you're ready for something more advanced.
Yes, all of the cubicles are padded too.
Consider yourself lucky if only your nose itches.
I guess they don't want us adjusting the thermostat.
Is this your idea of binding arbitration?
Wanna go for a drink and unwind?
Verbal skills are a major plus.
It's awkward that we're wearing the same jacket.
Voice recognition software, mostly.
Corporate really admires someone who's committed.
Actually you do have to be crazy to work here.
The job involves a lot of delegating.
So, tell us a little bit about yourselves.
Well, I'm looking at the contract and it seems there's no escape clause.
I can't believe we both wore the same thing to work today.
Are you free tomorrow?
I did get your email, but I haven't been able to respond.
If I hear "You don't have to be crazy to work here, but it helps" just one more time....
Your resume says you're insane. I like that.
Okay. Now I think we're ready to discuss the election.
'But the good news is that we have casual Fridays.'
I think we all agree this is uncomfortable, but theft of office supplies is down 97%.
Around here, there is none of that you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours.
Well, this is awkward.
Tell me a little about yourselves.
No, I'm still allowed to practice in Texas.
Which institution do you see yourself in five years from now?
There's no glass ceiling here, Janice. In fact, no glass of any kind.
No, that doesn't sound crazy at all.
If all goes well, I'll be getting a padded office.
Can you type?
Yes, productivity has taken a hit, but office-supply theft is WAY down.
This ‘binding arbitration’ is getting us nowhere.
I preferred Casual Fridays.
And management wonders why nothing gets done.
I preferred the glass ceiling.
Well, I can tell you're bound and determined...
Answer my phone by the 4th ring and you have the job.
We're very hands off here.
Would I be correct in assuming your boss is also a control freak?
Welcome to social media rehab.
I'm not going to lie, bathroom breaks here are the worst.
You're hired. And welcome to the White House.
One last question, what would you say is your greatest limitation?
You remind me of myself when I started here.
Why couldn't Mankoff just tell us employees can't enter the caption contest?
A person would have to be crazy to want to work here. You're hired.
Before we get into the serious stuff, let me ask, how did you get those glasses on?
And at twenty-five years, you get golden handcuffs
Nope. Still gay.
Around here, there's none of that 'I'll scratch your back, you scratch mine.'
Our anti-texting campaign seems to be working.
I'm pleased to see you display the proper level of restraint.
I guess you DO have to be crazy to work here.
Welcome to the EPA
Okay, I guess we both got a little crazy at the meeting.
Sorry. I'm looking for someone with some hands-on experience.
On the up side, I've stopped biting my nails.
We can still butt heads.
So we're running the asylum. Now what?
Only on Mondays. Tuesdays he likes to be spanked.
I thought we could both use a mental health day.
You don't have to be crazy to work here, but it helps.
You seem like a perfect fit.
You're obviously perfectly suited for this position
God, I can’t wait for casual Friday.
I thought he said he'd be "retraining " us today .
Now we come to the part of the interview where we evaluate your problem solving ability.
Perhaps if I hit the escape key...
Yeah, it helped me quit smoking too.
We're really looking for people to be committed.
I think our corporate culture will suit you.
May I speak freely?
I think you are exactly the person we are looking for.
You have to be really committed to work here.
You'll be working with Congress.
I apologize for the inconvenience, Your Holiness.
I'm free Wednesday; what about you?
Are there any restrictions that come with the job?
Self-restraint is important in this job.
I'll say this--you know how to dress for an interview.
And we offer a very generous mental health plan!
You're hired. Welcome to The New Yorker.
...and how are your typing skills?
Welcome to middle management.
The asylum is running better since we've taken over.
Where do you see yourself in 5 minutes?
Doesn't every job have its constraints?
One other thing, this place is a madhouse.
Call me crazy, but I think you'll fit in very well here.
As you've probably surmised, the glass ceiling is going to be the least of your problems here.
And you can see this job requires no hands on experience.
I'm starting to think that "Ugly Sweater Day" was a better idea.
Tech support said we should just sit tight till they get here.
We think you're a perfect fit for us.
I miss finger food. Is that crazy?
I've got to hand it to you, but not just now.
Are you free for lunch?
No, You're crazy.
You do realize there are some restrictions that come with the position.
Tell me about a tough situation you found yourself in, and how you got out of it.
Sign here and the job is yours.
Call me crazy, but I think you'll be a great fit for the position.
It eliminates the bias of body language.
What we really need is a typist.
It goes without saying, we'll be working insane hours.
So, why do you want to work at Mad magazine?
It seems like nobody ever lends a hand around here.
So would you say you're a straps half-loose or straps half-tight kind of person?
Finally, we really are running the asylum.
Haven't smoked in a week. And you?
The company's smoking cessation program has really worked for me. You?
The work here is more cerebral, less hands on.
If you get out in less than 10 seconds, the job is yours.
Unfortunately, we need to hire someone who has hands-on experience.
Wow, you really did your research for this job interview.
I keep mine on until they find someone else to make coffee.
On the plus side, we never get carpal tunnel.
Butting heads is pretty much the only way to get things done around here.
At least my carpal tunnel has cleared up.
Karen, let's be honest, straitjacket Wednesdays isn't taking off like we thought it would.
Call me crazy, but I think you'd be perfect for the job!
In this economy, we're only able to offer our employees basic mental health coverage.
Loyalty and excellence are nice, but here, we're all about commitment.
You gotta be crazy to want this job.
We've taken binding arbitration to a new level.
Let's face it; we're both in a bind.
Oh, it keeps me from hitting “reply all.” How about you?
You have to be crazy to work here.
We both need to loosen up
Would you hit the escape key for me?
I'm tied up until noon, how about you?
We can't both be crazy, can we?
Yes, but in theory can you use Word and Excel?
So, I think we should consider inserting an escape clause at this point.
I can already tell you're going to fit right in.
I'm a nail-biter. What's your excuse?
We insist that our staff be fully committed.
Call me crazy, but I think you'd be perfect for the job!
Don't worry, we're not concerned about hands-on experience.
Concerning your raise, Brenda- I realize you're in a bind, but as you can see, my hands are tied.
Tell me a little about yourselves.
Finally, we are running the asylum.
Call it a hunch, but you seem well suited for this company.
It's really not so bad, over at the EPA folks are blindfolded.
I knew you were the right person for the job the moment you walked through the door.
If anyone calls, we're tied up in a meeting.
I see you've done your research.
Tell me about a challenge or conflict you've faced at work, and how you dealt with it.
Not sure about productivity but it cuts down on snacking.
Our management style is very hands off.
Now you understand that this agreement is fully binding...
I've got great news -- I gotta let you go.
You're bound to be hired.
Sexual harassment is way down. I just didn't foresee the drop in productivity.
REALLY?! I happen to KNOW Wonder Woman, and she DOESN'T wear glasses."
You seem well suited for this position.
They take binding contracts to the next level here.
I don't think anyone really thought through "Silence of the Lambs" Friday.
Nice jacket.
You've got to be crazy to work here!
I understand now that the agreement was binding
And how much hands on experience do you have?
It’s the only way to restrain myself from replying to his tweets. And you?
We're really looking for someone who can show some restraint.
I love your jacket!
well, you've demonstrated proper restraint....I like that
Congratulations, we have to let you go.
The thing is, no one's gonna hand you anything at this company.
You'll find we're not very touchy-feely here.
Call me crazy, but it looks like you're finally dressing for the position you want.
I think it's safe to say we both got a little crazy in our last meeting.
Typing is tricky, but sexual harassment claims are down 90%.
Remember, my padded door is always open.
I told them we would be tied up all day
Tell me, in which institution do you see yourself in five years?
I'm hoping to get out early today.
How fast can you type?
I like you, Karen. You remind me of myself at your age.
Nice jacket.
Quite impressive how you studied our corporate culture.
We believe in a hands off approach.
You remind me of me when I was your age.
You don't have to be crazy to work here but it . . . oh wait, you do.
Call me crazy, but I think you'd be just right for our organization.
You don't need to be crazy to work here, but it helps.
Don't you just hate being tied up in meetings all day?
We could use another pair of hands around here.
Five? Very impressive. Most of us here can only hammer out three words per minute.
I see we go to the same therapist.
That about wraps it up today
Of course men only have to work 70% as hard to escape.
Where'd you get your jacket?
OK, now that we can't text, let's talk.
Let's talk; I'm on a texting restraint order too.
I said you'd have to be crazy to take this job.
Is this going to happen to all of the journalists or just those in New York?
We've found that the jackets force us to solve problems rather than point fingers.
This job requires commitment.
We'd be sane not to hire you.
Remember when it was just the glass ceiling?
You get out first, and the job is yours.
What Cabinet position did you get?
You could have told me you were going to wear this today.
You have to be crazy to work here.
You remind me of myself when I was your age.
I'm sure you're aware the contract will be binding.
Unfortunately, we were looking to fill the position with someone a bit more psychotic.
You've gotta be crazy to want to work here.
It can get crazy around here. I think you'll fit right in.
Sorry to keep you waiting. It's a real madhouse in here.
The company enforces a very strict No Texting policy.
If you can escape before I do you're hired.
What do you see yourself escaping from in five years?
It looks like we have a binding agreement.
You'll have the corner office with the padded walls.
In my last job, I was chained to the desk
I think you're a good fit.
Guys love it. I'm not sure why.
You seem perfectly well-suited for the position.
I'm sorry but we're looking for more diversity
So let me explain our new Twitter policy.
Can I get you anything -- coffee, lithium?
Today's been crazy for me, too.
We find it helps with employee retention.
Some employees are complaining that our dress code is too restrictive.
I can't wait for casual friday
I like your can't-do attitude.
Unfortunately, we do not provide mental health leave. However, our cubicles are padded.
You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.
Sorry, but we are looking for someone with actual hands-on experience.
Mike Pence says if we wear these we will start liking boys
Your Restraint is admirable.
On a brighter note - there are bidets in all of the bathrooms
I don't see restraints just opportunity.
Mr. Houdini will see you now.
The job does come with certain constraints.
There are no back stabbers here, but watch out for head butts.
Make no mistake: You have to be crazy to work here.
The problem with our department is the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.
It's a crazy place to work, but I think you'll fit right in.
I've stopped smoking and lost 20 pounds.
...And while smoking is restricted to the parking lot, you can shriek and howl anywhere you like.
There's something strange about this company, but I just can't put my finger on it.
What's holding you back?
Well, I think that just about wraps things up.
Decaf, black, and with a straw.
I need you to be more hands on.
You'll learn after a few days with Team Trump a straight jacket will feel so comforting.
If you're happy and you know it ...
Before Houdini Enterprises hires you, there is one more final test.
How many words can you type per minute?
We're looking for someone with more hands on experience.
I know exactly how you feel.
I can empathize with your circumstance, but, I'm looking for someone to answer my phone.
But at least we get to run the place.
So, what attracted you to this company?
It's just until IT finishes updating the internet filter.
I must admit I admire your self-restraint.
I see you take a hand-off approach to management, too.
As you know, we take binding contracts very seriously here.
It's not bad here, we do have unrestrained Friday's
And what makes you think you'd be happy here?
I wish I could, but my hands are tied."
Describe something you struggle with at work and show me how you deal with it.
I think you're going to fit right in to the corporate culture.
Wish I could help you but my hands are tied.
I'm told it's so we don't cut ourselves on the glass ceiling.
You'll notice all our electronic devices around here are hands free.
On the other hand, you'll appreciate Casual Fridays so much more.
I see that you already know about our dress code.
So, you find our dress code too restricting...
Sometimes it gets a little crazy around here
What type of hospital do you see yourself in in five years?
He said not until we come up with an idea.
As you know, when it comes to running the asylum, we think it's important to promote from within.
I think you'll fit right in here.
obviously 'you scratch my back, I scratch yours' isn't going to work here.
Nordstrom Rack. Where did you get yours?
I see you've dressed for the job you want.
I think you may be perfect for this position.
Siri, google "escape from straight jacket."
Why no, you don't have to be crazy to work here.
So, I was actually hoping to hire an assistant who would be able to...you know...assist.
I think we've tied up all the loose ends.
It's not binding until you sign.
Personally, I think you're very well-suited for this job.
I think you're going to fit in very well here.
I have a feeling you're going to fit right in here.
Nail biting. What about you?
The flip side is we won't ever ask you to sign anything.
If I were you, and I think I am.
Your clearly qualified, but I need to know you'll be committed.
Welcome to your first meeting of Masturbators Anonymous.
So why should we grant you asylum?
Who did your buckles?
The corporate culture here is stifling.
What makes you think you'll be a good fit?
Shouldn't you be writing this down?
I see you are familiar with our dress code.
I preferred the golden handcuffs.
Don't worry, you'll fit right in.
Everybody's going to submit a caption about us being tied up in a meeting.
I think it's great that we're both showing much more restraint.
Pick your poison: institutionally marginalized or marginally institutionalized.
It all started making a lot more sense once we realised that you DO need to be crazy to work here.
Why do you think you are a good fit for our company?
You can't quit. Our contracts are binding.
I'm running out of wiggle room here.
Sorry to keep you waiting, it's been crazy around here lately.
The job is dreadful, but the benefits are insane.
You have to be crazy to work here. You’re hired.
The irony of this situation does not escape me.
I'm really looking forward to casual Friday.
Your behavior has put us both in a difficult position.
Welcome to the White House
I'd love to go to lunch with you but it looks like I'll be tied up the rest of the day.
We are deeply committed to a hands-off management style.
You must be crazy to work here.
There's no question that we are both in a bind here.
Where did you used to hope to be in five years?
This place is a madhouse.
Jeanie, we are so pleased to offer you a position with the EPA.
We can do it. We CAN go 24 hours without texting.
This is why I suggested the NON-binding arbitration.
Something tells me you're a good fit for this position.
Sorry, but nobody here has an escape clause in their employment contract.
I see that you are already acquainted with our dress policy.
Yes, they've definitely put us in charge, but I think there's a catch.
How can I help you?
I love your jacket!
That's very interesting; I find myself in a similar situation.
So, I gather that you're OK with our hands-off policy?
Does my hair make me look crazy?
Yes, you do have to be crazy to work here.
No twitter Tuesday is so liberating.
But what I miss most is retweeting delusional nonsense and brushing my hair.
Says here you type 100 words per minute?
As you can see, we have a no-texting policy at the office.
I think you'd fit in well here.
Look, I can see you're in a real bind here, but my hands are completely tied.
Can you type with your nose?
You're hired. Let's nod on it.
Welcome to middle management.
Obviously you've researched our institutional culture . . .
The small print in these binding contracts are no joke.
It's important to dress for the job you want, not the job that you have.
I'd like to help you but my hands are tied.
Are those boots slip-ons?
Are you free Tuesdays?
We have to shake the image that the inmates are running the asylum.
'You scratch my back, I scratch yours' doesn't work here.
Let's just agree to shake on it later.
You seem to be a perfect candidate to replace me.
Now maybe we can have this conversation without checking our phones.
In hindsight, well yes, we should have both moved to Canada.
If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands.
Welcome to cellphone addicts anonymous.
Looks like were both tied up today. Shall we reschedule?
Well, I think we're all wrapped up here.
I LOVE yours.Where did you get it?
Do you have any hands-on experience?
Something about my job feels stifling, but I can't put my finger on it.
My door is always open.
Yes, the hours are insane.
So, what do you know about running an asylum?
The dress code is strict, but we loosen things up on Fridays.
If you can get past the downside, ours is the most effective weight loss program in the industry.
Okay, I'll be the first to admit that our last meeting didn't go very well.
Perhaps we've gone too far on our sexual harassment policy.
Let's start by signing those release forms, shall we?
I see a lot of myself in you.
For once, I do know how you feel.
Your resume said 'creative problem solver'...
Siri, could you bring us two iced lattes, with straws.
When I see you, I see myself 15 years ago...
So we're running the asylum. Now what?
You'll fit in well, here.
This job requires someone with initiative and, most importantly, flexibility.
So, tell me why you feel constrained by the dress code here.
HR is pretty strict about hugs.
When you hired me, I said I could do the job with ONE arm tied behind my back.
Can I get you anything?
You met all the job requirements but failed the typing test.
Your success here is limited only by your imagination.
We wore the same jacket! Awkward!
We only do verbal contracts.
Where do you see yourself in five minutes?
It gets a little crazy around here.
They looked great in the catalog, didn't they?
I love your outfit.
If I could only reach the escape key!!!
I see the bind you're in, but my hands are tied.
I understand you have an issue with the company dress code.
You do have to be crazy to work here - but it doesn't help.
Now that you are comfortable Judy, I want to inform you that your husband and I are romantically involved.
I find it keeps me from replying all.
Where do I see myself in ten years? Here.
Welcome aboard. Working here, you're limited only by your imagination. Well, that and the straitjacket.
So you watch Fox News too?
This should eliminate body language issues.
Can we be strait with each other?
Why didn't you tell me you were going to wear that jacket today?
This is nothing compared to the red tape.
you'd have to be nuts to work here.
Your biggest challenge here will be the ladies room.
That about wraps it up.
'Fortunately you DO have to be crazy to work here.'
I'm concerned that you may no longer be crazy enough to work here.
I need you to cover while I escape for a few days.
My friends said I'd be crazy to take this job, but I think I'd be perfect!
I know exactly how you feel.
Well, it does keep us from pulling our hair out.
Goodbye, keyboard. Hello, voice recognition.
Am I crazy, or have we met before?
I miss the pantsuits.
Where do you hallucinate yourself being in five years?
I'm not OK--You're not OK.
Yes, we have noted a drop in productivity since the new dress code was introduced. Why do you ask?
No...surprisingly the greatest problem is the congratulatory head butt.
The boss was right. We're making 100% fewer mistakes.
I'd love to help, but I'm in a bit of a bind myself.
Well Jane looks like our hands are tied on this one.
I think I preferred Casual Fridays.
Yes, the inmates are running the asylum.
This may sound crazy ....
The first thing you want to do is install voice recognition
Most importantly, you've nailed the company culture.
They ran out of red tape.
Something tells me you’re going to fit right in here.
"I'm three weeks without e-mailing or texting. How about you?'
We need to think through our bathroom break.
I’ve tried to tell you – there is very little room for mobility in this company.
Jackets may be worn untied on Casual Fridays.
I think we've bonded enough for today.
Welcome to the new Republican health insurance market.
...and within a few years, I was running the asylum.
You escape before I do, you get the job.
This is certainly one way of keeping us off Twitter.
Why is it men never know what clothes to buy for women?
I was out in public wearing a fringed poncho. You?
No, there's no glass ceiling. But there are some other challenges.
Of course your cubicle will be a padded cell.
Obviously, we're paperless here.
Well, you do seem committed to work here.
You gotta be Houdini to get any work done around here.
So much for the right to bare arms in the office.
I knew if you came in we could wrap this up ourselves.
Are you sure you won’t mind being confined to a desk job?
Great resume Ms. Perkins, but I'm really looking for someone who can type.
Well to be honest we were looking for someone who could work the coffee maker for us.
I think you'd be a perfect fit.
Ok. Now, sell me that pen.
So, as you know, the inmates have taken over the asylum.
The question to ask yourself is, are you crazy enough to work here?
On a positive note, incidents of workplace violence have dropped significantly this year.
You're either mocking me or you're over qualified.
My door is always open.
Our corporate anti-theft program has been very successful.
It's been a crazy week.
I understand your position.
We only wear them on days there are donuts in the conference room.
Well I think you'll fit right in.
The Help Desk suggested I try hitting the 'escape' key.
I'm tied up today. Are you free tomorrow?
From what I see, you'll fit in well here.
They meant fiscal not physical constraint.
We were bound to meet.
Do you have casual Fridays?
Let me give it to you strait
What makes you think that you are a good fit for us?
I hope you will excuse me for not offering you coffee.
Didn't they tell you that the job came with some constraints?
The good news? We've broken the glass ceiling.
On Casual Fridays, we lose the ties.
Yes, I see that we are in a similar bind.
Your resume is impressive and you would certainly fit right in around here, but we desperately need to hire someone who can type.
I'd love to give you a raise, but my hands are tied.
You look like management material.
I can see you're in a bind but my hands are tied.
I’m tied up this week, how about next week?
Sorry, but I'm a hands-off executive and need a hands-on manager for this position.
All I said was, 'I'm with her.'
Sounds good! At my last job I had to work with one hand tied behind my back.
It's keeping us off facebook but I'm not convinced it will help with productivity
Yes, the company dress code seems a bit restrictive to me too.
Don't worry, I'll just take mental notes.
Welcome to Tweeters Anonymous.
Before I hire you, I have to know if you're as committed to this place as we all are.
It makes you nostalgic for the good old days of gag orders.
Raise your hand if you have any questions.
Looks like you'll fit right in here.
I'd love to help but I'm afraid my hands are tied.
Yes, the pay is equal, but the guys don't have a dress code.
You would be crazy to want this job.
Luckily, we can ask Siri.
Everyone told me I should dress for the job I want.
You have to be a little crazy to want this job.
I've found I can do this job with both hands tied in front of my back.
How fast can you type?
Vera Wang - And Yours?
Sorry but we're looking for a hands-on person.
I'm sorry, my hands are tied.
Yes, no problem. Zero words per minute is perfectly fine with us.
What makes you think you're well suited for this position?
I like to help you out. Unfortunately, my hands are tied too.
They got to me before I could put my eyebrows on.
How many words per minute can you peck?
This job requires commitment.
Dd you tell them we'll be late because we're tied up at the office?
I think you'll fit right in here.
I see you’re dealing with some post-election issues as well.
It really is the best way to keep from looking at your phone.
I'd like to help. But our hands are tied.
We may be running the asylum now, but we're not abandoning all protocol.
Call me crazy, but I think you're perfect for this job!
Apparently letting us run the asylum will cut down on the overhead
Unfortunately, we have to let you go.
It seems like you'd be a good fit here.
Ok, now we can talk about the election.
I understand that you're in a bind but my hands are tied.
How about after work we grab a little Thorazine?
Psychotic Tuesday's just doesn't have the cache as Casual Friday.
Our dress code is very strict but I think you'll fit in just fine
No vacation days, but I can give you a corner cell.
So...this is going to sound crazy.
Hands-on experience is overrated.
These touch screens drive me nuts too.
Business is crazy right now. When can you start?
So tell me, why do you feel you'd be a good fit for this position?
Why does it seem like we are always tied up in meetings?
Pills, gum, and the patch didn't work. This better work!
You're committed, we like that in our staff.
I think you have what it takes to work here.
yes my nose is itchy too
You heard right. You do have to be crazy to work here.
So what made you decide you wanted to be a fact-checker for Breitbart?
Company benefits include two 15 minute medication breaks per day
I'm tied up on Tuesday as well. Does Wednesday work for you?
I think you will fit right in.
We believe our workers will be more productive if they can't text or tweet.
Thank God for Siri!
How weird, my nose stops itching the minute I take mine off, too!
Well, I've always said "dress for the job you want"...
I see you've done your research on the company climate. You'll fit in well here.
Looks like someone is dressing for the job she wants.
Now that we're running the asylum, we'd be crazy to abandon all protocol.
You can have the job if you can scratch my nose.
I'm happy to see you are finally following the dress code, but now I'm receiving complaints about your attitude.
welcome to the team. I'll show you to your padded office.
Is your nose itchy too?
I'm not just the owner, I'm also a client.
No, YOURS is a strait jacket, mine is a deluxe kimono with hand warming pouch.
I can't help you... My hands are tied as well.
We'd be sane not to hire you.
I think you would make a good fit here.
I pride myself on being a hands-off manager
You say you can type two words per minute.
I will be so glad when this goes out of style.
I knew you would fit into our organization the moment I saw you walk in.
I think you will fit in here nicely.
…as if the glass ceiling isn't enough.
...so naturally, when I heard that the lunatics had taken over the asylum, it seemed like the perfect opportunity.
You have to admit, it solved our texting problems.
So I guess we're not going to shake on it.
This is embarrassing. You should have called me and told me what you were going to wear today.
Crazy? At this company we like crazy.
You're not the first person to complain about the uniform.
My initial impression is that you will fit in just fine here.
If you scratch my nose, you're hired.
We're bound to succeed.
Let's talk a little more about your experience running an asylum.
I think you’re going to fit right in here.
Coffee?
Kudos to us for our mutual restraint.
Actually, I can empathize with your being late. I have been tied up myself this morning.
While the position lacks wiggle room, it makes up for it through an added sense of security.
We promote from within the asylum.
The good news is that all our computers accept voice commands.
The key to this position is restraint.
So what makes you think you're qualified for this position?
Is that your phone or mine?
First the glass ceiling now this.
First the glass ceiling now this.
It's so we don't cut ourselves on the glass ceiling.
We gotta be crazy to work here.
The real challenge is that they want it in writing.
I appreciate that we both share a high level of self-restraint
As you can see, things are just crazy here at the moment.
On top of all this, I am tongue-tied.
We've narrowed it down to you and Hannibal Lector.
We're going to have to let you go.
I need you to be more hands on.
So... it says here that you have experience in compliance.
HR really cracked down on social media in the workplace.
Restraint appears to be your strong suit.
I thought the suggestion box was anonymous.
I told you this job would make you crazy.
The bind leading the bind.
Yes, you must be crazy to work here
You’re bound to get promoted.
Hey! Same shirt!
I preferred the glass ceiling.
I know how you feel.
How do you keep your hair so neat?
You seem like a good fit for our organization.
It's exhilarating being off-med.
I'm thinking about having our department be a little more hands-on.
I'm sorry, Linda. New White House Press Corp policy.
I see your bind, but my hands are tied.
We think you're management material.
I've cut down on my texting.
Yes, it does gets a little crazy here sometimes, but I think you'll fit right in.
So, what makes you think you're a perfect fit for this position?
I'm afraid our hands are tied
I have to pee.
You don't have to be crazy to be work here but...
Why yes, we do have an office dress code.
I'll just send that one to voicemail
Okay, you're hired. I like your style.
Oh don't worry. It's just until they get that crack in the glass ceiling repaired.
Admittedly, it is keeping us off Facebook during business hours.
I think you’re going to fit right in here.
I didn't think 2016 could get any worse.
It seems like you'll fit right in.
It's only for the next four years.
Unfortunately my hands are tied on this one.
Unfortunately, we cannot offer any lateral mobility.
You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours.
I'm pretty sure the therapist suggested bonding, not bondage, Mom.
I think you'll fit right in around here.
Well, one of us is going to have to change.
What unique skills can you bring to Houdini, Houdini and Houdini?
Did you see yourself stuck in this same position 20 years ago?
Where do you see yourself in 5 minutes? 10?
We've never been big on touchy-feely at this company either.
Binding arbitration hasn't solved anything.
Our philosophy here is simple: first, do no harm.
Well, I could say the same about you.
With my nose.
What I'm offering you is an unbinding contract.
It's the only way I can stay off Twitter.
After "casual Friday", "srraight jacket Monday" just seemed to follow.
I think we're bound to succeed.
The office culture is a bit restrictive, but you get used to it.
As is our policy, this will be a binding arbitration
Like me, I can see you have great restraint.
And you had to ask for a binding agreement.
Welcome to our anger management program.
Our business depends on strong verbal skills.
"I'll understand if you need some time to respond".
If you escape first, the job is yours.
Men just don't understand what we have to go through every day to look like this.
Hi, Siri. Find Houdini straight jacket escape instructions.
I would say my management style is a little more hands off.
Your move.
I tried to adjust the thermostat too.
Welcome to the Trump transition team!
I like your style.
I think it is time we loosen up.
I'm sure you will fit in here.
Well, you certainly appear qualified for a job here.
This is standard procedure for all exit interviews.
It's not the glass ceiling that bothers me so much.
It's not as uncomfortable as an underwire bra!
It's just through the inauguration.
At least we only clicked on recipes. You should see what they did to Trina for downloading porn.
To answer your question, Ms. Lopez, you don't have to be crazy to work here, but it does help.
``Remember when the EPA was a fun place to work?''
I'm wish there was another option, but my hands are tied too.
I'd like to help you, but as you can see, my only possible response is a tired cliche.
It seems we're in a bind.
We have a hands-off management style.
We are a hands free workplace
And, just what makes you think that you can do this job as well as I can?
No, really, it looks much better on you!
Remember how we used to jokingly refer to this place as an insane asylum?
They elected Trump and we're the crazy ones.
Guess they're serious about the new no-hugging policy.
And he hasn't even been inaugurated yet.
In the olden days, people just exerted self-control.
We're a fairly strait laced group here. I think you'll fit in just fine.
Oh geez. I wish I'd picked a different top for this interview.
No, I'm tied up until four. How about four thirty?
Siri, play that Houdini YouTube video again.
Maybe it's just me, but I can't seem to get my arms around this concept.
You look like you're crazy enough to work here.
Other than this crazy dress code, it's a great place to work.
On the plus side, I think I've lost 5 lbs.
According to Wikipedia, we both can't be submissive.
Our mental health benefits have been temporarily suspended.
The previous employee found this position too constraining.
Yes, but we can still lean in.
You can speak freely around here, but I admire your restraint.
I sense you realize the importance of being wrapped up in your work.
I'm suggesting we drop straightjacket Monday's and bring back casual Friday's.
This is the part of the interview that tends to trigger the most lawsuits.
I think you'd be a great fit here.
At orientation we'll also need your belt and shoelaces.
I'd really like to help you, but my hands are tied.
I appreciate that. Most people here at the office don't view me as a role model.
HR? Very nice. Mine's from Compliance.
You appear to have all the qualifications for a cabinet position
Congratulations on your acceptance, and welcome to Houdini University.
On top of everything else, I got my panties in a twist.
I think I preferred Casual Fridays.
We're looking for someone who can think outside the jacket.
I much preferred dress-down Fridays to lock-down Fridays, too.
You're in luck-we're looking for straight-laced people.
"The most difficult part of this job is getting dressed in the morning".
I use mine to keep from hitting reply all
How can I help you?
I see a lot of myself in you.
Not only have I lost 20 pounds but I've become more verbally articulate.
First one out buys dinner.
This no tweeting policy is a bit strict.
I love your jacket. Where'd you get it?
I hate this new quit smoking thing the company introduced.
Yes, sexual harassment claims are down. However....
I'm tied up all week too.
Me? They said show restraint. And you?
The company has instituted some highly effective anti-harassment policies.
I understand you're seeking asylum, too.
So you're saying you feel restrained in your current position?
I'll be honest with you. I'm not too sure how to get out of this either...
Finally - a therapist who understands me.
At Houdini Corp., no one can escape Casual Friday.
I know, right? But we've been able to reduce Carpal Tunnel cases by 80%.
I'm free at three.
...and what makes you a good fit for Houdini Industries?
Our corporate philosophy is, keep doing the same thing over and over, until we get different results.
Maybe we should rethink Straightjacket Fridays.
Turns out the glass ceiling was only the first hurdle.
And you can still do 100 words a minute? Really?
Couldn't HR just have asked us to stop dating?
I'm tied up all day today and tomorrow. Are you free any time Thursday?
I know we've both been crazy busy..."
That's when we bought out management, so now the inmates run the asylum.
Welcome. As you can see, our industry is highly regulated.
You remind me of a young me.
You're right, nose typing is a bitch.
You'll find we're not much for body language.
After lunch, my assistant will drop by to hit the ESC key.
The mental health benefits offered here are world-class.
It's crazy how much work I can get done when I can't check my phone.
If the glass ceiling wasn't enough
I think we’ve really succeeded in creating a safe space.
I see from your resume that you are familiar with this jobs constraints
Any experience running an asylum?
Welcome to magician school.
May I ask why you were referred to me?
Does this straight-jacket make me look fat?
I told them we're tied up in a meeting.
It's part of Trump's new groping policy.
So, tell me why you think you'd fit in with our company.
Can you type with your nose?
I see you have many qualifications, but can you type?
I'm still not sure this was the best way to stop all the finger pointing around here.
Does the mail guy still ask you to sign for stuff?
You seem to understand our culture
In exchange for casual Fridays, the boss made us agree to straight jacket Mondays.
Well, I don't think I care much for your body language either.
I liked the job better when they just let us rant and slap the crap out of each other.
There's no retirement plan; HR just removes the jacket when you're ready.
Tell me about a time when you struggled with a particularly difficult garment
Some say the dress code is too restrictive, but I've come to like it.
So, yeah, you'd have to be crazy to take over this job.
Handcuffs are fine on Casual Fridays.
OK it's a deal. If you'll scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.
Let's reschedule for a time when we're both freer.
Do you do your own hair?
You must be from the help desk.
But on casual Fridays, jackets aren't required.
And with the meds, productivity goes way up.
I'm sorry, but I'm looking for a typist.
I guess they are serious about us learning to use Siri?
Do you think the dress code is too restrictive?
We at Tech Tech believe that physical constraints encourage creativity. Raise your hand if you agree.
This binding arbitration makes it impossible to get anything done!
Like a lot of therapists, I got into it to work on my own issues.
It's an insane place to work-you'll love it!
Sometimes it gets nuts around here...you'll fit right in.
I wish I could help you, Jill, but my hands are tied.
When I first came this place was bedlam.
I'd help you out, but my hands are tied.
The new dress code is a bit restrictive.
First question , do you feel comfortable with the constraints this company puts on its' employees?
You're hired! Welcome to the Trump administration.
You realize this position means you'll be tied up at work a lot?
I thought this would be the safest way to discuss our mutual interest in Tom.
On the upside, Siri and I have become really close.
Tell me about a challenge that you overcame at work or school.
Management is strictly hands off here.
I can't wait until Thorazine Thursday.
Casual fridays are a big perk around here.
In the service of full disclosure, we like to give applicants a sense of what it feels like to work here.
Yes, insane is the new black.
You're right. This social media detox is brutal.
This company adheres to a very strict hands off policy.
You understand that we have a binding agreement?
I like an employee that shows a lot of restraint
Well, let me first begin by telling you that our ”Kleptomania” program has a 100 percent success rate!
Please tell me you left the door unlocked.
I'm flattered by your remarkable restraint, Miss Simpson, but I'm afraid my hands are tied.
Can you start tomorrow? We're really in a bind here.
The new dress code is a bit restrictive, but it cuts down on sexual harassment lawsuits.
Is that your phone or mine?
Welcome to the transition team. I see you already have a uniform.
I see you got your promotion. Congratulations and welcome to management!
I also felt that way at first. Eventually you see it as a different kind of freedom.
You'd have to be crazy NOT to work here.
Am I crazy or is the best interview ever?
How about "Rock, Paper, Chins?"
Quit kicking the desk !
It's Houdini Fridays.
Working at EPA under Mr. Trump is going to be so much fun. I see you got your new uniform from his transition team.
Sure they're uncomfortable, but they've really cut down on sexual harassment lawsuits.
Siri, search "Houdini."
Yes, the EPA is different under a Trump administration.
We'd like to give you a raise, but our hands are tied.
A raise? Sorry my hands are tied.
It does work--I've lost 5 pounds already.
As you might surmise,we are not a very hands on company.
And after our last sexual harassment case was settled, we implemented a few changes.
You did well on the personality test, but how are your typing skills?
You will report to our boss, Mr. Houdini.
It's the hottest women's fashion in the Make America Great campaign.
You're bound to be a perfect fit for our company.
No, you don't have to be. But it helps.
What's your restraining order for?
Finally! A foolproof way for us to stop wasting time on the Internet.
We run a very hands-off operation.
I wish I could help, but my hands are tied.
I must be crazy but...you're hired.
Is this the only way to quit social media?
If you complete the application for the Harry Houdini Fan Club in two minutes you're in.
Between you and me, I find the dress code a bit restrictive.
I'd love to hire you but my hands are...well, you know.
Well, I think that about wraps up the interview
Welcome to the White House
It looks like we are both tied up. Let's reschedule next week.
Why do you think you would be a good fit in our company?
Even by our standards you're wound a little too tight, Marcy.
It's always crazy around here during the holidays.
My itch is right in the middle of my back. Where's yours?
Let's call it the Houdini Diet.
Seriously? You really don’t think women are given the same opportunity here as men?
I'm tied up all week too.
Can you recall a time you overcame adversity? Right now doesn't count.
Of course, the one day I didn't bring my handsfree device.
And I think you'll be a perfect fit for our hands-off style of management.
No, YOU google Houdini.
I hate these no-texting Tuesdays too.
You can be strait with me.
Yes, the inmates are now running the asylum.
Hey Siri, pencil her in for the 12th.
So, now you know why we use voice recognition software.
Let's ask Siri.
They did say you had to be crazy to work here.
I may be crazy, but I think we discovered the cure for compulsive texting.
And what makes you think you'd be perfect for this job?
Has your day been as crazy as mine?
Think of it as a self hug.
Welcome to Kleptomaniacs Anonymous.
I personally find this job is a bit confining...
Call me crazy but I like your style!
Glass ceiling? What about the damn straight jackets?
It's more than a metaphor, it's a dress code here at Houdini, Inc.
So, what makes you think you'd be a good fit for our company?
Tell them we're tied up for the foreseeable future.
The job is yours if you can scratch my nose.
When I look at you, Janice, I'm reminded of a younger me.
As you may be aware, my management style is strictly hands-off.
Sounds like another crazy idea - tell me more.
I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to let you go
If you can get out of the straight jacket before me, the job is yours.
Your just the type of employee we were looking for.
You seem very straight-laced. I like that!
A glass ceiling is the least of our problems.
Before we finalize your performance review, I need to understand whether you are enthusiastically embracing or sarcastically mocking the new corporate dress code.
Let's put our heads together and see if the three of us can't think of a solution.
I'd love to move forward with your proposal, but my hands are tied.
These new Anti Groping Policy has interfered with my productivity.
I know it's uncomfortable but it's part of that new law Republicans passed to keep women and minorities from voting.
I see you're feeling the same way about the election as I am.
we've both been so tied up.. we finally have a chance to meet face to face.
I don't know about you, Barb, but while I still crave the nicotine, I don't have to worry about what to do with my hands.
The good news is the new uniform policy has reduced harassment claims...
Looks to me that you are bound to get this job.
We try to take a hands off approach around here.
We rarely see a job applicant so much in tune with our company's values.
I want to be straight with you Jackie.
Who are you wearing?
I lost 7 lbs last week and it beats eating Kale
I guess it's one way of keeping us off our cellphones.
And of course, there's casual fridays.
My nose itches.
You seem to be a great fit for our company.
I think this new diet is going to work great for both of us
I prefer a hands-off approach, too.
I know we've had our differences, but things will improve now that we are showing some restraint.
You seem like a good fit.
So, we start each new hire with our disorientation program.
Honestly, I prefer casual Friday.
Crazy week, right?
These new computer security measures are crazy.
It gets a little crazy around here, but I see from your resume' that you have previous experience with that.
Together, we can make the asylum great again.
Are you tied up for lunch?
Next time I'm going to ask for the gay jacket.
I preferred it when they used mediators.
Ok, I get it - no more 'reply all'
I love your outfit.
You're hired. Enjoy your padded cubicle.
They say I'm the perfect editor.
I see you have experience in a high stress environment.
I'm sorry, but my hands are tied.
Where do you see yourself in five years?
So why are you qualified to be one of the inmates running the asylum?
Another year, another manager returning from a team-building seminar.
I can't wait for casual friday
Look, I'm not crazy about it either.
As you know, my door is always open.
When I said the job offered flexibility, I meant the hours.
Yes, it's a very safe work environment..
It's frustrating but our hands are tied.
Madam Secretary! This is not what I meant by "arms control."
How did you ever get your hair to look so great?
Are you really that empathetic, Dr., or am I just projecting?
I'm sorry, but we're only seeking candidates who recently swallowed a key.
Wow. The inmates really do run the asylum.
You guessed it, the inmates do run the asylum.
I can see you're tied up too, so can we reschedule for tomorrow?
Where do I see myself in five years? Hopefully, wearing your straight jacket."
I would like to help but our hands are tied.
These are not required on casual Fridays.
This is a special program for two-time text offenders.
I'm not crazy about the new dress code.
Wish I could help you but my hands are tied.
I feel bound to advise you that the position can sometimes be very uncomfortable.
Love the shoes!
I'm afraid my hands are tied in this matter.
Honestly, I love working here… but the dress-code sucks!
It's not unusual to get tied up at the office
No, I'm so sorry. I can't validate your parking.
We use restraint here.
My husband doesn't take me seriously when I tell him I'm tied up at work.
I was normal until I woke up on November 9. You?
So, who does your hair?
We could file a complaint with Human Resources but their hands are tied too.
I never interpreted binding arbitration literally
So much for freedom of the press
Yes I think you'll fit in here quite well.
I love your jacket. I got mine at Loony Bin's.
Your resume is impressive. What else do you think qualifies you to work at the Apex Fruit Cake Company?
You'll love "bring your imaginary friend to work" day.
Tell me why you think you are suitable for a position with our organization
Tell me why you'd like to enroll here at The Houdini School.
Turns out, you do have to be crazy to work here. But it doesn't help.
I'm thinking about leaving too. There's just no job mobility here.
The mental health days aren't working.
How shall we submit our winning caption?
Finally, we are actually running the asylum.
Well first let me welcome you to the Harry Houdini school for performing arts.
We're not into touchy-feely here.
Your willingness to keep things under wraps makes you seem like a good fit.
And if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.
Alright, then. Your experience looks good. Your references are great. Let's talk about your commitment.
I've called you in here because I need to do a Ctrl-Alt-Del.
Before we offer you a job at the EPA, we want to make sure you understand the culture.
What makes you think you're qualified to work for the Trump administration?
With your help we can make this the best inmate run asylum in the nation.
In what asylum do you see yourself in 5 years?
We have resorted to binding arbitration
I can see you and I think a lot alike.
One of your coworkers has informed me you had a moment of sanity.
Riverdance girls fit right in.
How many words per minute can you peck?
Well, at least the company has started hiring more women.
We've found it the most effective way to discourage clawing your way to the top.
OK at this point in the interview I'm going to need you to dislocate your shoulder.
Outside of nail biting, any other bad habits?
I see a lot of my younger self in you--bound and determined to succeed.
We offer a competitive benefits package and your own padded cubicle.
What attracted you to our company?
I have to pee.
Yes it's true. The inmates are running the asylum.
I see you are qualified. You have to be crazy to work here.
Looks like you're a perfect fit for our organization
When I said that I get tied up in meetings, I wasn't being figurative.
What do you mean "You don't have to be crazy to work here?"
I think we can find a place for you here.
Okay...that's a wrap!
Management has found far less looting of supplies this way.
We got off easy. The guys are in a shark tank!
I got mine at the outlet store and saved 40%.
150 words per minute, that's impressive !
I know you're tied up, but I'm in a real bind.
So, what makes you think you would fit within this organization?
Where do you see yourself in five minutes?
Perhaps you'd be interested in joining our soccer team.
We're making America sane again.
I started out in your chair.
HR is not so high on escape clauses.
Tell me about a time when you faced adversity.
This way the nicotine patch doesn't fall off.
I wasn't sure what shoes went with it.
We don't publicize the thirteenth step.
Ironically, I'm much more productive these days.
Welcome To Voice Activated Inc.
What leads to your interest in Houdini Enterprises?
They really want you to feel the metaphors here.
What makes you qualified to work in the Trump Administration?
Let's switch seats again!
Yes, we are a closely held company. Why do you ask?
I understand your last position was upside down in a tank of water.
I would keep you on if I could, but our hands are tied
What makes you think that the inmates are running the asylum?
Relax. We are merely removing body language cues out of the interview.
Welcome to the asylum. Do you want to run the place, or just run around the place?
If you are more interested in stocks than bonds, you should have told us that when we hired you.
Where do you see yourself in five years at Houdini, Inc.?
This an all holds barred interview.
We need a more flexible dress code!
It looks like you'll fit in very well with the new direction here at the EPA.
So how's your diet going?
According to my calendar, we'll be tied up for the next hour.
I know you are but what am I
Siri! Please contact Houdini!
We do, however, observe Casual Fridays.
My nose itches.
I think you'll fit in just fine here.
I'm really hoping to let loose at the Christmas party
So...where would you like to be in five years?
You won't be issued keys. All the doors lock from the outside.
Surely you can understand my position...I'd like to help you but my hands are tied.
This is a very stressful position but you may be the perfect candidate to fill it...
It's a temporary precaution until the glass ceiling is repaired.
It's just four years
If you scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours.
Apparently we were getting a little too close to the glass ceiling...
E.P.A. Orientation, 1/20/17.
Here at the Houdini School we take an unorthodox approach to interviews.
We were hoping you could lend us a hand.

I would love to help you but my hands are tied.
I'd really like to, but my hands are tied.
Thank you for interviewing with the Department of Energy.
J. C. Penney. Twenty-five bucks! Where'd you get yours?
I've got the perfect job for you on our government transition team.
This might seem crazy but you might be just what we need.
These team-building exercises never end well.
Do you ever get an itch?
The designer told me it was an original .
Where do you see your selves in five years?
Armani?
How do you think you would fit in the President-elect's administration?
On the flip side, use of social media during work hours is at an all time low.
Now that we're no longer looking at our phones, what was it that you wanted to meet about?
Mr. Trump is pleased to offer you the position of Under Secretary of Mental Health Services. Congratulations.
... I guess we have to stay for the office Christmas party.
Any more loose ends that need tieing up?
I'm sorry I slapped you, too.
You're fine, thank you. How am I?
Mine itches. Yours?
You'd have to be crazy NOT to work here.
I like your style. Very straight-laced.
Did you take my hands-free headset?
This comes right before 'final written warning.'
Actually, we've been running the asylum since November 8th.
Welcome to your interview at The Houdini Institute. One, two, three – go!
Siri gets a real workout.
The Department Chair assures me that the new academic restraints are only temporary,
I miss our old padded expense accounts.
So, it's a wrap, then?
Are you quitting Facebook too?
It shouldn't take long for you to fit in.
You seem ideal for our "hands-off" management style.
Me? A magic act gone bad. You?
It's a Zen thing. Restrict the body, free the mind.
The best thing about working here is you don't have to wash your hands after using the restroom.
Sanity is not a requisite for employment here.
Call me crazy, but I think your resume is a perfect match!
I see you're on a social media break too.
The HR Dept. found that body language creates confusion, so it's not allowed
How did you you hear about Houdini Enterprises?
I hate getting tied up in meetings.
You'll fit right in with our corporate culture.
If you can get out of the straight-jacket faster than I can, you're hired.
I would love to give you a raise but like you my hands are tied.
For us, it's not just a saying. We literally run the place.
I still think this is the best way to kick the social media habit
I've been tied up in meetings all day.
...so, why do you think you're a fit for our company culture?
The work environment here is really insane.
Our last corporate culture was too hands-on.
A word to the wise... try not to drink too much coffee.
You're just the fit we've been looking for.
Now that we can't pick-up our iPhones, we can actually get some work done.
It's a glass ceiling thing.
At least I'm at low risk for carpal tunnel syndrome.
They're still better than the Nehru jackets.
I always say you should dress for the job you want.
Are you tied up next week?
So, I guess you're not allowed on the internet during lunch either.
We're looking for someone who can operate under certain constraints.
One of us is going to have to change.
i think they're calling it a gender neutral jacket now
It's effective though. Haven't checked my phone in hours.
Since the election, we've found this the best way to keep from breaking furniture.
So, what interests you about working in the Trump White House?
Here we don't climb the corporate ladder so much as hop.
You appear to be overqualified for this position.
You don't have to be nuts to work here, but it helps!
Yes, sometimes I find this work a little restrictive.
We are bound to like each other.
You know, I could tell straight-away that you were perfect for this place.
Well, that about wraps it up.
No one said this job was going to be easy.
Why can't they just restrain our middle fingers?
We've found this to be the most effective approach to prevent checking mobile devices during meetings.
HR says it is already reducing sexual harassment claims.
No, I don't think that, 'You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours,' would work here.
So, why are you interested in a position with The New Yorker?
So what can't I help you with?
Permission to speak freely.
That's actually not the craziest thing I've ever heard.
We are an equal opportunity employer.
I understand but my hands are tied too.
One of us should take notes.
Uh oh, number one or number two?
Regardless of my breakdown, your session will still be billed.
I see you've heard about our dress code.
You look like a perfect fit for this job.
It's normal. I've been on the program for a year and still have urges to check my Facebook page at work.
Designing voice recognition software, fortunately.
Yes, this is a patient-run mental hospital. Welcome!
No, you don't have to be. But it helps.
They've replaced the glass ceiling with a padded one.
I'm beginning to think the red tape wasn't so bad after all.
I'm 100% committed to this project. You?
Despite having the most committed employees, productivity was still surprisingly low.
We've never been accused of lack of restraint.
Look, I'd love to help you, but my hands are tied.
You seem overqualified.
You're hired. I can't put my finger on it, but I believe you're going to be a perfect fit with my company.
We're all very much committed here to the firm.
If I scratch your back, would you scratch mine?
Running the asylum isn't as easy as it looks.
What anti-psychotic do you see yourself on in 5 years?
I see something in you that makes me think you will be a great fit for this company.
If you can get loose, and get me loose, you're hired.
I miss casual Fridays.
I know that my decision to have you succeed me may come as a surprise.
We run a hands off approach here.
...and where do you see yourselves in five years.
You don't have to be crazy to work here.
It's a wrap.
Let's make this quick. Looks like we're both strapped for time.
Strangely, productivity has increased.
At least we're not tongue tied.
This new dress code is driving me crazy.
I'd love to go, but I'm all tied up.
I mean, it's not like we tweet any more than the President elect.
I would love to help you but as you can see, my hands are tied.
I'm not so sure your problem is that unique.
We focus on prevention here at Crotch Grabbers Anonymous.
I'll file your complaint about the dress code as soon as I have a free hand.
Maybe Siri can help us out.
I see you are familiar with the constraints of working for this administration.
Let's get straight to the point. This job is a little confining.
You don't have to be crazy to work here it helps.
You have to use your head to be successful in here.
It worked for my other addictions.
I'm really looking for someone who can roll up their sleeves and be more hands-on.
Remember when the barriers were invisible?
I think this job would be a good fit for you.
As you already know, we have a very strict dress code.
On the bright side, ours are only 79.6% as tight as the men's jackets.
Welcome to Academia.
At least no one can read our body language.
Well, I guess, that ties up all the loose ends.
That makes two of us.
This weight loss program is really working. I'm down 10 pounds.
Around here we believe body language is a distraction.
You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.
Kleptomania is a disease, but I'm living proof our treatment works wonders.
They keep us from checking Facebook.

You'd have to be crazy not to take this job.
I think you'll find the restrictions here very liberating. I, for one, haven't so much as lifted a finger in ages.

I prefer red tape. What about you?
Yo've got to be nuts to work here
Can you scratch my nose with your nose ?
Yes, I am in charge of this asylum.
And we also have an aggressive retention incentive plan.
These new business regulations seem very restrictive.
I run this company, but like you I started as just a threat to myself and others.
But we do have Casual Fridays...
Right now I would settle for mobility, never mind upward mobility.
You'll fit right in - we're a pretty tight-knit company.
Let's meet next Tuesday at 9:00. I guess we'll just have to remember that.
Well, I think we've about wrapped up this interview.
I'm sorry, I'm afraid our hands are tied.
I remember when we used to complain about our golden handcuffs.
What first made you interested in working at the E.P.A.?
You'll fit right into our corporate culture.
We're looking for someone with more hands on experience.
I wish they came in black, white makes me look fat.
We're not so much hands on here.

I'm sorry; did you want to take notes?
What do you consider to be the major constraints of the job, and how do you plan to free yourself of those constraints?
I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do. My hands are tied.
Is that your phone ringing?
I kind of miss the glass ceiling.
Are you making fun of me?
I like your style.
Well, that about wraps it up.
I'll be tied up all afternoon. Will you be free tomorrow?
Lunatics now running the asylum - check! Next step - elect Donald Trump president!
You scratch my nose, I'll scratch yours.
Nail biter. You?
And we thought the problem was the glass ceiling.
Once we get past this, the glass ceilings are easy.
So, where did you hear about our company?
We'll be covering the new administration.
Your resume is great and all, but if you can figure out how to scratch my nose, you're hired.
I think you will fit in well here at Houdini Enterprises.
We gotta be crazy to work here.
This intervention for keeping us off Facebook seems to be working so far.
I don't need to tell you, my hands are tied.
Nice ties. Who did them?
I think it's time we start running this asylum.
I see that you've learned to show some restraint...
OK, so it started with one of those signs which said 'You don't have to be mad to work here, but it helps'…
I think you will fit in here.
I was promised butterfly wings. You?
I think our hands are tied on this one.
I'd really like to help, but my hands are tied.

I see you’ve had no hands-on experience. You’re hired!
I think this interview is about wrapped up,
At least they don't make us wear nylons.
We prefer the term "user-based management model", but in answer to your question, yes, this asylum is run by the inmates.
They told ME it was an original!
Since we're tied up this week, why don't we try to meet next week
So what do you think of straight jacket Thursday?
Do you ever get the itch to do something crazy?
We started running the place last week.
I agree. It's so annoying they only come in white.
This is the only foolproof method to not text back.
I think it goes without saying that we don't offer flex-time here.
I'll just tell them that we'll be tied up for the next few days.
I think we are in a real bind.
Our dress code is binding
I miss the golden handcuffs.
I'm itching to get out of here.
Do I even need to ask about how many words per minute you can type?
Yes, the new policy on sexual harassment is a bit restrictive.
Just tell him no, our hands are tied.
It's refreshing to meet another strait shooter.

Let's just be strait with each other.
We want to hire someone with absolutely no imagination at all.
Last time I tie one on at the office party.
Are you mocking me?
We appreciate your interest, but I'm afraid you're overqualified.
At least our tongues aren’t tied.
Please tell us a little about yourself and why you think you're a good fit for this institution.
Your resume was intriguing
I will never ask you to do anything I wouldn't do myself.
If you'll scratch my nose I'll scratch yours.
You'll find that we frown on multitasking.
I'll admit I am not crazy about these new binding contracts

It keeps me from tweeting.
Luckily for you, you have to be crazy to work here.
We find this is the best way to avoid checking your Facebook account during work hours.
Believe me, I understand where you're coming from.

Do you think he's coming back?
I think it's time for a more hands-on approach.

Can I be straight with you?
Would you agree we're in dire straits?
How many pounds have you lost so far?
This happened because once again you misused ‘literally.’
They told me it was a one of a kind Armani.
This is the part of the interview that gauges your ability to work with others.

Our managerial style here is pretty hands-off...I'm assuming your comfortable with that?
Thanks for applying. You're just what we're looking for!

Well SOMEBODY clicked "Reply All"!

You'd have to be crazy not to hire me.
To wrap up, the contract's binding.
Sorry, I can't give you a raise. I understand that you're strapped, but so am I.
This is embarrassing. We can't both wear the same thing to the holiday party!
Welcome to the Houdini Corporation.
You'll get used to the dress code, and you'll just love the padded offices!
I don't favor a hands-on approach

We're both tied up at the moment, is there a better time to meet?
In fairness, the terms and conditions update did warn of a new binding arbitration clause.

So I guess our idea to reduce CEO pay was not well received.

Looks like I'm tied up until next week at the earliest...and you?
I can't make the meeting, but I'll try to butt-dial in.

I work well in a restrained environment.
I meant we’re crazy in a good way.
I'll give it to you strait: I'd like to hire you but my hands are tied.
Think I'd look better in a size nine?
Corporate's really pushing this whole 'hands-free' thing, aren't they?
You figure out a way to tweet and you can have my job.
I'd really prefer to have a more "hands-on" type of role.
Why do I get all the crazy ones?
... and we've been running this asylum every since.
I'm not crazy about your idea.
Should we have a safe word?
We've been running the place since Tuesday.
Some of us can't get used to using the "hands-free" devices, so we're trying something new.
And the best thing about working here is that our medical plan includes psychiatric coverage.
Yes, I am the leading expert in counseling people who have Houdini Syndrome.
I can't talk now, I'm on a psychotic break.
Hey Siri...
To move up in this company, you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours.
It's my pleasure to welcome you to the Houdini School of Magic.
I still prefer this over "business casual".
I'd love to help, but my hands are tied.
It's nuts around here.
Describe a time when a former supervisor declared you insane.
So, do you like the company’s new “Hands Off Policy”?
Have you ever worked on a political campaign before?
This is why we never get anything done around here.
Google Houdini
HR said we couldn't get out of it.
Of course, you must be able to type with a pencil in your mouth.
Was that Riverdance New York or Riverdance London?
Yes, it is going to be a long four years.
Ever since Hilary lost, things have gotten worse for us women in the work force.
I'd have to be crazy to hire you.
Actually, this was not my worst Take Your Child to Work Day.
We do expect a high level of commitment.
Hopefully you're not Italian
I understand your prior therapist had a very different approach
Does this new employee bonding technique feel weird to you too?
If you can type with your feet and eat from the employee cafeteria trough you're hired.
Could you pass the scissors, please?
I'd love to give you a raise, but things are really tight here just now.
Finally, we're in charge of the asylum.
Work's been driving me crazy too.
It's actually worse than the glass ceiling.
How to succeed in business, Rule #1: Be prepared for your interview, Rule #2: Emulate your supervisor, Rule #3: Show restraint.
And, are you comfortable working in somewhat confining conditions
Our ban on social media use during work hours has been 100% successful! Now, your job is to increase productivity.
You will fit right in.
You're right, I don't miss my phone either.
And there's a glass ceiling, too.
What makes you think you're qualified to work for Mr. Trump?
These meetings drive me crazy
Well, one of us needs to go get help.
We could have tried to resolve our differences over coffee before getting HR involved?
I'm looking for an opportunity to spread my wings.
He's my favorite designer too! Did you buy the matching shackles too?
That color looks great on you.
I'm confident we have a place for you in our administration.
Can you give me an example of what you mean when you say your opportunities for advancement are being limited?
I'd help you, but my hands are tied.
Look, my hands are tied too.
Give it to me strait, doctor.
Mr. Trump likes your style. There's a place for you in his Administration.
This place just isn't a good fit for me anymore.
I really think that we're bound to work well together.
So it says here you have some prior experience...?
I see we have some things in common. You're hired!
There's not much wiggle room on the hours.
We take a hands-off approach at this company.
Now would be a good time to air our grievances.
There seems to be a concern that the inmates are running the asylum.
Yes, it is the reason we have an open door policy.
Well that's the last time we ask if our company plan has mental health benefits
I'd love to help, but I'm also tied up all afternoon.
I have a tendency to become too wrapped up in my job.
Well, I think that just about wraps things up.
It's Legal's way of keeping us off twitter.
The election got to you, too?
In our experience, self control isn't enough.
You know, we shouldn't have complained so much about the golden handcuffs.
It goes without saying that you'll need to wear slip-ons.
I totally sympathize with your dilemma, but my hands are tied.
I'd love to help you Mrs. Johnson, but my hands are tied.
It's not an interrogation, it's an enhanced interview.
Okay, but wouldn't you agree the glass ceiling was a more comfortable metaphor?
The Company has a strict policy on the use of cell phones.
I think you will fit in fine here.
Things can get a bit insane around here, which is why we think you'll be a perfect fit.
Don't point your toe at me like that.
I think we need to improve our outreach.
Let's not do anything crazy.
I think I understand your position.
You'll fit well with our corporate culture.
My back pain is gone and my hands are never cold. You'll love it.
Hey Siri, begin interview!
Okay, let's see if this puppy has a hands-free ap.
Let's get something strait. There will be no finger pointing in this office.
You can't just not do your job because your nose itches.
If you're born Italian, I find it helps in learning to speak English.
They take compliance very seriously around here.
No, it's not a very touchy feely department
I'm sorry, but I just can't sign off on this.
This way, we don't have to block Facebook and Twitter on work computers.
I'm sorry, you're overqualified.
We're tied up in meetings all day.
OK, then. We're ready for 2017.
I'm sorry, but we have to let you go.
You're right, Tina, it's not that uncomfortable. And it makes tweeting virtually impossible. Think he'll go for it?
It can get a little crazy around here. I hope you're okay with that.
well, one of us needs to send the email.
You remind me of myself when I was your age.
I really AM feeling less need to gesticulate.
As you know, a career in voice recognition software isn't for everyone.
Call me crazy, but I think you'd be a perfect fit for our company.
Of course I'd like to do the right thing, but our hands are tied.
We're just wrapping up here.
I try to identify with my clients.
You should have read the employment ad more carefully, we're looking for someone with 'hands-on' experience.
Let me also ask, what are your manipulative skills?
I'd love to be able to help you with the problem, but my hands are tied.
Unwanted touching was a problem.
I just keep telling myself this will all be over in four years...
I love it! Who are you wearing?
I see we have something in common.
The dress code is just crazy here
" I was really impressed with your resume'. I've got to hand it to you...oops! Gotta stop saying that
I think we can negotiate without killing each other.
When I started working for Mitt, I had no idea what he meant by binders of women.
I guess we won't be climbing the corporate ladder!
This job does not require much manual dexterity.
I'd like to offer you the position. It's obvious you'll fit right in with our new administration.
Cost cutting. We eliminated padded cubicles.
And how well, would you say, do you work under pressure?
Who are you wearing?
Now it's safe to talk. You first.
We're bound to make this a better workplace.
I'm sorry. I would love to help you, but my hands are tied.
I would love to give you a raise but, you know as well as I, my hands are tied.
Only Siri can save us now.
You appear to be overqualified.
I'm sensing a very hostile work environment.
Well, we did vote for change
There will be times when you'd die for a cup of coffee but that will pass.
If you think these HUD ones are tight you should try the ones at the EPA!
Total freedom is elusive.
In some states we can vote!
I'd like to help, but so are mine.
You must be crazy to work here.
We're both crazy busy so let's keep this short.
Just having a "no tweeting" rule wasn't working for the administration
Ready......set......GO!
Where's Siri when you need her?
If you escape before me you'll move on to the levitation interview.
Loosen up??
They told me I was crazy voting for Trump. What's your story?
Exactly what makes you qualified to work here!
Our policies are fully compliant with both Sharia law and Trump administration free speech guidelines.
Well, I guess that's a wrap!
Let's get something straight.
Have you noticed we're just not as productive as we used to be.
You’d fit right in here.
I guess thats the end of Facebook during work hours.
Dress for the job you want, not the job you have.
I’m beginning to regret advocating mental health coverage.
You are exactly what this company is looking for!
Personnel says we have to keep our hands to ourselves.
They did warn us about stricter policies if we continued to use social media on company time.
Welcome to your first day at Anger Management School, I am a former graduate.
We're hoping the new manager will be less stringent.
And as an added bonus, the walls of your office will be lined with rubber.
Your resume and everything you've told me confirms that you're quite useless. You'll fit in perfectly here.
So we're all straight then?
Your outrageous claims and volatile unpredictability are exactly what we need. When can you start?
Besides the discriminating dress code for schizophrenics, how do you like your job so far?
Right--hands on experience is not required.
So I'd like to help, but my hands are tied.
It's great to meet an applicant who's such a good fit--shall we shake on it?
Welcome to Peer to Peer counseling.
I'd love to fund your project, but frankly I'm pretty strapped myself.

The nice thing about uniforms is you don't have to worry about what you'll wear tomorrow.

I'm also in a bind.
It was a pleasure meeting you, Shannon. We're always looking for like-binded individuals. I really think you will be a good fit.

Cancel all calls. We're tied up at the moment
I understand you're in dire straits, but my hands are tied.

While it's good for our posture, it creates havoc in the ladies room.
I don't know how I feel about HR's new social media use policy.
Command, Opt, Escape. I'll try my nose this time.
I couldn't do a thing about it; my hands are tied.
I hope you'll accept our job offer. I think you're a perfect fit for our corporate culture.
When I said you should try putting yourself in my place I didn’t think you would take me literally.
Let me get this straight...
Lesson learned: don't call it the 'Christmas' party.
I need someone with more of a "hands-on" approach.
This is a difficult for us both.
Not only do we take things very literally here, we also have a very hands off approach to management.
With our new management, we plan to use a more hands-on approach.
I'd really like to help you get out, but my hands are tied.

Unfortunately, our productivity has dropped dramatically since we adopted our 'Safety First & Foremost' policy.
No problem, all our systems are voice activated.

Welcome aboard. You'll fit right in.
Disturbing, yes, but let's give the new guy a chance.
Siri, call 911.
What can you bring from voice recognition to driverless technology?

Running the asylum is much harder than I expected.
I can't help you. My hands are tied.

We seem to have so much in common.

Interesting that we both love Patsy Cline.
You blinked.
And yes, we are fully bonded and insured.
Here at HR we understand the stresses you experience at our company.
You'll fit in well here; this place is an insane asylum.
Me too. It's not that I don't think about it. I just don't do it any more.

The holidays can be tough for all of us.
Your move.
Like you, i'm all tied up
Okay, give it to me straight
I heard that you're welcoming new clients with open arms.
This is a hands-free workplace.
This latest diet craze sucks.
Well, yes, our company does seem to frown on leaning-in.
I felt my last job was too constricting.
This prevents us from checking our phones during the interview.
I love casual Fridays, don't you?
I think we're both having trouble opening up.
I'm glad to see you're staying committed.
I thought management said that they were going to "re-train" us.
Yes, but there is no glass ceiling.
You'll love working here--the men control everything.
Is this how driverless cars got started?

Great question! Yes, I can definitely say that the inmates run the asylum.

Hands-free is out. Arms-free is the next big thing.
Definitely no texting during this meeting.
So, you're OK with our no tweet policy? Now, can you type with your nose?
Welcome to the Dept. of Education.
Did they say you talk with your hands too much as well?
It's a crazy business but I love it.
Well, one of us is going to have to change.
So, the good news is that management agreed with you that the inmates are running the asylum...
You will be working with many other like-minded people.
So since we are both tied up at the moment, why don't we do lunch Wednesday?
I think we're coping with Trump just fine.
I like where your head's at.
Ready to get lunch? I have two straws.
I was concerned about your qualifications, but now that I get a look at you, there's something I like.
Now, let me be strait with you.
Except for the restraints what else bothered you about the interview?
At least our ceiling is padded.
I'd love to help you out of your predicament Sheila, but my arms are tied...
Well, this is bound to be interesting.
Our cybersecurity team recommended it.
As for dress code, we have a strict hands-off policy.
They're gonna think we're nuts.
How are your nose-typing skills?
I wanted to be someone you could relate to.
This is nothing. You should sit in on a division meeting.
It looks like we are ready to wrap this up.
I should've went to the restroom first.
The way I see it, I'm as qualified as you are for this job.
Welcome to today's kleptomaniac cure therapy session
I'd like to help but my hands are tied on this one
One final question. You do realize you'll be replacing me, yes?
Things have been great, but I'm finding the company dress code a bit confining.
It's been totally insane around here since the election.
I'm sorry, but my hands are tied also.
You'll be helping me write the President Elect's speeches. Best to get a feel for the job.
My hands are tied. You understand, right?
Yeah, it's not about calorie-counting. It's about making it basically impossible to feed yourself.
This is not a hands-on position.
You tell me why you think our sweaters aren't selling.
I think we can market them as adult swaddling blankets.
They only tell you about the glass ceiling part.
And how did you wind up here?
I've booked the board meeting next month in the white padded room.
Okay Google, how to get out of a straightjacket.
Now let's try www.Houdini.com.
I'll scratch your back if you'll scratch mine.
You think this spoils the quality of the exit interview?
I'm sorry, my hands are tied. You know how it is.
Truth is, I am crazy about your numbers, but as far as a promotion, my hands are tied.
We can still lean forward.
How will I know if I'm hired?
Would you be willing to put these claims, in writing?
Some new employees find working here a bit nerve racking, but I have a feeling you'll fit right in.

Your mobile's ringing!
OK, let's start wrapping things up now.
You've heard that working here drives you crazy?!

'I'm thinking of introducing, Jacket-free Fridays.'

We're going to have to start saying no.
I'm sorry, that question is out of bounds.
At least we don't have to worry about hitting "reply all."
We view arms as an appendage that distracts from oral interpretation.
I can see why you might find some of our practices confining.
Our strict dress code leaves no wiggle room for self-expression.
Let me give it to you straight . . .
Crazy, huh? I knew we were bound to be friends.
This seems like severe punishment for surfing the web at work!
Helen, I would love to offer you the position, but the board has chosen another candidate and I'm afraid my hands are tied.
Do you think our restrictive dress code stifles productivity?
Ae you sure there aren't any loose ends?
We were bound to do this, don't you agree?
Sorry we have to let you go, you just aren't committed.
Mirroring the interviewer can be overdone.
Seems a bit archaic to have a conversation without email, texts or emojis.
Now you won't add to the draft and I won't edit. It's a win-win.
I think all three of you would be a good fit for our organization.
We all want raises but, as you can see, our hands are tied.
TGIF
If hired, you're bound to love this job.
I'm sorry, but my hands are tied on this one.
It helps me empathize.
I assume that by now you understand that creativity is not highly valued around here.
It's amazing how many things you can't do without hands!
I'm so glad I can be straight with you.
I'll be straight with you; you got the dress code, you get the job.
It can be so difficult to hear over the din of body language, don't you agree?
I'd offer you a tissue, but I'm having trouble with this damn drawer.
They're never adopted casual Friday here.
I don't want to have this conversation any more than you do.
Welcome to the office of Mike Pence, where you're straight whether you like it or not.

That's insane!
This diet doesn't work in the office.
Swap seats now, doctor?
I'm sorry, Brenda. My hands are tied.
Who’s your tailor?
Casual Fridays are not what they used to be.
I should have never agreed to that psych evaluation.
I'm not mocking you.
This is the job I've been looking for!
We have very little wiggle room. I think a "hands on" approach will work.
We're strait-laced, yes, but I think you'll find we're not a stuffy group.
I think we both know why I can't give you a raise.
I'd love to support your new idea, but my hands are tied.

"Constraints,"I said! "Constraints," not "Restraints."
It's our backlash to Casual Friday.
Well, we've always said you have to be crazy to work here.
Stop projecting.
I'm not crazy about the new dress code.
Where do you see yourself in five years?
If you were a tree, what type of tree would you be?
I'll do whatever I can to help you out.
You'll see we run a tight ship here
And we both know the contract is binding...
I want this office to be a safe space.
President Trump will see you now.
Any asylum takeover has its challenges
Perks for the position include voice-activated office equipment and drinking straws.
Okay, we agree to avoid a 'hands-on' approach.
How was your first day at Micro-Management Corporation?
Mom always said, if you don't have anything nice to tweet, restrain yourself.
You may be right about the new uniforms.
The dress code here is strict, but you'll have no problem fitting in.
Who knew breaking the glass ceiling would get us committed?
You don't have to be crazy to work here, but it helps...with the dress code.
There's nothing we can do - our hands are tied.
We are a straight laced company
You'll like working here...They don't bug you over productivity
Hang in there. The uniform gets switched to strappy bras for spring.
Excellent: you do have to be crazy to work here.
It prevents anyone from clawing their way to the top.
We find it eliminates those annoying "Reply to all" emails.
Could you pass me the pen?
In this job, I'm always tied up one way or another.
Remember, this all started with "casual Fridays"...
At what age did you develop your Houdini fascination ?
This is going to make the fight for Equal Pay even more challenging.
Our company is a local institution.
Yeah, there's not a lot of flexibility here but the pay's good.
Don't also be tongue-tied! Say something.
Well, you know, we have a hands off policy here.
Now that Trump has been elected, I'm so much more calmer
And I don't feel the need to check my phone all the time. I am free now.
Per the President Elect's request, these are the outfits for his Cabinet members.
I understand you're feeling constricted.
Now what do we do?
You have more knots so you go first.
This new dress code policy is insane.
Why yes, I am more relaxed.
If you can beat me out of this jacket, you've got the job...
This is not exactly what I had in mind when I said 'Give it to me straight', Janet.
I'm sorry, but we're going to let you go.
Management doesn't want any handshake deals.
Didn't you hear? Everything in the office is voice activated.
And why do you feel more qualified for an administrative position?
I'm on the waitlist for the pants.
Google Houdini
I'm sorry, you're overqualified.
It renders the glass ceiling superfluous.
Don't blame me--I voted for Her!
We have to be more open with each other
I'm passing on your manuscript, too much of a nail-biter.
I am going to describe a hypothetical challenging situation to you, and you tell me how you would deal with it.
This place is crazy!
We want to be the Uber of straightjackets.
It seems like you'll be a good fit for The White House Ethics office
I think we're getting too close to the glass ceiling.
We went from business casual to business restraining.
This place can drive you crazy sometimes, but it seems you already know that.
Comfortable?
I would like to read our mission statement again. I may have missed something.
Sometimes I find this job to be too constricting.
We will be working on a body control issues today.
Tell me why you think you're qualified to work here.
I feel your pain.
It's a job that you can really wrap your arms around.
What makes you think you are a good hire for Houdini Industries?
You're just not crazy enough to work here.
I'm sorry. I just don't think you'd be a good fit for us.
And what prior experience do you have in running an asylum?
I think our hands are tied on this one.
These new team-building sessions are really making the difference.
You're hired! I see you have what it takes to work here.
So I think we've wrapped things up here, but I don't think I can manage doing lunch today...
Your jacket design has been dropped from Spring 2017. I'm sorry, my hands are tied.
At least we won't get carpal tunnel...
Ever feel like you are in a bind?
Did you still want to know where I see myself in five years?
I apologize for yet another soul-crushing HR team building experience.
I suppose we could have just turned off our cell phones.
I find these performance evaluation rules a bit constraining, don't you?
Now can we have some straight talk?
First one to escape gets the Christmas bonus.
The dress code is conservative, but we get catered meals and a gym membership.
Office bonding is overrated.
I'm glad this project isn't one of those "hands on" tasks.
We used to have just a lot of red tape to deal with, those were the good old days.
That doesn't make sense but I like how you think.
Is it you or is it me?
Okay, I understand that there are a few things we need to straighten out.
Before we test your act in the water tank, we want to be sure you can escape here in thirty seconds.
Feel free to be totally open. This is a safe space.
Couldn't we just have put our devices in a drawer?
Says here you once won honorable mention doing the "Hokey Pokey." Please tell me about that
I don't think we can get our arms around this idea.
I know I look great in this Dianne, but I'm afraid you just can't pull it off.
To be honest, Rita, being a writer for Saturday Night Live just isn't the same since Trump became President Elect.
If we offered you a position, would you be OK with being chained to your desk?
Any chance you'll be free later today? I'm in a real bind and could use your help.
Welcome to Chez Cray-Cray, a pioneer of self-managed asylum living.
As you can see, we’re a pretty straight-laced office.
I'm not crazy, you're just projecting.
So much for the plan that was so crazy it might just work.
