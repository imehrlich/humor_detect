I pictured it differently when you said you kept my room just like it was.
Fine, mom. You've made your point. I'll start looking for an apartment tomorrow.
No, you grow up.
Mom! When you said I could have my old room back, this isn't what I had in mind.
I hate being born on Leap Year.
Hey Mom, when I asked if I can move back into my old room, this wasn't exactly what I had in mind.
Nope, still not ready to finish those peas.
I can hear you, you know.
It's time to get my own crib.
You said I could have my OLD room back...not my FIRST room!
...but I regress.
Yeah, my parents let me move back into my old room."
Mom, this is exactly why I don't come home to visit more often.
I think I overslept.
Of course I could climb out -- but, then what?
I'm pretty sure I'm in the control group.
Alexa. Are my parents ever coming back?
Siri, what's the Guinness World Record for the longest time out?
This is why I don't like coming home over break.
Are you sure this is the only way to stay on your insurance?
You should probably know that I can hear you too.
Naturally, I'm touched that you kept my room exactly as it was when I was kidnapped.
This isn't what I had in mind when I said I wanted to move back home.
I'm starting to regret moving back in with my parents.
Yes, your AirBnB post promised that I'll sleep like a baby, but...
You know I can climb out of here, right?
It's true what they say. You can't go home again.
This is the last time I use Airbnb.
Not what I meant by "getting my own crib". Over.
I'm ready to eat my broccoli now.
No, you grow up.
Mom, Dad, did you forget something?
No child left behind? That's a laugh.
When you said I could move back into my old room I assumed you meant my most recent room, not my OLDEST room.
Mom...Dad...you still alive?
Maybe I shouldn't have moved back after college.
It's time for my bottle. I recommend a dry red if you really want me down for the night.
Honey? The baby's outsmarted me again.
Yes, I've finally calmed down.
This isn't exactly what I had in mind when I asked to move back in with you, mom.
Am I still grounded for life?
Mommy? Daddy? Are you ever coming to get me?
You win Dad. I'll pay rent.
Is anybody there?
I've been on hold so long I gotta change my order to solid foods.
Is it possible to upgrade an Airbnb reservation mid-stay?
Its not a phase mom, its who I am.
When I said I would like to sleep like a baby, this isn't what I had in mind.
Please wait. Your call is important to us,
Mom... Dad... you know I can hear you, too, right?
So, Mom, this isn't really what I had in mind when I said it would be fun to stay in my old room.
Maybe moving back home wasn't such a good idea after all.
Hello, Child Overprotective Services? Help!
Hello?, it's the middle child... remember me?
Yes, I'm still on my parents' family plan.
Wendy, it's Peter, are we still on for tonight?
Can I have the blond babysitter?
Uh, when I said I wanted my own crib...
The good news is, I finished putting it together.
I guess I overslept
Mom, is this really the only way I can keep my health insurance?
This isn't what the Airbnb posting looked like.
OK, OK, I'll pay rent.
Listen Mom, a lot of kids move back home after college...
I'm having doubts about this witness protection identity.
Dumb! I learned my lesson in Juvie.
...and another thing: I want to get vaccinated.
You know I can hear you, right?
Mom, I'm off to college in August whether you like it or not.
Hey mom, I think I overslept.
I'm starting to feel you're not all that happy about me moving back home, Mom.
I love you too, Mom, but at some point you've got to let go.
Moving back in with my parents isn't working.
There are drawbacks to my parents leaving my room exactly the same.
Sleeping like a baby is overrated.
Get a job and move out? What, and leave all this?
Mom, I think I'm finally ready to discuss moving out.
How long was I asleep?
Hour 61,324: still no sign of Tooth Fairy.
Maybe moving back in wasn't the best idea.
I need another bottle. How about a Merlot this time?
OK mom, you win. I'll move out.
Did you forget about me?
Airbnb? Can you connect me with customer service please.
This is why I don't come over more grandma
I knew it was a mistake moving back home at thirty.
I'll fix the wifi when you give me back my Teddy.
This seems like a really long time out, Mom.
Mom...Dad...come quick! I've grown up!
There's got to be an easier way to keep me insured.
Mom, just thought you'd like to know I gave your breast milk 4 stars on Yelp.
Are you ready to hear my first four-letter word?
Mom, I'm staying here until my caption wins the New Yorker competition.
Mom? I overslept.
They say eighteen is the new eighteen months.
When I said 'I'll always be your baby' I was speaking metaphorically.
No, you're the big baby!
Is anybody there?
...in other news, the FDA has approved the use of steroids in baby formula saying there are no discernible side effects...
Now can I stay on your insurance?
Mum? Dad? I think I overslept.
When I said I wanted my own crib, this is not what I had in mind.
The Hotel brochure said "You'll sleep like a baby."
Yes, I was home schooled. Why do you ask?
Can I exchange the timeout for community service?
Mom I'm thirsty, could you bring me a gin and tonic?
Thanks for letting me move back in to my old room.
I've finished thinking about what I've done.
Mom, when I said I wanted my own crib, this isn't what I had in mind.
Nothing dude, just hangin' out in my crib.
I don't think I'm the one who's acting immature in this relationship.
25 is the new 18 months.
Mom, can Lisa sleep over?
You know I can climb out ... Don't you?
How long was my nap?
It's fine, my last airbnb was a tub.
Siri, how do I climb out of a crib?
Wow. I REALLY slept in.
And now they'll let me stay on your healthcare plan?
Olivia, my parents just left. Want to come over and check out my crib?
How long was I out?
How long have I been asleep?
Should I drive the babysitter home?
"Time travel tech support, please".
Hey Mom, don't freak out, but I literally grew up over night.
He's the president? How long was I asleep?
Let me know when Trump's term is up.
I think I've had a growth spurt.
I grew up. Over.
Mom, I had the student loan nightmare again.
Hell-of-a-long timeout, don't ya think?
Just hanging out in my crib. S'up with you?
Maybe me moving back home wasn't such a good idea.
Guys, this has been a pretty long time out.
Thanks for letting me move back in, mom.
No I don't need changing; I need a shave.
My friends get to live in their parents' basements.
Is 'time-out' over yet?
Okay, I get it. You're ready for me to move out.
Longest. Time-out. Ever.
Let's talk about your parenting skills, then we'll talk about bedtime.
I just get the feeling you're not ready for me to grow up...
Mom, how much longer is this timeout?
Note to self: "Grow up!"
Crib Control to Major Mom.
I am not jealous of the new baby.
I guess you really can't go home again.
Dad, are you finished with my new Ikea bed yet?
BECAUSE, Mom! This is the age I identify with.
In the rentals section of the newspaper it said "Cozy, furnished crib with monitoring system included."
By any chance is the baby in bed with you?
Me? Secretary of Education? Sure...why not?
I'm still going away to college in September whether you like it or not.
I'm not being childish. Over.
I gotta get out - just vaccinate me already!
I'm sorry, the baby is out. Can I take a message?
When I said I wanted my own crib this is not what I meant.
Day 28: They still do not suspect the swap.
It's not a ban; it's extreme bedding.
Mom, can Bob from Accounting sleep over this weekend?
You said you would come up in a few minutes and that was 1998.
Honey, where's the baby?
Come dress me. I have a job interview.
No, you're the big baby!
Did I oversleep?
When you bring a bottle, make it bourbon.
How long was I asleep?
And what are you wearing?
Mom, I think I'm ready to start acting my age again.
Right now? Your crib or mine?
It was a mistake to come home for spring break.
I think my timeout has been long enough!
Just chillin' in my crib. 'sup with you?
none of my other friends that moved back home after college had to start over
OK, I see your point, but sometimes I feel you treat me like a child.
Mom, the student loan officer is in my closet again.
This time out seems longer than the others
Mom, we need to talk about this "you'll always be my baby boy" thing.
i'm old enough to know what you're doing in there.
I said I was ready for my 'own' crib, not my 'old' crib.
...and when you bring up my bottle, could you make it a dry New Zealand red?
When you said I could move home for a while this is not what I expected.
If he can be president, I can be a baby.
One step at a time. I just got her to stop breastfeeding.
Dad, this isn't what I meant when I said I wanted my own crib
Mom? Dad? How long is time out?
Mom? Dad? I've reached puberty.
I had that dream again where my degree is obsolete.
No, it's not weird. You guys wanted a baby. I needed a place to crash. Everybody wins.
You've made your point.
One mocha latte - in a sippy cup, please!
Is it just me - or does it seem like our whole country is regressing?
If the President can act like a child why can't I?
Oh not much just chilling in my crib
I don't think you read the directions right. I'm sure the baby should be in here.
I'll call you back. I'm busy regressing.
I can't sleep. I want a glass of scotch and wawa.
Mom, I think I had a growth spurt
I'm glad this helps soothe your empty nest anxiety, but I'll still need a ride back to Dartmouth in the morning.
Has hell frozen over yet?
I'm done thinking about what I did.
OK Mom, I promise to start looking for a job if you'll let me have my old room back.
My parents don't really understand the concept behind leap year.
It's just until I finish grad school.
Do you really think I don’t know what the two of you are doing?
Just wondering how long this time-out is going to last.
Bringing home girls is a bit awkward.
Is he still president?
A lot of millennials are moving back home after college!
Mom...Dad...you said, 'just a minute...'
You better believe I need a change.
Mom, Dad...can you PLEASE keep it down? I gotta go to work tomorrow!
He's on the potty. May I take a message?
I'll still be covered until 26 though right?
Mom, are you done filling out my college applications yet?
Lots of millenials have to move back in with their parents
Your dad and I realized you were never moving out, so we are.
No Mom, I definitely plan to have my own place by the time I'm 30.
I really don't think this is going to fool the IRS, or your health plan.
I'm writing your college essay, honey. Now go to sleep.
Mom, did you finish writing my résumé yet?
Nope, still grounded.
Dad, can I borrow the stroller this weekend?
I'm six feet, brown eyes, blonde hair and I enjoy kissing on the first date. How about you?
Yes Grandma, everything is exactly as I remember. Exactly!
They said they would be right back.
Ok, Mom, you've proved your point. I'll get a job.
Mom, can you bring me a beer?
Can't wait to pick their old-age home.
Mom? Dad? Do you realize the sitter went home twelve years ago?
I promise, Mom, I'll start looking for a job tomorrow.
I know I promised if you let me move back in I'd take my old room back--but this is ridiculous!
I can hear you too you know...
Definitely applying for jobs tomorrow.
I found this great deal on Air BNB.
This isn't what I meant by 'sleep like a baby.'
Mom, Dad, I think we need to talk.
Uh Mom, this wasn't what I had in mind when I said I was moving back home.
Mom. Don't forget to get me up for work tomorrow.
Okay, mom, I can take a hint - I'm moving out next week.
Is my time out over?
Doing everything I can to ensure I stay on my parents' health insurance in the event the ACA is dismantled.
Hey Ma... my growth spurt finally hit.
Day 17. They suspect nothing.
For the millionth time, Mom, I'm sorry I had to move back in after college.
It’s not just a phase, mom!
How about parlaying that philosophy degree into a big boy bed?
Am I still grounded?
Are you sure keeping me at this emotional level will help me become President one day?
Not getting any younger here, over...
They only let me out to sign executive orders.
Ground control to Major Mom.
THIS is my Airbnb rental?
No, mom, I'm okay. It was just another student debt nightmare.
I must have overslept.
Am I still in timeout?
This is what happens when you move back home after college.
Mom, how long is this timeout going to last?
I guess I should have taken them seriously AND literally when they said ''sleep like a baby'' in their airbnb listing.
Can you come read me the New York Times?
I had a bad dream, could you bring a warm glass of wine?
Need a diaper change and a large cheese pizza up here.
Commander Zeltar, I'm here with the human family - but I think they may suspect something.
This is not quite as you advertised on Airbnb...
Can I borrow the car after my nap?
Mom, I think I'm ready to move into my own place now.
Until my college loans are paid off.
Mom, we need to talk.
November 5th, 2020 - "Is it safe to come out yet?"
It's not ideal, but this Airbnb saves me $100 a night.
Listen, Mama, I can't speak for all the other babies in day care, but I feel like I've aged 30 years since the election.
What do you mean I'm too immature for a relationship?
I will not be attending the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening!
Mom, when I said I wanted a cell, I meant a cell phone.
I'm starting to think there's no one on the other end of this.
Mommy, I'm pretty sure there was growth hormone in the milk.
Uh, mom? I think we overslept.
The worst part of homeschooling is nap time.
Mommy? Can I have a glass of milk and $300,000 dollars for college?
Finally got my own crib!
And how much have you budgeted for all the therapy I'm going to need?
Honey, aren't you playing the nanny?
We need to discuss "your house, your rules". Do you copy?
Whoa. How long have I been asleep?
Come over! I'm just chillin' in my crib.
Oh I'm the one the being childish?
But if the President can act this way, why can't I?
How is Mommy's big, handsome, independent boy this morning?
What was in that last bottle you gave me?
Doc - wouldn't it be easier if I just sat on the couch and told you about my childhood?
It seems like I've been in 'time-out' forever.
Could you text me a bedtime story?
Ok I'm ready to role play. Come rob the cradle.
Ok. One last nap then it's mid-life crisis.
I don't care that it's been 25 years. I'm still. Not. Tired.
That's the last time I book through aircnb.
So this whole time I could have been on your insurance without pretending?
I think I'll just get my own health insurance
All right. You win. I will finish the broccoli.
Mom, dad, I had a growth spurt last night!
My therapist says you may be infantilizing me
All I said was,I wanted my own crib.
When we said you could have your old room back after college, this isn't exactly what we meant.
Don't let me oversleep. I have to brief the president in the morning.
Mom, why can't you be like other parents and just take away the keys to the car?
Is it okay if Susie sleeps over?
Mom, Dad, I'm breathing easily, no anxiety to speak of, diaper is good, no choking hazards, and I'm about to roll a joint.
Honey, i'm still in my safe space but could you bring me a cup of coffee and the Times?
I think you misunderstood me when I said I wanted my own crib.
Mom, I think I overslept.
Are you sure this will get me another year on your insurance?
I'm fine Mom. Really. Check the monitor.
Am I still in timeout?
I grew up so fast.
Mom, wake me up early tomorrow. I have a job interview.
Not tonight Honey. I'm reliving my childhood.
Please send me a village.
Mom, wake me up at 7, I have an interview tomorrow.
I'm getting the feeling I've outstayed my welcome.
Hold all my calls, clear my afternoon schedule, and . . . bring me by blankie.
millennial to mommy, over
No, not water...a drink.
Did you forget about my time-out?
I need my bottle now, perhaps a Merlot
When was the last time you checked on the baby?
Mom? Dad? Am I still on the waiting list for that perfect pre-school?
Hey Mom, better check to see if Dad put the baby in my bed.
Mom, would you bring me an Ambien and a shot of whiskey?
Several things need changing.
It got weird last night.
I suppose using the car tonight is out of the question?
I'm going to need you to push back my 10:00 with Timmy.
Your crib or mine?
Don't you think I'm getting a little too old for a nightlight?
You probably should have splurged on that hormone free formula.
Mom, can you bring me a rum and coke?
And Tink — Cancel my 7:00 with Hook. And get some flowers for Wendy.
Ground control to Major Mom.
If I start paying rent can I have the bed back, Mom?
Who's Mommy's sweet millennial?
Did I really sleep that long?
I'll stop acting like one when you stop treating me like one.
Hey Ma, could you bring me a beer?
Hey Siri, when does childhood end?
Siri, how do I get out?
Oedipus to Mom! Do you read me?
Look, this diaper isn't going to change itself.
I should have known when he called me "baby" on our first date.
Is Trump still President?
Cappuccino, no foam.
You should come over and check out my crib.
Ready for my cocoa. Shaken, not stirred.
How many more years of Time Out do I have left?
Mom, just how long is this "time out" going to be?!
Is Trump still President?
I'll grow up as soon as our president does.
Wait... I thought that when I graduated from college I'd be living in the basement.
This is the last night I'm helping you with your empty nest regression therapy
Does anyone know how long I've been asleep?
Now that I've been accepted to M.I.T., can I get a regular bed?
Is my time out over yet? I'm 23.
I'm starting to doubt this is how you play cribbage.
I had that nightmare about getting a job.
Party at my crib tonight.
Yes mom, all my college applications have been submitted.
I don't need the night light any more.
Mom? . . . Dad? . . . Anybody there? . . .
This is not what I meant when I said I need a little space.
Honey, I think we are doing this baby bed-sharing incorrectly.
Mom, really, it's time to let go.
Remember my college applications are due tomorrow.
Hang in there son; the Republicans will soon repeal Obamacare and you won't have to pretend you're under 26 anymore.
Um, Mom? Was I not supposed to touch the bottle that said "Drink Me?"
Come on, I've been in this timeout forever!
Yes, I know we're married but my parents think maybe you shouldn't move in just yet!
Am I still grounded?
True, but I get to stay on my parents' insurance 'til I'm 26.
Don't forget, my college loan payment is due tomorrow.
Hey, mom, any word from Yale yet?
Mommy, I'm thirsty. Can you bring me a beer?
This isn't what I meant by 'help me start over.'
I've got a girl coming over to see my crib.
I need my bottle. There should be a six-pack in the fridge.
Mom, would you bring in my teddy bear, and my notes for economics midterm?
Can we at least stop calling this a 'baby' monitor?
I forgot my 'safe' word.
My diaper is not going to change itself.
I'll be out of here as soon as those manufacturing jobs come back.
There's growth hormone in the baby formula.
I will always be your baby. Can I get out now?
But mom, millennials are staying at home longer than previous generations.
Mom, what kind of mushroom was that?
"I think the human growth hormones are working".
OK, I'll get a job and move out!
Alexa, can I get out now?
Mom? Please bring me some cookies and a bottle of scotch.
Growth spurt, Mom.
What? The preschool turned me down again?
You know, maybe I shouldn't move back home after graduation.
When does IKEA open tomorrow?
What's the safe word again, hun?
I get it. You're upset that I'm leaving for college.
Ok, I am ready to leave my comfort zone.
Okay I'll get a job!
For the record I was pretty fussy around an hour ago
Look at me, I'm HUGE. Tremendous. And one day, I'm going to be the President.
Could we just go back to having curfew?
So is there a time "in?"
Mom, I still have to go to college next year..
What are you wearing?
Day 7: Still no figurative connection to my inner child.
Mom, you really have to stop treating me like a child.
It's time for my bottle of wine.
But Mom, everyone else my age has a cell phone!
I'm old enough for a smart phone.
So this is part of my new health coverage up to age 26?
Just how long is this time-out going to last, mother?
Um, I was thinking more the basement?
Well, of course she had a c-section.
Mom, all of my friends were allowed to move into the basement after college!
I thought you said, "You'd be right back"!
Then when can Suzie come for a sleep-over?
So, yeah, like, could you just like fill out the job application for me?
Beer. No nipple.
Come on over and check out my new crib.
Mom, I'm starting to think you're over-protective.
Wendy, I don't think Peter is coming
Tell them I'm working from my safe space today.
Mom, I need you to come pick me up.
At what point do we stop calling this thing a "baby" monitor?
My 401K needs changing.
Mom, am I still covered under your insurance?
Hi Mom I don't need a night light anymore
86 the bottle. Make it a large pepperoni and a Bud.
What have you been putting in my formula?
Who says you can't go home again?
Waa. Over.
Are they ever coming back?
Mom, are you listening? I said I think it's time I moved out.
The genie blew it. On my third and final wish, I asked for a luxury crib fit for a rock star.
Mom..? I REALLY overslept this time.
Mama, what exactly was the "formula" in that last bottle?
Guess who got their old bed back?
Am I still on a time out?
Child to Helicopter Parent. Come in, Helicopter Parent.
I promise I won't grow up to be a millennial.
Mom, is there a student loan officer under my bed?
The least you could do would be to rub whiskey on my gums.
How soon before you finish reading that Dr. Spock book?
Their parents haven't come back yet, but I'm safe from the kids.
How's about a bottle of beer and a warm blankie?
Siri, why am I in this crib?
Sorry honey, we donated all your big boy stuff, but you're welcome to stay as long as you need.
Yes Mom, I get your hint that you want grandchildren soon.
You guys have to stop babying me.
Um, Mom, if you ever take a break from Facebook, I think I'm ready for a big-kid bed.
Okay, I'm ready! The safe word is 'Pampers.'
Childhood isn't as good as I remember.
Mom, Dad, hold it down in there... I can hear everything.
Hey Dad, can I borrow the car?
If anyone's listening, this is day 57, year 13. I am still trapped. I have found no escape.
If you're listing, Mom—I'm starting to reconsider moving back-in.
Hello, Mom, could you bring me a beer?
Testing, goo, goo, gaa, gaa.
Mom, would you bring me my participation trophy?
Yeah.... my therapist said I need to embrace my inner child....
Sorry I can't join the protest, I'm in time out.
You know you can't actually ground me for my whole life, right?
If I hadn't wasted time on that Masters in English I'd be in a bunk bed by now.
Moving back in with Mom and Dad is really infantilizing.
If I pay rent can I have my big boy bed?
I just feel like I'm growing up too fast.
This demeans us both, over.
Ok. I'll look for a job tomorrow if you let me sleep in a big-boy bed.
Goodnight moon Goodnight oil tycoon Goodnight DAPL And the EPA Goodnight Obamacare Good night voices everywhere
It's been 10 years. Is anybody there?
...but I get to stay covered by my parents' health insurance!
If I do this they'll let me stay on your insurance?
I'm calling to report a case of arrested adolescence.
If you let me out, I promise to get my own health insurance.
The upside is kindergarten is going to be a breeze.
I think I'm old enough for vodka and a therapist now.
Warm milk sounds great...and a Xanax.
Mommy, what's a helicopter parent?
Honey, I just don't think role playing is my thing
Looking for binkie. Over.
Mom, for my generation it's totally normal to live at home until I'm at least 35.
Can I get a double expresso with extra milk?
What a nap! Who's president?
any chance you forgot about me up here
Mom! Dad! I am pretty sure that now that I have graduated from college, I am supposed to be in your basement.
I really had no idea that having a baby would change our relationship so drastically.
No, you're being childish!
Hey, Mom, do you think I could stay in a dorm next semester?
'I woke up a long time ago.'
Mocha frappuccino venti, Mommy, please.
I think I'm overdue for an upgrade.
Have we heard from Harvard yet?
Mother, I'm sorry I called you controlling.
Mom, can I borrow the car tomorrow night?
I'm STILL not sleepy.
How long am I grounded? Over.
Can I crawl in with you guys? I had a bad dream about college.
Mom? I think I might literally be growing up too fast.
How long IS this time out?...feels like it's been years.
Mom, are my college essays finished? Over.
You know grandpa and grandma used to play outside... by themselves... completely unsupervised, right?
How are my college applications coming along?
I'd like a turkey sandwich and student loan forgiveness, over.
I know the book says to leave the baby in his crib until he stops complaining, but isn't this getting ridiculous?
This has been like a really long Time-Out...
Mom said she’d come check on me, but that was 2009.
This Airbnb is pretty childish.
I could use a change.
How about just hanging out with me in my crib tonight?
Can you hear me now? My voice has changed.
I'm thirsty, can you bring me a beer?
Hello, room service?
I'm grounded, and won't be able to make Happy Hour.
911? Help! I'm being held prisoner by overprotective parents.
The only downside to living rent free with my parents is mandatory nap time.
Stop calling me a big baby!
This call may be recorded for training purposes.
Mom, I was thinking...could you go in tomorrow and defend my dissertation?
Mother? Have you finished filling out my job applications yet?
You do know that 'sleep like a baby' is just an expression?
I'll look for a job in the morning.
It's not as relaxing as I remember.
Mom, a growth spurt is putting it mildly.
Hey dude, you've gotta come check out my new crib.
Yo, bro. In my crib. Chillin.
Mom, Dad, you wanna hold it down in there.
...and tomorrow can you tell my professor that I really feel like I deserve an A
But Mom, you said you would be right back!
Mom, where do post-millennials come from?
"hanging at your crib" isn't as exciting as I thought it would be
Hey Dad, it's Donnie. Can I borrow just one million to buy some Manhattan real estate?
Uber ... I'll be in pajamas, stars and moons.
Can I cancel next month's growth hormone shipment?
Yeah, let's do lunch tomorrow at the sandbox.
Remember, kids, you can stay five forever and still be president!
Well I guess technically the airbnb ad was correct; this place could sleep three.
This is my son, he's 298 months old..."
Mommy, I need my pacifier...or some weed.
I'm not only still breathing, mom and dad, I'm 23 years old.
Pat, please tell the Board of Directors that I am ready to apologize.
You guys never let me do ANYTHING! Billy's parents let HIM out 11 years ago!!
I'm past the difficult years. Can I come out now?
Mom, Dad, I wish you hadn't keep the room the way you remember it.
20 years for a time out seems a bit excessive
Earth to overprotective parents. Earth to overprotective parents.
Mom, I really don't need a nightlight. Quit coddling me.
Babe, how many more parenting classes are left?
So I decided, if the president can act like an overgrown baby, why shouldn't I?
Helicopter Mom are you there? Over
Okay honey I've learned my lesson, can I at least move back to the couch now?
I don't care if it's another 10 years...I still won't eat kale.
I'm not being cranky, Mom. I just think it's time for a big-boy bed.
Mom, Dad ... I think we have overslept
No, actually I feel less safe.
Are you sure my time out isn't over?
Do you think that you have it bad? My parents treat me like a baby.
Now can I stay on my parents' health insurance?
If only I'd been born on March 1st...
Did you finish my college applications?
When you said I can stay at your"crib" this is not what I had in mind.
How about if I promise not to mention the President for a full week?
No, not milk, but I would like a bottle.
I'm in. They suspect nothing, I mean, Goo-ga. Goo-ga.
I'm not leaving my bed until Trump is gone and the world is SAFE again.
Mom, I'm thirsty...but this time, could you make it on the rocks, and use the good cherries?
It's time for my 2:00 a.m. feeding--how about pizza?
I am not a big baby!
Let's just say that I think I've hit a bit of a growth spurt.
I know why the caged bird sings.
Is time-out going to be over soon?
Tell me the one again with the 'Debt-free Graduate and the Rent Controlled Apartment.'
20 is the new 0.
No, but you have given me a great topic for my college admission essay.
Stop treating me like a child!
I'm just waiting for my parents to come pick me up
I know you can hear me..
Son to Mother! I'm over my terrible two's.
I'm staying here until the Trump presidency is over.
Am I grounded for my life or yours?
Mom, Dad, I sure hope you are saving up for my therapy.
Quit treating me like a baby! I'm 216 months old!
I'm don't feel that regressive therapy is working for me.
Mom, come quick! Growth spurt!
I have a doctorate in sociology. I think I'm ready for a big boy bed.
Good News, Mom - I'm born again!
This isn't what I had in mind when you told me to call you "Mommy"
I should have been more specific when I asked my parents for a pen.
Please let me out Mom...I'm going to miss my job interview.
Mom, when can I move into the basement?
Mom, Dad...I appreciate you trying to keep me on your health coverage, but...
I must have fallen asleep.
When you said I could crash at your crib, I had the MTV version in my mind.
You know what they say 23 is the new three
I know I am 35 and don't have a job, but I find this a little passive aggressive.
I don't understand--why can't you go to the job interview for me?
I'd like to report a robbery. Someone has taken my childhood.
I am working from home today.
Just how long AM I grounded?
Dear Diary....I just thought I'd be further along by now
Two eggs,scrambled.Coffee,black
Mom, did you remember to send in my college applications?
My parents are pretending it's the beginning of the Obama Administration.
Wait. I've been asleep for how long?
Get the stroller and meet me out back
This administration has aged us all.
Is this a bad time to tell you my girlfriend’s pregnant?
Hey Mom, you know that time machine I was telling you about?
Sorry, I know being a Leap Year Baby sucks now, but one day you'll appreciate it.
Mom?...Dad?...Is there anyone there? It's me...Barron.
Is he still president?
College is great, Mom! Plenty of trigger warnings and a nice, cozy dorm room.
Is my time out over?
This mission might go wrong, sir. My cover's gonna get blown sooner or later.
Yeah, Mom - more than a little over protective.
Hey Mom, Is my timeout over ?
Mom, stop treating me like a baby.
You said you'd be right back, 12 years ago.
Hey Mom, I have my LSAT tomorrow. Can you wake me early?
Climb out of your crib and get your own glass of water!
Mom, so far Harvard's just like you described it.
Mom...can you call my boss and tell him I'm not feeling well please?
Okay, I'm ready to act like a big boy now.
It's just a really tough job market for recent grads right now.
Hey, gang, my crib tonight or yours?
Just checking in to see how that IKEA toddler bed is going.
So how is this going to work next year when I'm away at college?
You were supposed to be out of your crib after 24 MONTHS, not YEARS.
Baby to Mommy: There is definitely some kind of growth hormone in the milk.
What do you mean, act your age?
Day 2. The bottle said 'Drink me.'
Oh all right! You're my daddy. Happy now?
Can you hear me now?
Mom, Dad, have you ever thought you may be a tad overprotective?
They suspect nothing.
It's not the bed in this B&B i'm worried about, Terry. It's the breakfast.
I can’t sleep, Mom. Please text me a story.
Could you throw a little Kahlua into that milk?
Hey Mom -- I need a ride to work.
I think they're on to me.
I needed to find my inner child.
How about you come over to my crib and chill tonight?
Hello, room service?
Donald J. Trump, Age 15
I can't fall asleep with you constantly listening.
If you did this to Fluffy, the ASPCA would be all over you.
The after-party starts at midnight. My crib
Okay, Mom, I get your point ... moving back in requires chipping in.
Well, then could I have a gin and tonic?
I'm onto you, mom & dad. There no such thing as "alternative beds".
Mom, do you think we could back off a little on the parental controls?
I know I said that I want my own crib...
Mom, it's time for my 2 a.m. twitter feed.
Sweetheart, next time please read the Airbnb listing a little more carefully.
I know why the caged bird sings.
Can you bring the financials with my milk?
Alright Helen, I take it back. I'm not jealous of the baby.
Bring my stroller...and a latté.
This isn't exactly what I meant when I asked to move back into my old room, but since I'm here how about those milk and cookies?
Failure to launch
Sure, when I can afford it, I'd love to have my own crib.
Not only is this unnecessary, Mom, but you'll never get Mexico to pay for it.
Thomas Wolfe just may have been right.
HELLO. Mom. Dad. Anybody there? I promise, I will start my job search just as soon as I get out of here.
I'm not being childish. I just can't move out of Manhattan right now.
Can you bring me a scotch?
Young Trump 4 am Tweet, "TREMENDOUS BEDWETTING, THE GREATEST, NO QUESTION."
But you have to let me out -- I won the Election!
Hello? Anyone? Has Trump issued an Executive Order dismantling No Child Left Behind?
No, not formula, beer.
You forgot to tuck me in
When you said you were into baby talk this wasn’t what I had in mind.
Hey, Mommy, what's human growth hormone?
I said I was sorry like a million years ago.
FYI: I'm not moving out, and you can't make me.
I forgot my safe word, can we start over?
Mom, do I get my own room when I graduate from Stanford?
You wanna come over to my crib?
Just a reminder that you have 10 minutes before my next feeding.
Is time out over? I'm 20 now.
Mummy? Davy wants a martini.
Mom, any news on my appeal?
So unfair! Joey was allowed to move to a big boy bed when he turned 14.
Wanna hang at my crib tonight?
I'll have the Gerber's Alfredo, please.
Is my time out over yet?
...and I think it's time I met some girls, too.
This is not my idea of role playing!
...until eighteen MONTHS.
When I said I wanted to go back to a simpler time I didn't mean this!
Mom, who is The Donald and why is he tweeting me?
Mom, can you bring me a bottle? Vodkas's fine.
Mommy, 'nuther growth spurt!
Yeah mom I'm doing fine at college, don't worry. I even got my own crib.
I'm ready to move to the basement.
After tonight, no more Fetish Fridays.
Honey, your father and I owe you an apology, we may have let you over-sleep.
Wanna hang out at my crib or yours ?
When you bring my bottle this time make it a Bud.
Could we meet at your place? I'm a little penned in.
It's a go. I'm breaking out of the pen tonight.
Mom, is quiet time over yet? It's been a while.
Sleeping like a baby's not all it's cracked up to be.
But my girl friend can take me. She drives.
Your Father and I are right here. Now, go to sleep. You have your boards tomorrow.
I'm not leaving as long as Donald Trump is president.
Don't you think I'm old enough to sleep without this nightlight on?
I pooped again. Over.
Mommy, I want a glass of merlot.
Sell the Amazon stock, move it into CXW and bring me my bottle.
"You can't baby me forever," wasn't a challenge, Mom.
But Mommy, I need my blankie--it's finals week!
Ok, I'll stop "acting like a baby." Can I come back to bed, now?
Mommy, I'm at the "safe space" in my dorm.
Did I miss school.....I mean all of it?
This is your millennial wakeup call.
I'd like to make dinner reservatuons for two, for tomorrow, for when the big hand is on the 12, and the little hand on the 7.
Still cheaper than a dorm room.
All things being equal, I prefer the swear jar!
I guess this is you both being passive-aggessive about me moving back home.
I'm not coming out until the 2020 elections.
Warm almond milk and my completed college application essays please.
I figured that method-acting may help me understand the mindset of our president a little bit better.
I'll be down in a minute, honey; I am still checking in with my inner child.
Is this your way of telling me I'm not welcomed back home?
So, mommy, have we heard back from any of the colleges I applied to?
We need to talk about being 'the baby in the family'.
Really! I'm still grounded!
I know, your house, your rules, but...
Hey MOM!, I'm up...can you bring me a double shot, half caff, ristretto, venti, 4-pump, sugar free, cinnamon, dolce vanilla soy, no-foam, skinny latte
Can I order a pizza with this thing?
I'm trying to communicate with my 'inner child'.
I really should have my own bed and an Iphone by now.
Is anyone listening?
Not the role playing I had in mind.
Maybe my shrink was speaking figuratively.
Can I have a glass of vodka?
you'll never win the cartoon caption contest in the New Yorker, go to bed!
Wake up, Sweetie. Time to go to college.
Pick up another 500 shares of Facebook at the open.
Toddler-One to Helicopter Mom, I think I’m ready for a change. Over.
Do you really think this will qualify me as your dependent now that my health insurance is being cancelled?
The dorm's great, just like home.
Why did we ever move into this New York apartment? *** PLEASE NOTE: Submitted on behalf of my 10 year old son - Nathan Toby Neulander

Twenty-two is the new two, Mom.
Mommy ! Is my Timeout over yet ?
My mom said since I wasn’t going to give her grandchildren, I would have to do.

Hey Mom is the time out up yet?
Mom, Dad - I'm ready for college now.
I'm sorry about this weekend, but I'm SOoo Grounded!!
My parents said they would be right back, but it seems like they have been gone a long time.
I'm thinking Enfamil and Netflix. You?
This is not what I was expecting when you said "let's go back to my crib".
The doctor says that he is right on track for a millennial.
Check out my sweet crib.
Can I get that sippy cup to go?

You know I start college in a month.
Not exactly what I meant by 'retro'.

Mom, now that I have my license, don't you think it's time for a car bed?
Mom, I have a Master's Degree.
Mom, is he still the president? Can I come out?
Mom or Dad, could you bring me a beer.
Dear, just because I threw up and wet myself after the party doesn't mean I deserve this.
Mom? Dad? You know I can hear you with this thing, and now I understand what you are doing
What do you mean. "I'm acting like a two year old?"
Uh, hello..I'm still waiting to be changed.
It's not working. I still feel old.
I'm getting too old for this.
These aren't the types of bars I had in mind.
Hey Mom ! Don't forget your driving me to work tomorrow !

I get that you're not ready to have a teenager, but I need a ride to the school dance in an hour.
Is this time out about over ?
Wow! This call center has me on hold forever.
No, why don’t you quit acting like a baby?
It's my turn to chant 'lock her up' and your turn to be Hillary.

At this rate, I'll be 30 before you let me drive.
Just finishing my crib notes.
Mom, I'm still waiting for you to fill out my college applications.
Yo, I'm gonna chill out in my own crib tonight

Mom? Dad? Come in. I’ve decided I am too old... for a night light. Over.

You win, I'll do my homework.
Why does this always happen when I come and visit mom and dad?
Mom? I'm having that dream again.
Batteries must be flat. I've been trying to get their attention for twelve years.
I'm adopted?
Oh yeah, Dad? At least I can see the cage I'm in.
Applesauce to start; Peanut butter and jelly on rye for my entrée and a large chocolate milk, please

Mum? Dad? I think there might have been a mix-up at the hospital.
All I ever get from you lately is static.
