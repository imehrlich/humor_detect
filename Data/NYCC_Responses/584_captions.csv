Sir, the President's Council on Women's Health has arrived.
The sperm bank class action lawsuit clients are here.
We may have a problem in the copy room.
Remember when you wished we had a hundred just like him?
It's Mr. Wilson, sir. I think he's gone viral.
That's correct, sir. The door to accounting was left open and now they're loose.
Okay, describe him again.
Tell Jim to stop messing with the 3D printer.
Sorry, but you never specified the gender of the 72 virgins.
Hey Jim, on second thought, we're going to need those name tags.
The diversity training seminar looks like it's wrapping up.
That's right. The Diversity Committee meeting is just breaking up.
We might have been too specific in our job description.
...and I'll be the one in high heels.
Describe him.
Yes, of course we can spare one.
Looks like the women's healthcare committee just got out.
The 3-D printer is stuck again.
I'm just not convinced they are as committed to diversity as they say.
I'm just not sure I'm going to fit in at this company.
Yes, this is the office of Haber, Haber, Haber, Haber, Haber, Haber, Haber, Haber, Haber, Haber, Haber, Haber, Haber, Haber, Haber, Haber, Haber, Haber, Haber, Haber, Haber, and Haber.
We're starting to see the effects of Trump's immigration restrictions.
Clowns?? I thought you said "send in the clones."
There was a typo on his resume. Apparently he's "one AND a million".
The President's council on diversity just arrived!
I definitely stand out from the other applicants so I think I have a shot.
I'm not sure... middle-aged white men all look the same to me.
Scones! I clearly said two dozen scones!
we've just figured out how he managed not to miss a day of work!
You were right. You've seen one accountant, you've seen em all.
No! I asked for copies of THE bill, not Bill.
We'll need 129 turkey-on-white, mayo only, and one Caesar salad, extra garlic.
This is Acme Cloning. Your Fred's are done.
I'm not sure we're hitting our diversity goals.
Remember how I told Leonard I'd like to see more of him?
Yes, he blends right in.
Frankly Mr. Prescott, all the job applicants look pretty much the same.
Trust me Sally, meeting somebody at work is not an option.
There may be a problem with our random sample.
Your request to find someone 'just like Marvin' turned out to be incredibly successful.
Seriously... of all the people to clone, you chose Gus?
It's a clear case of identity theft.
Is he bald, with mustache and glasses?
Hello, Overstock.com?
He hasn't come out yet
I just realized I'm the token hire.
Good meeting. Everyone's on the same page
The bald guy, with the mustache and glasses? Yeah, I see him.
How do I turn off the 3D printer?
They normally don't migrate until tax season.
I've got a bunch of Bills here that need to be paid.
Well, it looks like our want ad may have been too narrowly focused
Trump's diversity coalition is here.
Boss? It's about that new 3-D printer?
Ah yes, Mr. Jones your copies have arrived.
This could be a challenge for our facial recognition software.
I'm down here in Cloning. Bring a thousand pocket protectors.
Remember when you said this company could use 100 more Bobs?
Could you please send someone down, the accountants have gotten loose again.
So much for our face recognition cybersecurity system.
Good morning, Doppel, Doppel, Doppel, Doppel and Ganger. This is Maureen, how may I help you?
No, I am not kidding. And the worse part is, they all make 21% more than me.
Oh, you said clowns. I thought you said clones.
I'd like to place an order for one hundred pocket protectors.
How do I turn off the 3D printer?
I have to call you back. The Blue Ribbon Panel to Determine Women's Reproductive Rights just adjourned.
Okay, the good news is we figured out cloning. The bad news is we tested it on Ed.
The vote was unanimous.
The Bills just keep piling up.
Never mind. It looks like they fixed the copier.
...when I said, "I wish we had 100 Howards," I was speaking figuratively.
The engineering department is here for the diversity training.
The Yes-Men are here, sir.
Well, we did tell George to go find himself.

Yes, Sir. Harvey set the 3-D printer on Selfie mode again.
Remember that door you said Never open? Ok, Ok, but what do I do now?
Yes - I'm just outside. I'm the one with..........You can't miss me.
I think they've reached consensus.
I know this will sound weird, but the conference room is full of Dicks.
Mr. Shaffer? About your 1967 Sperm donation....
Tell me again exactly, what does he look like?
Ok, I will need a better description than "the dorky one with glasses."
It appears the Senate Women's Health Care Panel has already adjourned, ma'am.
I'm afraid none of the applicants really stand out.
OMG ... they all have identical ties.
Hi, it's Janice. Could you send someone over to fix our copier?
It's true... accountants can multiply.
And get this—they all got out of the same car.
The accountants are rioting.
It's about that redundancy consultant we hired.
Trust me, he's gone viral.
Oh and don't forget the name tags.
They seem to have learned how to open the door. Bring some accountant food and I'll lure them back to work.
Can I call you later? I'm about to meet with the President's cabinet.
You know how you said you wished you had a hundred guys just like Harold?
I have to go. We're being investigated by the Freds.
Get Quality Control over here now. One of them has pants that are too dark.
We're going to need name tags.
Hello, could you send out a tech for our 3-D printer?
I think we should expand our target demographic.
I think I'm going to need a more detailed description.
You know perfectly well that's not what I meant when I asked you to send me a bunch of fresh herbs.
I'd say the staff is of one mind, yes.
Sorry, I'm having trouble finding the original.
Bob 13 ?? Bob 13?? Phone's for you.
Not bugs....an infestation of Dougs.
I think we're going to need a bigger men's room.
Tell the 3D printer guy to get up here damn quick!!
Hello, Equifax? I'm calling about a large case of identity theft.
Sorry to bother you sir, but the 3D printer is stuck on "dork".
Honey? I think I'm at the wrong Men's Warehouse.
Gimme my agent. This is the worst ever Bachelorette season!
We need a repairman right away! The 3-D printer won't turn off!
The Republicans are here.
The Bills are adding up.
I'm afraid you'll have to be a little more specific.
I'm looking at him right now.
Can I call you back? Everyone and his brother just showed up.
How would I know if they're anatomically correct?
Please tell me I'm looking for someone without glasses.
No mom, all the guys here are the same.
Yeah, hang on, it looks like the conference on women's health is getting out.
I almost didn't recognize you guys.
Yes, sir, the Diversity Committee is here to see you.
Hang on, the President's focus group is just now leaving.
No, I would describe it more like a ‘flash Bob.’
Sir, the Diversity Committee meeting just adjourned.
Remember that zealous sperm donor we had 40 years ago?
How was the ad worded for the current job opening?
Who authorized a 3-D printer for Accounting?
Trust me, none of the guys at work are my type.
Didn't you say, "When Willard died they broke the mold?"
Where should I send the diversity committee?
No, I haven't found him yet, but your description was very accurate.
You guys are all the same.
No, Mr. President, facing a different direction does not qualify as diversity.
Yes, Mr. Giddes, they've finally hatched
The applicants are here. Our diversity initiative is not working.
Yes Bernice, I DO know accountants are good at multiplication....
Is it possible my online dating profile was too specific?
He has a scar where?
No sir. I wouldn't say that any candidate has stood out thus far.
You'll have to give me a little more to go on.
What kind of sperm bank only has one donor?
Don't ask why, just tell me: is it a SCHOOL of accountants or a GAGGLE of accountants?
A Mr. Schrödinger to see you, sir.
It was unanimous.
I distinctly ordered no moustache!
It must have been a long delivery for their Mom.
Doctor Schrödinger was right! We found the portal to the accounting universe!
I'm pretty sure they're not from Black Lives Matter....
The diversity and inclusion meeting just let out.
We're being audited.
Remember when you told Bob from accounting he was so bad at his job that you weren't even sure he knew how to multiply.
So far nobody really stands out.

Maybe my Match.com ad was TOO specific.
I said, 'Send in the clowns,' not the clones!
Yes. I have some men here with some complaints about the new facial recognition software.
Did you tell accounting that there were free donuts on the fifth floor today?
It's not racist to say if they all really do look alike
The President's cabinet meeting is over.
My mother was right; all men really are the same.
I've said it before and I'll say it again, Barbara. Men are all the same!
No, really -- when you've seen one you have seen them all.
If I've seen Juan? I've seen them all!
You'll never believe this. Everyone is wearing the same tie.
No, I said twenty copies of *the* bill from accounting!
My personal ad may have been too specific
I don't recognize any of them.
Try "Force Quit." If that doesn't work, unplug the damn thing.
The doppel gang is here.
It's astounding. All the men coming out of the room are wearing the same ties.
I'm really not surprised that they all look alike but what are the odds that they would wear the same tie?
Mr. Lemming is here.
Can you be way way way more specific?
I think I may have figured out what that "Multiverse" button on our copy machine does, Marge.
The guys from Xerox are here.
Mm mm. I'm not sure, describe him again.
It appears we have an embarrassment of Richards.
I don't think I'm going to fit in here.
Is this a metaphor or a facsimile?

When I said I needed a hundred copies of the bill, I wasn't talking about that Bill.
