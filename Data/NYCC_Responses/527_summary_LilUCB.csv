41,8,1,"""Greeting. I'm here to announce our diversity program""."
43,11,2,I thought small farmers didn't exist.
36,0,0,We’ve been told the term ‘peasant’ is politically non-bias-free. Would you prefer the term ‘pastorally-oriented provincialist’?
46,3,5,"There's no presidential election up there, right?"
39,5,0,I'm going to make you an offer for your planet you can't refuse.
