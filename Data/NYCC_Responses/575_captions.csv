Let's pick up the pace. They're billing by the hour.
Apparently they're experts in hostile takeovers.
We sue at dawn.
This time they'll know we mean business.
Well, on the other hand, there is no fee unless we win.
Pillaging lasts a day, these guys will screw them for years!
We may have lost the battle, but we'll win the appeal.
The field will soon be littered with habeas corpuses.
...so I told the genie I wanted a hoard of the most ruthless and feared men from throughout history...
You just had to say "Run it by the lawyers", didn't you?
You better be right about the pen being mightier than the sword.
So, it's a legal battle they want?
Hostile takeovers ain’t what they used to be.
The streets will run red with tape
You realize we're only gonna get a third of the plunder...
I liked it better when we settled disputes out of court.
Don't worry, these guys know how to charge.
You think it's overkill, because you've never been through a divorce.
Explain to me again this idea of pillageable hours.
Trust me, nothing crushes the enemy's spirit like long-term financial planning.
That's the last time I let you occupy Wall Street
I hate legal battles.
First we'll hit the castle with code violations.
Nobody ever expects the Spanish Deposition.
I said, 'Suits of armor,' not 'Armani suits.'
Now that we've captured these lawyers, let's threaten to release one every hour until our ransom demands are met.
I call it "shock and audit."
This time we mean business.
Instead of sacking their castle, we'll offer a reverse mortgage.
You're the one who wanted to negotiate.
It's not war that's hell, it's the paperwork.
I wanted “a counting of our troops.” Not “accountants for our troops!”
There is no way she is getting the beach house.
For once corporate seems to have our backs.
I texted headquarters to send us 10,000 new “insurgents.” Their spellchecker changed it to “insurance agents.”
I'm beginning to think we should have settled out of court.
Who said anything about invasion? I'm preparing for evasion.
The ad said they specialize in assault and battery.
There's an ambulance up ahead. Maybe we can lose them there.
First we rape and pillage then we audit the hell out if them
Trust me, nobody plunders like these guys.
remember when we used to conquer without having to run it through legal?
I should have read the Magna Carta before I signed it.
Obviously we have two very different interpretations of "hostile takeover"
They shall learn to fear the name of Zorrak the Litigious !
'So sue me,' he says.
I'm already regretting this merger
We may lose this battle, but we'll have them tied up in court for years.
I guess he wasn't kidding. He does have an army of lawyers.
They're docile now, but just wait until they lose cell reception.
Their résumés all said 'headhunter'
Remember, we're not here to negotiate.
The pen had damn well BETTER be mightier than the sword!
I told you to order armored suits, not Armani suits!
Let's see if he refuses to release his tax returns now.
I brought sticks and stones just in case.
Let's gallop, just for fun.
We'll attack when the defense rests.
My lawyer? Lemming & Lemming....why do you ask?
These corporate raids just don't have the same vibe.
Hostile takeovers ain’t what they used to be.
I will never surrender my tax returns.
I'm not losing a battle on a technicality ever again.
I don't care if Barney's had a sale. Next time I'll pick the uniforms myself.
I realize it seems cruel. But the King's subjects must be made to understand that The Black Death is in fact a disqualifying pre-existing condition under the terms of the policy.
I miss the old days when everything wasn't litigated to death.
Well, at least we'll know whether the pen really is mightier than the sword.
In a few miles, we should water the horses and cocktail the lawyers.
Just explain it to me one more time....the difference between an Inquisition and an audit is what again?
Do they know that CHARGE is an order and not a transaction?
Now that we've drained the swamp, what are we supposed to do with them?
Wait'll they find out the king never pays his lawyers.
How much further is the cliff?
I kept telling you to claim all your looting as income.
Sometimes you have to go to war with the army you have not the army you want.
I used to love being a barbarian. Now I just feel dirty.
I'm expecting a legal battle
If any dare to resist us, their streets will run red with tape.
Wars kill. Litigation destroys!!!
I take it this is a civil war.
I have my doubts about these new Homeland Security hires.
Well, at least we'll now see if the pen is mightier than the sword.
I remember when the legal department was just Hrothgar, the rack, and a thumbscrew.
So you're sure he said game of torts?
Attacking our enemies with an army of lawyers seems needlessly cruel.
Sorry, but I still see a difference between raping and pillaging and just screwing people out of health insurance.
Let's quicken the pace, they're billing by tenths of an hour.
They call me Erik The Litigious.
We're adventure capitalists.
I miss the old days, when we could pillage without worrying about the legal consequences.
We'll either defeat them in battle or a legion of lawyers will be killed. It's win-win.
Yes, but if we win, they have to pay our fees.
So your idea is to bore them to death?
Not the 'hostile takeover' I'm used to leading.
Because you're younger with only one hat-point.
You think the paper trail will give us away?
As it turns out, castrations, scalps and gold teeth all qualify as gross income.
ambulant chasers !
. . . and then we turn the lawyers loose, so the real pillaging can begin.
So, how did you get into mergers and acquisitions?
I don't really mind the battles; It's the regulatory compliance that's a drag.
They are conditioned to following horse's asses.
We need to stop soon. The horses need water and the lawyers may need to adjust their briefs.
I know winter is coming, but so is April 15th.
Onward to the (com)promised land !!!
Do you think we're leaving an audit trail?
This time, there will be no doubt that we mean business!
Four centuries of plunder, and now they ask for receipts.
Remember when the rules of engagement were simpler?
Attila wanted the cruelest mercenaries, I'm bringing him Congress!
We're off to sue the wizard.
Frankly, this idea seems even worse than the "Send in the Clowns" offensive.
We came, we saw, we audited.
Well, you did ask for a band of cutthroats.
I came, I sued, I conquered.
Having an acquisition army is more profitable, but I do miss hands-on plundering.
We Came, We Sued, We Conquered.
I'm telling you, Bob, he said "pursue the enemy," not "sue the enemy."
I say we put 'em all in a giant horse and leave it outside the city gate.
If you can't beat them, audit them.
Are they still back there?
Next time, click the "I AGREE" button.
I liked it better when we won with shock and awe instead of fear and loathing.
I could swear he said we'd lead the battle for 'gold and sex', not 'Goldman Sachs'.
We should have brought our boxers instead of briefs!
They're from the firm of Genghis and Khan.
I keep telling them. I don't need life insurance.
We will gain untold riches, less thirty percent of course.
I didn't sign up for this level of barbarism.
Next time, read the Terms of service.
If you say whatever suits you one more time......!
If it's a battle of wits, our guys are only half-armed.
No way they can withstand the billable hours...
They are from Goldman Saxons
His Majesty wants us to either win the battle or tie it up in the courts for years!
At the edge of the cliff, you go left, I go right.
The streets will run red with ink
Oh, they will feel the mighty wrath of Smith, Hogarth and Cheney!
At dawn, we file an injunction.
Shock and law.
Billing rate of $500 per hour... and they call us the Barbarians?
Remember when looting and pillaging was an honorable profession?
Covfefe!
I miss the days when we could raid and plunder without having to run it by the lawyers first.
It only took 200 billable hours to sack Constantinople.
I told the King not to involve H.R.
Is this their first corporate retreat?
Wait until they find out we only need two of them.
We mean business.
They have taken all the fun out of pillaging.
Legal says do NOT call it a "Crusade."
In a hostile takeover, you can never have enough lawyers.
Just once, I'd like to do a hostile takeover the old-fashioned way.
We can still loot and pillage, but we need to fill out 1099's.
Do you have ANY IDEA what this is costing us?
We Came, We Sued, We Conquered.
Didn't I tell you that the Republicans would follow me?
The idea is to bore the enemy to death.
Sir, I regret to inform you that news of the battle was leaked to the personal injury lawyers.
This time we'll settle accounts once and for all
Whaddaya mean the worst is behind us?
We should win this battle. We have the law on our side.
I miss the old days when we could just rape and pillage.
Nothing is more terrifying than an army of lawyers.
So then I say, "Barbarian? That's libel." And then HE says, 'Oh yeah, what you gonna do about it?"
It's going to be an extremely hostile takeover, mark my words!
It could be worse--I heard Kevin got stuck with the Children's Crusade.
Well ...when Khan described it, attorney general sounded so cool!
Maybe we shouldn't have sacked Washington.
No army can beat the Spanish Deposition.
I thought today was Casual Friday.
These corporate retreats get weirder every year.
This new generation of looters and pillagers...
I prefer the old way of pillaging.
You were right - we never should have conquered Wall Street.
You go to war with the army you have.
As I've always said, you don't bring a knife to a proxy fight.
Pillaging? Not so much. But, trust me, they're great at looting!
We appeal at dawn.
If we're going to sue for peace, I want to do it right.
This is going to be an audit they'll never forget
Something tells me writing the peace treaty will take longer than the war.
There may be only two of us left but we will bury them in paperwork!
I kind of miss the old horde.
It's less a crusade than a hostile takeover.
Next time be more specific when you order a thousand mercenaries."
I really thought 'army of lawyers' was just a figure of speech.
This time we mean business.
The strategy is to wear them down with discovery and subpoenas.
The princess wants an airtight prenup.
Because it turns out, there were some things a barbarian wouldn't do
Because there were no ambulances for them to chase.
Thank god we were able to find some mercenaries.
"Where is this Mar-a-Lago?
I heard it with my own ears. They fear a tax from the north.
After the pillaging comes the paperwork.
Frankly, I hope we lose.
Not at all what I expected when they appointed me Attorney General.
I like your idea about putting the associates over the wall with catapults.
Looting and pillaging just isn't the same since Dodd-Frank.
And you're sure he didn't mean Sioux?
International law has soooo ruined the crusades.
This will show Atilla that we mean business!
Please tell me these guys are on contingency
It’s 9 now. At least you know the fighting will stop at 5.
We may get slaughtered, but the hourly rate we negotiated will make us legends.
OK so how 'bout pillaging. Can we still pillage?
I think tomorrow is causal Friday
I thought you were speaking metaphorically when you said we'd need an army of lawyers.
I don't know about Brooks Brothers sponsoring the crusade.
New strategy. Follow the money.
We've drained the swamp, now what do we do with them?
First, sow confusion.
Now we get the same results, but without all the property damage.
When they answer the door, tell them it's just a routine audit.
Don’t turn around but that one with the mustache is freaking me out.
Sack one village and the paperwork will just kill you.
We'll win. We've got all their lawyers.
It's gonna take an army of lawyers to get that hateful ignorant lying greedy narcissistic dirtbag out of power.
Is it just me, or has pillaging lost its magic?
Did you read the script?

No, Ambu, lance chasers!

Ixnay on the lawyer jokes.
For the record: this is not what I meant by hostile takeover.
Do not underestimate the element of surprise.
He did say an army of lawyers, right?
So the guy's lawyer says to me "Yeah, you and who else's army?"
All I'm saying is those filthy swine better have their receipts in order.
It just seems excessively barbaric.
This is the worst Crusade yet.
Not such a bad deal - only twelve thousand lawyers for our two spies.
My father sacked Rome without a single lawyer.
Sure, the catapults will soften them up, but the fusillade of paper will bury them.

Ignore them, they're personal injury lawyers.
Don't worry. We've got the law on our side.

I miss the days when all we did was rape and pillage.
I miss the old horde!
I told you my Ted Talk would be inspiring.

Just so you know, I beheaded a guy for wearing a blazer and khakies.
I knew we shouldn't have have accepted their LinkedIn invitation.
Trust me- they're expecting arrows and swords. They'll never see the audit coming.

I hate corporate retreats.
Are you sure it's "Shock and audit"?
I called ONE lender for quote on a new mortgage....
We'll charge first. They'll charge by the hour.

I guess we are going to tax them to death.
Genghis Cohen will be quite pleased with our conquest.
I thought this was casual Friday.

The road to Hell is paved with good exemptions.
They've been following me every since I got rearended by a chariot.
I pity the enemy when the auditors get through with them.
I love fighting for a good clause.
We're gonna stipulate them to death.
Should we tell them we are lost?
I know they all went to college, but do they actually have any real skills?
Why would I ask you to get the men "suits of Armani" for the battle?
The crusade of the ambulance chasers
Let's gallop and see what happens
An team of male, white billionaires led by medieval, Machiavellian swagger--how could we possibly lose this battle?
The pen better be mightier than the sword.
Next year I'm doing estimated taxes to avoid all this.
Remember, the lawyers go into battle first. That way we'll be popular whether we win or lose.
I almost hope we lose.
That's the last time we pillage the 5:14 to Stamford!
Ever since we switched from Vikings to lawyers, no one wants to take us on.
We used to be savage, now we're ruthless.
To sue your rivals. See them driven to bankruptcy. Hear the lamentations of their shareholders.
The troops are looking forward to Casual Friday.
You can tell them that the librarians are at the gates.
If you're gonna pillage, you gotta lawyer up.
It's going to be a hostile takeover.
Pillaging was much more fun before legal got involved.
The hardest thing to get right in battle is the liability waiver.
They say all of those purses are filled with fearsome weapons called "subpoenas."
I can't go any slower! Why don't they just pass us ??
I miss being above the law.
And I thought our uniforms were bad.
Well, scorched earth leads to a lot of litigation.
An early example of ambulance chasing.
Let's see them break through my legal defense.
They heard that there will be an ambulance on site.
You heard the orders, "No more working from home! Round 'em up and bring 'em in!"
Why do personal injury lawyers always follow us?
This will be a brief battle.
I always get uncomfortable when the ambulance chasers follow us into battle.
Are you sure you told that consultant that we wanted to "liquidate" our enemies, and not "litigate" them?
Who knew? An army of lawyers gets me so much more than weapons ever did.
If you can't beat 'em, sue 'em.
Couldn't we have just signed a waiver?
There'd damn well better be a fortune in beans to count.
They'll do things slaves won't do and the King isn't all that attached to them.
You destroy ONE tiny village and all of a sudden you've got 1000 insurance claims on your hands...
I sure hope both sides got the same memo.
Remember when they were ambulance chasers?

It's the sequel: Game of Drones
Veni, vidi, sued the bastards.
I understand that in the future they will be referred to as Ambulance Chasers.
I was okay with the flaming arrows. I even understood the plague-infected rats. All I'm saying is that sending in lawyers seems a bit over the top.
A gig's a gig, but I do think this is going to be the worst 'Hobbit' movie yet.
...then, at the first signs of their surrender, we send in our closers.
Remember, You turn left and I'll turn right... and they will continue over the cliff.

I really hate these post plunder audits.
Weekend warriors my ass.
Surrender, or be audited!

If you can't beat them in battle, bill them by the hour.
You would be surprised how much damage and destruction economists can cause.
Game of drones. Season one.
I thought we'd try boring the enemy to death!
Do they really still think this is a corporate retreat?
I got to wondering why use force to expand the empire when we can just do it via mergers and acquisitions?
Of course they don't fear hell. They're FROM hell!
They’re here to help us monetize the barbaric,
I bet when we said we'd bring an army of lawyers they thought we were being figurative.
It will be the greatest bureaucratic empire the world has ever known.
Did he say 'kill all the lawyers or all the accountants'??
Just so you know, I had a guy flogged for wearing a blazer and khakies.
Lawyers are expensive and not great warriors but I like their total lack of mercy.
They say the streets are paved with loopholes.

I'll give you ten to one odds this case will settle.
I'd rather have huns too, but attorneys were the only expendable troops we could get.
I know we wanted a brief battle, but this is ridiculous.
They only march from 9 to 5.
Supposedly they're great at pillaging.
God I miss the fight. Now it's just lawyer them to death.
It's the perfect Supreme Court decision for a post-industrial and globalized capitalism that emphasizes making money off of political power plays and exploitation of public resources rather than the competitive production of goods and services.
I hate legal battles.
"First, kill all the lawyers," sounds good, but who knew it would require so much paperwork?
Rape and pillage are fine as far as they go, but nothing drops them to their knees like an audit.
But what if we're not an accident waiting to happen?
I miss the old days.
I'll teach Hammurabi a thing or two about codes.
War's a lot less fun than it used to be.

A hostile takeover ain't what it used to be.
The king called for full court press.
We will strike mild irritation into their hearts!
We came, we saw, we sued.
If we don’t win we don’t pay.
A thousand years from tomorrow's victory all they will remember are the billable hours.
I don't think this orgy is going to be as much fun as the last one.
I said I wanted suits of mail, not males in suits.
As soon as they start in with the catapults, we'll hit them with attempted manslaughter.
We'll see who discovered America first.
I'm confident we can mount a vigorous defense.
How we going to get them back by five?
They all have MBAs. They have no more idea where they’re going than we do
We’re merciless? Wait until you see their hourly fees.
The Saracens will rue the day they took on Barstow, Wiggins, Fenucci & Clarke.
We got a deal on them – used to work for the EPA.

What do we do? I'll tell you what we do. We tell the Emperor that these ARE the Barbarians. Period. And for God's sake, do not mention Rotarians. The last thing we need is another plumber / plunder incident.

Flatulence chasers.
He is a cunning enemy and I fear he may countersue.
They say that in Europe it was a piper who used to do this.

If we survive, I am to make partner.
