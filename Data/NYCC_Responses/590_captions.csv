He did my summer cave in Lascaux, too.
Well, he can kiss his security deposit goodbye.
Sure, drawing it is the easy part, it's the caption that's tough.
It will be worth even more when he's extinct.
The way he tells it, we come out looking like a couple of Neanderthals.
We're totally taking credit for this later, right?
No one will believe this, not in a million years.
YOU tell him not to write on the walls.
Will the day ever come when you can just have a meal without posting it?
Nobody would believe that in a million years.
I get he's an artist. It's the 'in residence' part I'm not comfortable with.
You distract him with gentle criticism about his use of perspective and meager color palette while I club him from behind.
It's a New Yorker cartoon. Just laugh and act like you get it.
If that's a menu, we're in trouble.
Face it. You are that hairy.
They're not going to believe this in a million years!
For our sake, I hope he's not a starving artist.
I don't know, it seems primitive to me.
If it's a grocery list we're in trouble
Still want to brag about your handprint?
They go extinct, we take the credit, no one's the wiser.
Let's see--the specials today are bison, fish, and...uh-oh.
You go first; I'm the gatherer.
I prefer his Paleolithic period.
As long as they don't find out he invented the wheel, we're fine.
Why does he have to post everything he does to his wall?
Sure he can draw, but can he do captions?
He calls it, 'The Last Supper.'
If you ask me, his Jurassic period was better
They'll never believe this in a million years!
You were supposed to teach him 'fetch,' not 'sketch'.
He changes the menu daily. It's all locally sourced.
Liberal arts are a dead end. The future is hunting and gathering.
They say his art will be worth a lot more after he's extinct.
The worst part is someday they'll say we did that.
Paints like Picasso but tastes like chicken.
They'll never believe this! Not in a million years!
You know, once those pictures get posted they're there forever...
His technique is really evolving.
He knows he's going to lose his security deposit, right?
First he invents the wheel; now this. It's embarrassing.
Let me guess, you didn't invent the wheel either.
Yeah, but it makes the room look dated.
His work is still evolving...
Just remember, he doesn't do well with criticism.
Think how much they'll be worth when he's extinct.
And this is the drawing room.
Critics are calling his work 'evolutionary.'
He's not extinct, but he is passé.
OK, now you’ve seen the underground scene. Want to go clubbing?
No, YOU tell him not to draw on the walls.
That's definitely Skrag on the bottom, so we can stop searching for him.
We have to seriously step it up if we want to become the dominant species.
The upside is after he's extinct they'll be priceless.
I love his whimsical juxtaposition of Jurassic and Pleistocene species
They say talent like his only comes around every billion years or so.
Somehow it's primitive yet derivative.
I never knew they had such sensitive, intelligent souls. You want the white meat or the dark?
He's a great artist but he also ate my wife so...my opinion is mixed.
I've never seen a crayonasaurus rex in action!
Draws like Picasso, but tastes like chicken.
They won't believe this in a million years.
The moment he goes extinct the value will triple
But is it art?
Normally, I would just bludgeon and eat him but I'm dying to see how the story ends.
Of course he agreed to a 50% commission. He's got a brain the size of a walnut.
Imagine what he could do if he had thumbs.
We are SO not that hairy... but those long pointy stick things seem like a great idea
Me, not so much, but he really nailed you.
When he's extinct, they'll be worth a fortune.
I'm worried it might be a menu.
Uh oh, I think that's his grocery list.
I'm more concerned about him standing on two feet.
If the dinosaurs keep up this whole "art as a career" thing, they'll be wiped out in no time.
They'll never guess this in a million years.
Looks a little primitive if you ask me.
I much prefer his Jurassic Period.
Oh no, you go first - I’m not the one who wrote his last show was “primitive deconstruction fit only for the reptilian brain.”
Pre-modernism.
I prefer his earlier work.
No one's gonna believe us in a million years!
Look, if 'you could do that' you would have done it, okay?
Not yet, I want to see how he ends it.
When he's extinct we can take credit for this.
Oh, great! This one keeps a food diary.
He posts way too much on his wall.
So _that's_ what those little arms are for.
If he starts drawing two guys with clubs, run like hell.
I know it's the last one, but I'm pretty hungry.
If he invites you in to see his etchings, don't go.
And all these years I thought it was you.
You watch: He'll only get famous when he's extinct.
After we eat him, I’m signing that.
There goes our security deposit.
They're going to be even more valuable when he's extinct.
It'll be worth more once he's extinct.
My left brain says to kill and eat him, but my right brain says I should hire him to paint my den.
I told you to teach him to fetch, but, noooo, you said, let him express himself.
He could have been a great hunter-gatherer, but you let him go to that damn liberal arts school
We need to invent the door.
His work hasn't fully evolved yet.
Let's try another place. Something about the menu here makes me uncomfortable.
I know it's expensive. But these days you just can't sell a cave without home staging.
I just don't get modern art.
Am I really that fat?
It's your cave, YOU tell him his perspective is all wrong.
He's in his Jurassic period.
You know they’re going to blame us for this, right?
Yet when I try to house break him, he acts like he can't understand a thing.
I called them prehistoric and I thought he was going to bite my head off.
Why does he always make me look fat?
Its another damn Interiordecorasauris.
Damn... we're still on the menu.
It's a bit primitive, don't you think?
Impressive yes, but is it art?
My wife wanted to go with a floral motif, but I said “Not in my man cave.”
Careful. He's already eaten one art critic.
Big whoop. It's not like he invented the wheel.
See? They are taking all of our jobs. We need to make the Stone Age Great Again.
After he's extinct, it could be worth a fortune.
We're lucky we found him. Craftsmen who can do this type of work are practically extinct.
You told me you drew those. What else have you been lying about?
Hold up, I want to see how the story ends!!
I liked his Jurassic period better.
He's going to evolve into a thesaurus.
You club him. We add a couple of hand prints. It'll be huge.
Yeah, but once that asteroid hits, we’ll get all the credit.
My instinct is to kill him and take all the credit.
Most people train their pet to hunt, Brian
So annoying. He won't eat anything without posting a picture of it.
As usual, we're going to get blamed for this!
There he goes again—spreading fake news!
I admit, the work has a certain primitive appeal to it.
We didn’t really discover fire, either.
He's pretty good but he has no perspective.
He's been drawing me fatter since I made that extinction joke.
He's good, but he'll never be discovered.
Sure he's a monster, but you have to separate the art from the artist.
We're gonna take credit for this, right?
We decided to go Primitive with the front foyer, and then Contemporary for the den.
His work is really evolving.
It has the pretensions of the Cretaceous period, but we all know he's stuck in the Jurassic.
Great, now we'll never sell this place.
Dave, its like watching a Weinstein film. Can you really separate the art from the predator that made it?
Frankly, everything after his Triassic Period has been rather jejune.
Do you think he made me look fat?
These drawings would be worth a lot more if he were to "accidentally go extinct".
Random selection my ass.
The critics are all saying that once they’re extinct, it will really be worth something.
Here's the plan: we discover fire, cook him medium rare, and take credit for the art.
I was also impressed until I realized he’s menu planning.
You know who's gonna get blamed for this
He’s painting his “Last Supper”.
We're losing control of the narrative.
After he shows you how to start a fire, I say we club him and we take the credit for this too.
My kid's dinosaur could do that.
When a Cretaceous artist tries to go all Cenozoic, it never quite works.
Do I really look like that from behind?
No, YOU tell him it's too derivative!
I think it's way better than that novel the chimpanzee wrote.
Try explaining cultural appropriation to a dinosaur.
He's allowed up to 140 characters. This is going to take awhile...
Nice, but you know it's going to cost us an arm and a leg!
I hear he also does great work in bronze, whatever that is.
Just so you know, she's not known to respond very well to criticism.
Your critique is fair; I just don't think he's really looking for feedback right now.
He's in his Jurassic period.
I have a bad feeling that he's evolving faster than we are.
I like his early work better.
Yeah, she's good, but last year it was ballet lessons and before that, the violin.
Darwin is not going to like this.
Personally, I think it's kind of primitive.
Suddenly I feel less evolved.
I don't know much about art, but I know what I like to eat.
That will never come off the wall, and I'm sure we'll get blamed for it.
..and who do you think they'll believe in 65 million years?
Nobody will believe it in a million years.
Don’t worry; the archeologists will say we did it!
Remember: we did the paintings, and the dinosaurs died 65 million years ago.
No, wait until he finishes. Then we take credit for it.
You're the fat one.
Okay! You say art and I say vandalism. Can we both agree it's dinner?
You got the decorator in without consulting me?
His work is derivative, lacks perspective, and anti-paleontological, but it sells.
It's a cold-blooded commentary on modern hunter-gatherer culture.
I'm finding that real artistic talent is almost extinct.
Is my back really that hairy?
This is going to play hell with evolution theory.
I say we kill him, eat him, and take credit for the art work.
Picassosaurus.
Don't worry. We'll get credit for it.
He's prolific. He works like he's going extinct tomorrow or something.
If we kill him now they'll just call us art critics.
I saw his work at an exhibit of post-extinctionism at the Lascaux last year.
Sure, he can paint. But can he stand criticism?
Art therapy helps him face extinction.
Inside it's art, outside it's graffiti. Go figure.
When it's all said and done, I bet we get the blame for this .
ANOTHER Graffitisaurus !!
He's ahead of what time?
Your the one who wanted to domesticate it. I said we should have just eaten it.
So we're agreed, no more LSD at Burning Man.
opposable thumbs, my ass
Meh. He stopped evolving as an artist years ago.
And this will be the baby's room!
His first love was the piano, but his hands were too small to reach all the keys.
There goes our deposit.
A million years from now, we're going to get blamed for this.
My kid could do that.
I thought you said these were YOUR paintings...
Sure they're talented, but guess who gets the credit when they become extinct?
It’ll be worth more after he’s extinct.
It’s a Picassosaurus.
YOU tell him it doesn’t go with the sofa.
In his stories the animals always win.
All this self-absorbed social media stuff will be the end of the dinosaurs.
The wife insisted we get an interior designer.
Now don't forget what happened to his last critic.
The reviews say he's way ahead of his time.
Let's wait. I want to see how the story ends.
And you didn't invent the wheel either, did you?
You tell him he's extinct.
Four years of art school for what?
I guess we owe the kids an apology.
It's just so terribly derivative of that stuff in France.
What kind of Neanderthal uses oil instead of acrylic?
Once he’s ‘extinct’ the value will soar.
Odd for a thesaurus not to put a caption.
Just our luck, a Graffitisaurus.
They’re evolving faster than we thought. That’s burnt charcoal.
I said fetch, not sketch
It's a bit wordy, but the story is quite compelling
OMG it's a menu!
He reinterprets events from the perspective of the prey. It’s all very modern.
I see Rex is finally using his tiny hands for something good.
I don't think anyone will be interested in this kind of art 100 years from now.
It's a pictosaurus
You couldn't just teach him how to fetch?
I could do that
Confirmed - He ate your two brothers.
JUST GREAT !! Now I have to repaint the living room, again !
I always love hunting new talent.
I liked his Jurassic period better.
The rumors were right. We are on the menu.
Is that really what I look like?
No opposable thumbs and he still wins "Best in Show" every year.
I say we let him finish.
Big deal--he still poops on the lawn, doesn't he?
YOU tell him not to write on the walls.
I really should start keeping a food diary, too.
I don't care what he does as long as he pays the rent.
I think those are tonight's dinner specials.
Yeah, right. Like he ever caught a pterodactyl!
Was it your idea to have an artist in residence?
Wife’s idea. I just wanted nice blue walls.
Yeah, but can he make fire?
Oh sure, the art's great, but try getting him to use the litter box.
It would be a real shame to silence such talent, but I'm really hungry.
We'll probably get blamed for this.
After we eat him we can take credit for them.
He's just my touch up guy. Creative control is still totally mine.
I say we wait until he's finished. He's the last of his kind, after all.
Let's move on. It might be his grocery list.
He just doodles on a wall, then he expects US to come up with a brilliant caption.
I hope the historians won't think that we painted that junk.
You wanted to domesticate it, now it thinks it owns the place.
No, YOU tell him his figures are merely two-dimensional.
It will be very valuable once he is extinct
I prefer his Pleistocene Period.
It's that dang graffitauras again!
I used to like it here, but they keep changing the menu.
I'll bet, thousands of years from now they'll think we did this.
They like to mark their territory.
I thought you said the painter would be done by the time we got home from vacation
Sure, his technique is good, but his style is derivative.
I hope that is not a menu.
Just sign your name...in a million years no one will know the difference!
First fire...now this?
I'm thinking of switching from hunting-and-gathering and moving into collecting.
It’s not art, these are his dinner choices...
Interesting idea. Pictures last longer if you don't draw them in the dirt.
I thought we agreed on wall paper.
Yuk. People are gonna believe WE drew them !!
We can take the credit when they become extinct
I say we eat him first, then take credit for his work.
Makes me feel even more like a Neanderthal.
Last week it was pottery. I mean, pick a major already.
His work won't stand the test of time.
I’m not THAT hairy.
Good forgers like him are nearly extinct.
I told you short-term renters would ruin the place.
You tell him it's not what you had in mind.
Am I that fat?
He said he works for the New Yorker and wants us to submit the captions.
The writing is on the wall, it is either him or us.
Don't wimp out on me now, Grog, it's a double win. We become the dominant species and get credit for the art.
Way too representational for my taste.
Brock posed for him earlier, but now we can’t find him.
He calls it his "Paleo Diet."
Like anyone is ever going to see his work.
We can take credit after he's extinct.
You know we're going to get blamed for this...
Of course you could have done that but you didn’t did you?
If this is a shopping list, we're in big trouble
Of course, we'll repaint after moving in.
The Paleo Diet Cookbook, 1st Edition.
Sure, he has evolved as an artist, but as a species?
If we club him now, we can pass it off as our own.
The dude may have talent but he has no future.
Trust me, the wall adds 10 pounds. You look fine, Steve.
More fake news.
Who knows what it means, but it keeps him busy.
I thought you said they were done by aliens.
He's doing my cave after he's finished with Barry's.
His use of charcoal imparts a contemporary yet somehow timeless quality
That's an interesting perspective the way he's drawn us upright.
It keeps him from chewing on the furniture.
Utter genius! These guys are going to rule the earth forever.
So he’s the one spreading rumors about us!
You try to keep a nice cave and before you know it there's graffiti all over the walls.
But is it art?
The best talent of a generation. Almost a shame to eat him.
You want to be the one to tell him his work lacks imagination?
The value of his cave paintings will skyrocket once he's extinct.
I was hoping for something a bit more post-mesozoic
Don't call her a "dinosaur artist" -- she prefers just "artist."
He calls them Emojis.
After the extinction, it'll be priceless.
I thought representational art was extinct.
Should we tell him that's not a survival skill, or let history run it's course?
I find his style really primitive.
I've told him a million times—you're as good as dead with an art degree in this job market.
I don't get modern art.
Considering the lack of opposable thumbs, it ain’t bad.
He can draw, but can he make fire?
The menu here is locally sourced.
Don't worry, we're white men. We'll end up getting the credit.
The prospect of mass extinction really brings out his creative side.
Let's go with wallpaper.
Just a bit too primitive for my taste
After he's done, we'll sneak in and trace our handprints all over it. A million years from now, guess who'll get the credit.
I also own some works from his Paleolithic period.
Keeping track of what he eats helps him stay on his diet
Let's call it "Art Gecko."
Well, now we know where Zog and Zum went.
You let that egg hatch, didn't you?
Let him discover how to make fire. Then I'll be impressed.
They’ll be worth a lot more after he’s extinct.
It'll be worth more after his extinction.
Reservations or not, if that's the menu I am leaving.
I don't want to be around when his mother comes home.
I guess we know what happened to Frank...
I thought they were extinct, but apparently they've just been focusing on their art.
They'll be trying to figure this out for years.
I've hired him to do my place in France.
I hate to tell him he's got no future.
the best part is that 20,000 years from now critics will think you and I were the geniuses that painted this
Let him live. Years from now they will think we did it.
He's in his post-extinction phase.
He paints what he eats.
My kid could do that.
Too primitive for my taste.
I thought figurative painters were all pretty much extinct!
Don't worry, I'll see to it that we get the credit.
We're keeping his security deposit.
You told me those were your drawings.
Not bad, though I'm no fan of modern art.
I was hoping for some nudes.
That's the easy part. Now we have to come up with a witty caption.
Like his art will ever be noticed a million years from now
Don't confuse the quality of the art with your feelings about the artist.
His background is paleolithic, but you get the feeling that the neolithic age is trying to break through.
Actually, it's his menu.
It is a chart of all its major food groups
That's so sixty-five-million-years-ago.
You know theyre going to pin this on us.
Is this fine for you or shall we look at the menu next door?
They'll be worth more when he's dead.
It's a shame he won't be appreciated until after he's extinct.
He's almost too talented to eat.
It's a little primitive, but you know, I like it.
He loves making the weekly grocery list.
No-o-o, YOU tell him his work is derivative.
I know.... but when he dies they'll be worth millions.
You know who's gonna get blamed for this
We will never get our deposit back, now!
We can't let them control the narrative.
I always wondered what those short little arms are for.
No, you tell him there should only be one moon.
If anyone finds this it's going to make us look like a bunch of "Neanderthals"!
I don’t know how they think they’re going to survive as artists.
We may not be the most intelligent but we got clubs.
Dinosaurs are so primitive - That doesn't even look like us.
I told you not to leave him alone. That will never come off.
Oh, come on. I bet he hasn't eaten half those guys.
Plagiasaurus!
Last week it was this Italian woman, enigmatic smile.
I told you not to enroll him in Head Start.
They come here, they take our jobs...
Studio assistant. The ideas are mine.
Just think about how much those are going to be worth once he's extinct.
Oh, Great! Now my wife’s gonna want to hire a decorator, too!
You wanted a pet - you clean up after it.
He says it's called "Premodern".
I know you love it, but I live here too.
He was a cartoonist for the New Yorker back when its cartoons were funny.
Just think how much his stuff will be worth after he's extinct!
His paintings won't sell for a million years.
When he becomes extinct, this stuff will be worth a fortune.
If you're asking me, it's a dying art form.
I'm hungry, too, but the art man, the art!
We're totally taking credit for this.
I don't eat at restaurants where I'm on the menu.
I'd be more impressed if he knew we only had one moon.
Oh really, Mr. Art Critic? You think it's 'primitive'?
YOU do something. YOU'RE the one who said they were extinct.
I hate modern art.
Let's see what's on today's menu.
I prefer his Jurassic period.
They're illustrations for a book he's writing called Genesis.
It's fake news.
So? They still taste like chicken.
Season 1 was better.
I can't stand modern art.
He's evolving as an artist, but I don't think he has a future.
This would be easier for me if the art was no good.
He can be temperamental. Last week, he ate Grunella after she criticized his use of negative space.
I'm not that hairy, am I?
They say the value goes up after the artist's extinction.
He draws what he ate. Now we know what happened to Thurg and Glook.
It looks like his Jurassic Period.
Sure, the style is Jurassic. But drawing with charcoal? This guy is way ahead of his time.
Sure it's primitive but it'll be worth a fortune in ten or twenty thousand years.
Refreshingly primitive, like he has direct access to his reptile brain.
He'll never get his deposit back.
The vet said it was good therapy.
It won’t be worth anything until after he’s extinct.
If you ask me, his Jurassic period work was better
Who knew that the inventor of "fake news" was a creepy guy with small hands, scales and a tail?
See what you can accomplish when you stand on your own two feet.
He's made a living plagiarizing our work.
It really does spruce up the place, but he charges an arm and a leg.
YOU tell him it's primitive.
Boy, I hope no one ever thinks we did that!
We’re gonna get blamed for this.
Well, that pretty much destroys your 'opposable thumb' theory..
Am I really that hairy?
Let's see how this evolves.
Genius or not, I'm still hungry.
He updates the menu daily
So what? My five year old could do that.
I hate modern art.
First he prices us out of our cave, now he appropriates our culture?
It's not his evolution as an artist that I'm concerned about.
You'd be wise to keep your "a little too primitive" to yourself.
Until he adds captions, I'm not worried.
You know we’re going to get the blame for this don’t you?
If it's so easy, you go and tell him he's got no sense of perspective.
A Plagerasauras if I ever saw one.
You know we'll get blamed for it eventually.
Yes, the style is exuberantly primitive to be sure , but it still smacks of a certain subtextual pretentiousness...
I know, but he's very good with the children.
Do you think that's what we really look like?
So he's artistic. That doesn't mean he's gay.
We can always paint over it if you don't like it.
He just posted and already has more likes than me.
And you said nothing would ever come of his fine arts degree.
"Oh, oh! Our food sources are evolving faster than we are!
Do you think we'll ever be able to stand on just our back legs?
He calls it a 'Tasting Menu'.
Let's kill him and take all the credit.
No Neanderthal, it primitive art.
Relax. It's not like in a million years anyone will care who drew them.
They'll think WE drew this crap, you know. We'll be a laughingstock for eons.
Good... but not great. Want to hit another cave, or should we get brunch?
He'll need us to come up with the captions.
Let him draw. They'll still think we did it.
It's bad enough that they eat our kids, but do they have to vandalize our homes as well?
These graffiti hooligans are so cold-blooded.
Totally fake news...pterodactyls are extinct.
He's ahead of his time.
Good? I'll say. He's actually left handed.
I'm conflicted...my wife wants it out of the house, but the artwork is exquisite.
Am I that fat?
Me waiting until he all done. Then me binge watch entire wall.
I told you Cave-bnb was a bad idea.
We better get out of here - he's creating a menu.
So primitive.
He said something about 'primitivism.' I never understand him.
Who let the Picassosarus loose?
You know we're going to get blamed for this, right?
I guess we could hire a lawyer and sue him for encroaching upon our intellectual property. Or we could just eat him.
I prefer the Pre-Reptilites.
Maybe a little too primitive?
Looks like that the asteroid missed one of them.
He’s the greatest painter, ever. Of course, we’re still in the Stone Age.
You just had to teach him how to stand on his hind legs, didn't you!
Soon as he leaves, let's sign it
Yeah, but in 12,000 years who’s going to remember him?
He won't really be appreciated until after he's extinct.
It's his early charcoals that I find wildly primitive and engaging...
I really don't like where this story is going
It's good, but a bit derivative.
After extinction, we'll take the credit.
In 10,000 years we'll get the credit.
You distract him with a critique of Post-Neolithic realism; I'll hit him on the head.
I say it's gentrification and I say we kill him.
Well there goes our security deposit on this place
I'd ask him to leave but he's a really great decorator.
See what happens when they start walking upright....
This is what happens when you drain the swamp.
Next comes the espresso bars, and then before you know it we’re paying double our rent for the same old cave.
Those are today's specials.
The landlord will blame this on us.
Don't worry, the wall adds 10 pounds.
Or do you prefer wallpaper?
I prefer his earlier work.
First he wants credit for fire, and now this.
I can't believe she left you for an artist.
It’s a primitive form of communication called “emojis.”
Dino is good artist--I say club him and take credit.
I think it's art; you think it's a recipe.
Oh no, a Doodlesaurus.
He said he would put us above the theropods.
That’s going to be worth a fortune once he’s extinct.
His choice of medium may be inspired but his subjects are rather primitive.
Be careful, he's a starving artist.
There goes another theory.
Well now, he's just rewriting history.
Interest in cave art is at prehistoric levels.
The only thing that could possibly stop these graffiti artists is a giant asteroid.
That's Leezarde, my intern...she does all my drawings while I go out clubbing.
I tried it, but my thumbs kept getting in the way.
Wow, so THAT's what Banksy looks like!
He's just adding details. Says our work is too primitive.
I knew it ! He's using CaveBook to influence the election.
He's way ahead of his time.
Let him finish, I hate cliffhangers.
If he doesn't develop a better sense of perspective he's not going to survive.
That's a Picassosaurus.
If we eat him now, think of how much we can get for his last cave paintings.
Yes he's very talented, but if he starts singing 'I love you, you love me,' club him.
They're gonna be worth a fortune when he goes extinct.
Art therapy is part of his anger management program.
He just got back from a field trip to France.
I told her we're absolutely not hiring an interior decorator...then I caved.
First fire, then the wheel. Now this? It's time to change the narrative.
Anachronistic and unevolved if you ask me, but I'm no art critic.
Don't let the talent fool you, he's still a cold-blooded killer.
Not only are they not extinct, but this one got a grant!
It looks like we're on the menu this week.
So much for your premise that 'art makes us human'.
Those will be worth a lot when the artist is extinct.
Modern art makes no sense.
Ok, same plan as last time. We club him then take credit for the art.
All we have to do is knock him out, claim his work and we'll be famous
When he's extinct, they'll be worth a fortune.
He's a creationist
I say we eat him and fake the provenance.
I don't think we're really that hairy.
Watercolors are so Middle Pleistocene.
No, we're not looking for velociraptors with good taste; we're looking for ones that taste good.
You know they're going to blame it on us.
Tell the others, we finally found Banksy.
They'll be much more valuable after we eat him
I have a feeling we're going to get blamed for this.
He said he's a "Creationist"
My original thought was something from the Mesozoic in the living room but I'm so glad the painter suggested a contemporary.
We're lucky she came along. Our other decorator just disappeared on us.
There is no earlier work
We gotta stop leaving the door open.
Just edit your privacy settings and he won't be able to comment on your wall anymore.
Don't worry, it'll wash right off.
Okay, that is not at all how it went down
True, but I bought him as a hunting dog
"His first love was graffiti but he couldn't spell".
Mystery solved.
Uh uh. Not me. YOU tell him the contest deadline was yesterday.
It's just one more thing they're going to blame on us.
So what separates us from the animals now?
I really think we ate the wrong mushrooms again.
Believe it or not, this work will be attributed to us
When he's done just sign it. In a million years who'll know the difference?
maybe its not true that history is written by the winners
I bet we get blamed for this.
He says a picture is worth a thousand words, whatever that means.
Maybe a 'meet and greet' the artist isn't such a great idea.
I don’t know; it seems kind of primitive.
If you think those are good, you should see his abstracts.
Don’t the victors write the history books
If this gets out, we're done.
He says he needs to be able to express himself if he's to evolve. What the hell is "evolve" anyway?
Hopefully he's not a starving artist
Is it graffiti, or is it art? The lines are so blurred anymore.
A million years from now they'll probably be worth a fortune!
If my wife asks, I drew them.
After the meteor, they'll think it was us.
“It references the grandeur of the terrain outside whilst subtly commenting on the classic dichotomy of the mind and the soul in the struggle for consciousness at the nexus of life and death....”.
Don't worry. We'll get the credit.
OMG... more Fake News!
That dinosaur's as good as dead--can't you see the writing on the wall?
I thought YOU locked the door.
I just know we're going to get blamed for this
It eats what it draws. Let's vamoose.
Does my beard really look like that?
When I asked, she muttered something about the first illustrated cookbook.
Pretty primitive if you ask me.
His Cretaceous Period is a bit derivative
I hope no one ever thinks we drew that stuff.
Art is done by the winners. Let's club him and sign the wall.
That's this week's menu
Aramaic? Linear B, you troglodyte.
In 40,000 years no one will care about the cartoonasauris.
I told you sending him to a liberal arts school was a mistake.
I hate it when they try to rewrite history.
Yeah, but he can't build a fire.
In about 6 million years, we’ll be able to do that.
Just be thankful he hasn't learned to tweet yet.
Ars longa, vita brevis.
It's part of his court-ordered community service.
Bide your time. He doesn't know diddly-squat about copyright.
He won't be laughing when the meteor hits next week.
In cave painting no one knows you're a dinosaur.
I"LL WAIT OUTSIDE WHILE YOU EXPLAIN HIS LEASE PROHIBITS WALL DECORATIONS.
He calls the wall The Menu, whatever that means.
Never disturb him while he is working or he'll bite your head off!
Don't worry, their kind will go extinct before us. We'll take the credit when they're gone.
Me like saurrealism.
Sure, it's looks nice on the wall, but Primitivism is so Paleozoic.
Don't worry, we'll get the credit. He's going extinct.
Best call the exterminator. It's an artist colony.
I'm starving for an artist.
So that's what he does while we're at work.
We’ll get credit for all of it. So, why stop him?
So they didn't go extinct --- they just retired and took up painting.
He said this will be hilarious in about 18,000 years?
"The listing reads, 'Rural appeal, historic charm and original detailing'. I think we should go in and take a look".
Not in a million years will anyone believe this is how it was.
That menu looks incredible! What time do they open?
Why didn’t we think of that.
The critics were right. Representational art is going the way of the dinosaur.
Once he's extinct, we rake in the royalties!
Just remember, we discovered fire.
It's a Picassoraptor.
He keeps score?
What's wrong with this picture?
We're probably going to get blamed for that.
He's in his primitive phase.
The menu changes daily
I've always admired his Cretaceous Period.
It’s so two dimensional.
i call it a sketchasurous
If we strike now we will forever be lost to history
I knew it! He's trying to control the narrative!
I'll admit those are better than our hand-prints.
I don't mind the artwork but I object to him teaching the kids Creationism!
If I'm reading this right, looks like he ate Joe.
I don’t care. It’s still derivative.
Wait until he's extinct, then sell the cave.
I find his work to be a tad anachronistic.
It's a Sketchasaurus.
I prefer his Late Cretaceous period.
His style is so evolved.
If this gets out it changes everything.
My wife calls it interior decorating, but I know smut when I see it.
Keep it to yourself. Apparently he also invented fire – and the wheel.
Picassosaurus.
Aren't we supposed to evolve first?
I got a hunch that we're going to get credit for this.
You know who’s going to get blamed for all this graffiti, don’t you?
I picked him up from outside Cave Depot
Whaddaya think? Have dinner or patronize the arts?
You just know they'll blame this on us.
His art isn't evolving.
My five-year old could do that.
Remember, my cousin's here with his vacation pictures, so be nice.
Just say we did it, who's he gonna tell?
Like I said, his Late Cretaceous stuff was much edgier.
I thought getting him house broken was tough, now this.
Do you want to tell him how it ends?
I don't undestand Modern Art.
Just be careful, there are a lot of predators in this business.
Since we had him spayed, he's become so artistic.
We've got to stop teaching evolution in schools.
Just think what it will be worth after he's extinct!
They say he's ahead of his time.
Yes, but is it art?
If you ask me, it lacks perspective.
He is talented but I say we kill him anyway.
...but I told her, "No frilly flowers--it's a mancave!"
Do you notice there are no vegetables on the menu?
So now we know what happened to Ernie and Bob.
I told you, Frank, the writing is on the wall for these dinosaurs.
My wife just couldn't leave it at "sit" and "stay".
It's rather primitive.
That's not art, it's his diet plan.
Its the dreaded sketchsaurus....lets try to draw him out of the cave
He's good, cheap and we get to eat him when he's finished.
I don't care if it's clever, graffiti is NOT art!
I told you it wasn't me adding the moustaches.
His parents begged him to go to law school
The menu looks pretty good. Shall we give it a try?
Looks like he is changing the menu again.
I think we'll get credit for it. I mean who would believe this?
I told you....They're gonna take our jobs!
He's not bad. Name is Renoirasaur.
A loser species in a loser profession. Sad.
His Jurassic period is still my favorite
I think you owe your son an apology.
Uh oh, I think that's his grocery list.
A million years from now, they'll think we drew it.
Yes, it is amazing AND amusing, but is it really art?
Let's see if he can find a job after college.
They'll never guess what those tiny arms were REALLY for...
The therapist said this would help with his eating issues.
Best summer intern we've had so far.
And people said his art degree wouldn't pay off.
Can't you see the handwriting on the wall? He's not really pet material.
His drawings will be worth even more once he's extinct.
Why do you assume the fatter one is me?
He's amazing but I'm hungry.
You bash him, I'll sign our names, and we'll let history do the rest.
So primitive.
Pterrible.
He's the last one. When they're all gone, no one will know our stuff is derivative.
Oh, great. Now our work is just going to seem derivative.
Wait. It'll be worth more when he's dead.
Great. Now everybody is going to think WE did it.
I love his work! It's so primitive!
Oh, great - a taggersaurus.
He calls it a "menu."
I may not know art but I know what I don't like
Let him keep going. We'll take credit when he leaves.
The value is going to skyrocket once he's extinct.
Years from now, we'll be blamed for this.
I just know we're going to get the blame for this
Enough binge-watching, let's eat!
72 hours until the asteroid hits and he's wasting time drawing stick figures.
Oh sure, he’s a talented artist, all right. But he just refuses to evolve.
Impressive... but rather primitive.
Well, of course he's more talented. He has an extinct advantage.
Sure, he's good. He had a billion years head start.
Why am I the one who always comes off looking like a Neanderthal?
I think he's a Piccassaur.
You can tell by the pterodactyl it's fake news.
Why didn’t we think of that.
Topical, yes, but his work has no depth.
Look who thinks he's Van Grok....
You tell him we want more fish ... and be firm.
He's evolved as an artist.
And...he also got a MacArthur genius grant
Are we really that hairy?
Kill, eat, draw... poor, simple-minded wretch.
His radical performances blur interspecies boundaries.
We should really install a lock... and a door.
He’s just trying to draw us in. Don’t fall for it.
I’m pretty sure it’s a tagasaurus.
What a waste of time, no one would care about this in a million years.
Someday, somebody is going to think we did this.
This is why I don't like to rent to their kind.
I’m never sure if he’s recording our extinction or his.
He showed up this morning, said he was an interior decorator. I figured what the heck ...the place could use a little sprucing up.
This time you club and I sign.
His stuff is refreshingly unironic, but it's marred by a distinct lack of sociocultural context.
Trust me; an artist's work is always worth more after they die.
I could do that
He’s done the cartoon; I think we’re supposed to supply the caption.
I hate the way the eyes follow you round the room.
At least he's evolved from marking his territory with pee!
He's helping with the staging of my place for Sunday's Open Cave.
You married UP, dude.
All that without opposable thumbs.
Now do you believe in evolution?
If he wants to be remembered, he has to ditch that pretentious Latin name.
If you like primitive art, he's the guy.
Whoever finds this is going to think we did it.
I can never understand modern art.
I prefer my poster of Raquel Welch in "One Million B.C."
We'll get the blame for this, you know.
I told you they're evolving way faster than us.
Wait 'til you see what he's got planned for the breakfast nook.
I'm torn between eating him and having him do my portrait.
We're training him to express his rage creatively.
Should we tell Steve he's on the new menu?
We’re going to get blamed for this.
Well, Darwin, another theory shot to hell.
Dammit, Clyde, it's evolving faster than us!
Grocery list
You know, this is going to be called "fake news".......
He still thinks of himself as a Futurist.
I bet we get blamed for this.
And we never speak of this again.
He's telling the story all wrong.
I don't care how ferocious he is - I'm keeping his security deposit!
He leans to impressionism, yet he has a folksy primitive style.
This is gonna confuse a lot of people someday.
You call this getting your man cave painted?
What galls me is the cultural appropriation.
Let's hope they don't try to pin this stuff on us someday.
The decorator said he'd be done six weeks ago.
Unfortunately, they'll only be valuable after he's extinct.
You know we're going to get blamed for this...
Sometimes it's best to simply move on when seeing the writing on the wall.
Shhhh! Don't say a word. They'll be called cave paintings and we will get the credit for drawing them.
I concede your point on species appropriation. I was merely saying it is refreshing to see a perspective so unencumbered by the humanistic mores of pre-premodernism.
My reptile brain just thinks about sex.
"This will throw some future anthropologist a curve".
Look, do you want to live in a world where your whole life is posted on a wall for everyone to see?
He's one of a dying breed of artist.
Alternative facts.
He's re-writing history again
Pre-impressionism.
We finally found the elusive Picassosaurus
After he leaves, I'll sign my name.
He is really ahead of his time
Yes, it's vandalism, but I think it will one day be seen as a valid art form.
Just think what they'll be worth when he's extinct.
If we don't read the writing on the wall, we will go the way of the dinosaurs.
You have to admit, he's ahead of his time.
You say 'art', I say 'vandalism.' And dinner.
It's very derivative of what Jerry's doing down in Lascaux.
I see you have the decorapter in
He'll only answer to "Lizardo da Vinci."
At least it's not derivative.
Is it art, or just tonight's menu?
I don't get it – he won't even fetch a stick.
Just last week he was showing us what you could do by rubbing two sticks together.
He's good but not Lascaut ready
In that species it's known as erectile dysfunction.
Look, those dinosaurs are putting out more "Fake News"!
Well, alright then. Creationism it is.
We should probably nip this in the bud.
and you've been taking the credit this entire time
If dinosaurs spent more time on science and technology instead of frivolous humanities maybe they'd acquire the future-proof skills they'll need to survive beyond the Jurassic Age.
It was cheaper to outsource.
Will you STOP leaving the key under the mat!!
It's a bit "Jurassic" for my taste
It's his way of keeping track of what he is eating.
Surprisingly good for the Neanderthal period but will his work will be remembered?
That's nothin', I can trace my hand to look like a turkey.
Something's wrong with this picture.
He's signing them...like they're going to be worth something one day.
I love her contrast of prehistoric and postmodern forms
He says he expects his 'work' to last for millions of years. Ha ha.
I thought he was supposed to be extinct.
They'll be worth a lot more once he's extinct.
So thats's Banksy.
*You* tell him his art is primitive.
I'm not much for drawing. Let's go build a round thing that rolls.
No, self taught.
Doris insisted. I just wanted wallpaper.
I find his work primitive and metaphorically challenging.
And I say we wait until he finishes the master bedroom.
I think he just invented the menu.
I think he'll end up in the Museum before his drawings do.
Artist, schmartist, he looks delicious.
It has a certain extinct honesty.
Do you think he knows about the asteroid?
Paleontology, schmaleontology. He's standing the art world on it's head!
They'll appreciate him after he's extinct.
Apparently, he inspired Basquiat.
He's a visionary. Horses haven't even evolved yet.
Is his style ever going to evolve?
How long do you think we'll be doing these caption contests?
He made us look like cavemen.
I hope that's not his grocery list.
Actually he's from the New Yorker.
His art is very primitive.
Looks like a shopping list.
Sure, they're talented, but there's no future in the arts.
You're sure he's the herbivore?
He used to be ahead of his time. Now he's just another dinosaur in the art world.
To be honest, I really wouldn't be the artist I am today without my interns.
It clearly delineates his struggles with the bourgeoisie.
It does poignantly represent the fleeting nature of life, which is why he's our dinner.
It will be worth more when he's extinct.
Okay, sure he’s artistic. But in so many other ways not very evolved.
It’s okay. Future generations will think we drew them.
They'll be worth even more when he's dead.
Me bash him. You steal art.
I think it says, 'Two hunters with weapons chasing horses in moonlight smell like fish'.
I can't wait to see how this story ends.
Journalism is going the way of the dinosaurs.
I don't care whether he's the missing link. I say we call him supper.
Don’t worry, we’ll beat ‘em to the wheel.
This is exactly what the creationists want
What the comet didn't finish, the critics will.
Looks like cultural appropriation to me.
An early Montessaurus, I think.
I betcha we get blamed for this someday.
I tell you, it's better than when he tweets.
I never knew they could stand on two legs.
That'll take forever to come off!
You'll be amazed how much they're worth after he dies.
Lacks context, devoid of perspective, overly abstract, poor use of color. Who's the Neanderthal now?
He's in his Paleolithic period.
See, I told you we've been hacked.
Relax, in 50,000 years, no one will care.
Yes, he is a fine artist, but with some herb he's also a very good stew.
It's his food diary. He's into paleo.
Don't worry, the wall adds 10 pounds.
I asked him if he wanted to learn a language, but insisted he could get by with emojis.
Don't worry, he may be more talented, but he doesn't see the writing on the wall.
I bet he doesn't draw the asteroid.
Even the creationists aren't gonna believe this!
At least she didn't make you look chubby.
Interior designer!?! I TOLD you not to go with the low bid!
you know this stuff will go through the roof once he’s extinct.
Are you sure we have enough crudités for the opening?
I found him on Angie's List.
Let him finish, then we will take the credit.
His brushstrokes are like, from another era.
Dammit, I told you evolution was more than just an interesting hypothesis.
Good for him, but we'll find out if artistic ability is an adaptive survival skill.
See? I told you they can’t see colors.
Let's get out of here before he finishes updating the menu.
I preferred his Triassic period.
Anachronistic, sure. But the composition is just perfect.
That’s Picassaurus. He’s in his Triassic period
When did you hire a new decorator?
We look like total Neanderthals. Nice!
He's the last of a dying breed.
See. I told you. Standing on two legs, " "hmmmm...good idea.
It's somewhat derivative, but still impressive.
After he leaves I’ll put my mark. Never in a million years will anyone think I didn’t draw it.
Oh, great, a Banksysaurus.
You wouldn't know modern art if it bit you on the nose.
They say he created a new form of art. It's called graffiti.
She's ahead of whose time?
Oh yeah? Well, I just invented cave criticism.
I’ve heard he’s had no formal training.
Again with the figurative stuff. It's so Mesozoic.
People a million years from now are going to have a hard time explaining this.
Don't worry-- thousands of years from now we'll get the credit!
Leave him alone. Someday they will be worth a fortune.
She's keeping score.
You just can't sell a cave anymore without a stager.
What can I do? He's married to my sister.
You see? You start standing erect, pretty soon you forget all about who's got the club.
Definitely ahead of his time.
Let's kill him and say its OUR art. Who's gonna know?
We just don't have the budget to support the arts...
He paints not what he sees, but what he eats.
When I kept a food diary, you said I was wasting my time. When she does it, it’s a work of art!
There goes your theory about useless hands.
So that's what a cartoonist looks like.
What do you think: revisionist history or fake news?
I'd be more impressed if he could do it on the ceiling.
You realize we are going to get blamed for this.
Everybody thinks they're an artist.
He's from the school of Paleolithic Realism
I told you it wasn't me.
I hear it's part of his anger management therapy.
What does it matter if we take the credit? He's going to be extinct soon, anyway.
His stuff is so last era.
I never understand modern art.
Dude, I think that's Banksy
They're smarter than they look but tastier too.
Wait till he finishes so we can get the credit.
"Don't you see? It's not evolution, it's intelligent design!'
I heard he signed a five cave deal.
At least they're in a cave where no one who knows good art will ever see them.
His Paleo diet is starting to scare me.
He's no Lascaux, that's for sure.
If you dare say "His style is evolving" I'm going to brain you.
Be patient...they'll be worth more after he's extinct
Be careful. He eats art critics.
I don't think you walk him enough.
He’s showing off NOW, but he’ll be extinct by next week.
No, you tell him that realism is passé.
It's like his whole generation just keeps making pictures of his food.
You know he won't be recognized until he's extinct.
Someone is going to have a lot of fun figuring this one out.
They're too primitive for my taste.
I preferred the work from his Crustaceous period.
His landscapes are even better.
It's the take-out menu.
No worries - in another million years, we'll get the credit.
He's a regular Clawed Monet.
He has really evolved.
He took first place in the stone painting competition, so I figured what the hell.
I thought you said his arms were useless!
He's drawing up the menu.
I bet he wants an arm and a leg for it.
Well, that explains the missing charcoal
The way I see it, we'll get the credit.
If his work is good, I'm okay with getting credit for it.
The komodo has found his mojo!
I don't know about you, but I wouldn't mind a giant asteroid right about now.
They're a dying breed.
My kid could paint that.
Let him finish first. The value will skyrocket when he's dead.
I think its a menu and we are on it.
After he's finished, I sign it. It confuses the collectors.
We are about to become the world's first art critics.
Careful, looks like a shopping list for a stew recipe.
We should totally take credit for this.
Artists are a different breed.
Sucker thinks he'll get the credit for these masterpieces.
Sit back and relax. We're going to get credit for this anyway.
I told you, I'm looking for an editor, not an illustrator!
Who cares? We'll still get credit for it.
Best off all, once he's dead that wall will be worth a fortune.
I tell you, Modern Art has no future.
You know, Mom's gonna blame us.
He discovered fire, too.
It's a Banskysaurus.
He thinks he's a food critic
He call it "scorecard."
It's called Primitivism, and frankly I don't get it.
He did Urg's living room.
My wife hired him.
It's a frescosaurus.
It's her grocery list.
I mean, what do you expect? He has no thumbs ...
He's posting tomorrow's menu. We better get out of here!
I was really hoping that he was going to change the dinner menu this season . . .
We should go back and get the audio guide
I was thinking of something more traditional for that wall.
Wasting time. No wonder they’re going extinct.
It's a memoir.
The cave will be worth so much more with him dead.
Don't worry. We'll get the credit.
No, we're not waiting until he finishes; I'm hungry now.
Of course it's priceless! We have absolutely no unit of currency!
I thought YOU took away his crayons.
Dino’s CaveAdvisor recommended him for painting walls NOT wall paintings.
We'll get credited with this too someday.
It's good, but it's not "wheel" good.
Am I really that fat?
After he's dead, who's to say that I'm not the artist?
Who knew?
She's far more than just a shapely tail, Fred.
Sure his work is groundbreaking, but do you want to wake up to it every morning?
I hunt with you every day. When is the last time I carried my spear in my right hand?
His art therapy is helping with his aggressive behaviour.
I know he looks crazy but he is the same guy who invented the wheel.
'Imagine how priceless they'll be when he's extinct.'
Who cares! In three million years they'll think it was us anyway.
He's an artistsaurus
Maybe we should wait until he does your side of the cave.
And you thought cleaning up after a dog would be a big deal. It's going to take hours to scrub this crap off the walls.
First we pose for pictures, then we clobber him. OK?
He's talented,but is he edible?
i'm telling you...... an early death will make the prices go through the roof!
If it keeps him from pooping on my lawn, I'm fine with it.
Couldn’t have said it any better myself.
Are you kidding me? That's not art. It's today's menu.
The wife said he was the muralist for the the Uggums' grand entrance so of course we HAD to have him too.
Looks like we're on the menu tonight.
This is why we keep losing at Pictionary; he practices non-stop.
We are totally going to get blamed for this.
Weird thing is, we will probably get blamed for this.
Influential, sure, but such a dinosaur.
Sure, I'd submit a caption if he'd stop eating the winners
I’m guessing intelligent design not evolution.
I told you, OG, that your work was derivative.
I still think bunnies and clouds would be more appropriate for a nursery.
Perhaps you have noticed...we have expanded our menu.
We're going to be blamed for this, you know.
So now you're an art critic?
He knows too much.
This will make Betsy DeVos ecstatic.
He thinks he's so evolved.
"Learn to draw"? Nah. We just have to outlive him.
You know that we're going to get blamed for this.
Next time we get a dog.
He'll never get the credit. We will.
I don't care what you say! Graffiti is graffiti!
Just another copy cat lizard. He can call it "post-extinctionism" all he wants . . ."
Oh well, back to the wheel.
Lets call it Scientology.
My cousin Flurk at Lascaux paints more realistic wildlife.
I told you he was making fun of us.
It’s a fad. Will never last.
Yes, but is it art?
He is working on today's menu
He loves to spread fake news.
Behold! The Picassaur.
Evolution is catching up faster than I expected.
No, YOU tell him that an extinction event happened outside while he was in here getting in touch with his creative side.
See- this is what happens when we domesticate them!
Yes, its talented, but I'm hungry.
He's got ptalent.
Goddamnit—it's not art, it's vandalism!
I find his post-Jurassic period work to be a little lacking in depth.
If you walked him more, he wouldn’t get into graffiti!
He had to find something else to do. He has heel spurs.
I was going to kill him and eat him, but then I found out he did home decor.
Again, he has too many things n the menu
Once a big talent but now a dinosaur.
You call that art? My kid could do that.
It'll give us something to remember them by when they're extinct.
He is the last of his kind, no one does your full wall paintings for free anymore.
As soon as he's finished, we'll go in and sign it!
Wow, a horse that looks like a horse--he's good!
He’s got this crazy idea people will care what dinosaurs did once they’re gone.
You know, someday he's going to punish his kids for doing the same thing.
Clearly derivative.
Let him be. At least he’s drawing in this cave and not in the house where someone could see it.
I think he's on to something.
He must be writing his memoirs.
He's your roommate. You talk to him!
Let's kill him before he signs his name.
His shadowing technique is sublime and his brush work is simply remarkable. Let’s eat him.
I thought you said that Dinah Shore was painting the cave wall
I like his early work better.
He paints a picture of everything he eats, and calls it The Last Supper.
Yeah, but he's pterrible at perspective.
Rumor has it that he's from some avant-garde studio called "Intelligent Design..."
Do I really look like that ?
It's a bit primitive for my taste.
These days it's not often you see an artist who's ahead of his time
Club him before he signs it.
We've got clubs, we're hungry, and his work is derivative.
He's very creationist.
My wife hired him. She says he's trending.
Why does he bother writing it down? He serves the same things for lunch everyday.
Whose gonna tell him that the horse goes after the fish ONLY if preceded by the bird ?
I think it's a menu.
Be careful, the pen is mightier then the club.
Let's try another restaurant. I don't like being on the menu.
And my wife and I just stonewashed the walls.
It’s not a copyright infringement if he goes extinct.
He’s drawing me next week which is why I started the Paleo Diet.
His style is good technically, but it comes across as cold-blooded.
I hear that the artistic ones are tasty and more tender.
He'd do much better with an opposable thumb.
Her perspective could use some work, but she's got a real eye for color.
It's the only effective therapy from his time with the Flintstones.
Okay he can draw, but it still needs a caption!
My velociraptor could do that." "Yeah, but he didn't.
Graphittisaurus.
Let's get out of here. He looks low on red ink...
A bit too representational for my taste.
Intelligent design.
They call him Picassosaurus.
Jurassic Art
I feel safe in calling this primitive art.
Mystery solved.
You should see his quilts...
How could you forget to draw all the legs? You're so Neanderthal.
Well, he's certainly ahead of his time.
Graffiti or art -who cares, I’m starving.
It'll be forgotten soon. It's derivative and confers no evolutionary advantage.
It's a fad; it won't last. Neither will he.
Yeah, but who's going to remember his stuff a hundred years from now?
We're going to let him finish the wall and then we're going to make him pay for it.
Picassosaurus, the myth, the legend.
It's too late. That stuff will never come off.
Sorry, but I find his work rather primitive.
Remember, she is very sensitive about her work, and it an hour past her lunch”
Fake news.
Does my hair really look like that?
With our luck, I bet we go extinct and he gets all the credit.
He may be a bit unorthodox, but my wife loves what he's done with the place, and he works for bones.
He may well encapsulate our existential angst, but he's still dinner.
I don't know Larry, it feels very post-pre-historic to me.
His cubist period seems to be over.
There's really no storyline. It's just a menu.
I like it. It's avant garde without being tasteless.
Not ALL interior decorators are gay. Stop being such a cave man.
i want to make sure he doesn't make me look fat
They're nice but nobody will ever see them.
You can’t expect a dinosaur to do modern art
I suppose we’ll get the blame for this too.
See? No matter what time period you're in, modern art sucks.
Draws like a thunder lizard, tastes like chicken.
Don't worry. We'll get credit for it.
Oh - COME ON! NO depth, NO perspective, NO proportion - and you still think it's somehow providing a unique insight into our time & a creative representation of our reality?!
I can't wait for him to build us another fire.
Same strategy. You club him, and I'll sign the cave art.
YOU tell him his work is too derivative.
All she ever thinks about is food.
His Mesozoic Period work was unrivaled.
When he leaves, let’s take credit.
His work is contemporary and yet true to Upper Paleolithic influences.
They're smart alright. But unless they're smart enough to understand 'intellectual property rights,' we can take all of the credit.
When they go extinct we'll get the credit.
My mother said don't marry a dinosaur and don't marry an artist.
You can call it neo-Jurassic, I call it kitsch.
Imagine what he could do with an opposable thumb.
Once he’s done, let’s use it for a caption contest.
He's been tweeting like this ever since the election!
'That's great but let's see him make fire."
Impressive, right? He just started working in charcoal.
What do you think? Should we bust him for the graffiti or see what else he's up to?
He draw ok but captions not funny
His therapist says it reduces his stress.
The critics will eat him alive.
Darwin is gonna have a rough time with this.
I told you evolution is just a theory.
I told you evolution is just a theory.
New restaurant but same old menu every time!
If this is what happens with Airbnb, I'm not signing up again
Yeah, but it's nothing my five year old couldn't do.
If we kill him, those drawings will be worth a fortune.
It's his menu for the week!
Uh Oh! Og say: "Victor write History!
She was the only one who promised to have it done by Thanksgiving.
I guess you can teach an old dinosaur new tricks.
So much for the myth of the starving artist.
After we kill him, I'll sign it.
I found him on Angie's List.
Well, isn't this wonderful?! One day, people are gonna think WE actually drew this slop!
Are you here for the two o'clock sitting?
I can't believe she sees me as that fat.
We will probably get blamed for this graffiti.
I don't like what I see on the menu
I told him three times to keep it simple . . . something neutral in case we sell. Let's just pay him and call it a day . . .
This changes everything.....
He's writing his grocery list.
If this walking upright thing leads to modern art, I don't want anything to do with it.
So that's what opposable thumbs are for?
You hit him on the head, I'll appropriate his culture.
We know how this has to end.
I'm not against taking the cave, but I draw the line at appropriating his culture.
Relax. No one will ever see this but us.
Decorators! They promised they would be done weeks ago!
They'll be extinct soon, we'll get all the credit.
I prefer the old style of dinosaur art which left room for a bit of whimsy
Is it just me? Or, do all of his drawings make us look ten pounds heavier?
I don't think it looks much like you either, but it sure does look like your horse.
The cave wall adds 10 lbs.
He's going through his mesozoic period.
Looks like we're moving.
It's the first recorded example of what we like to call 'fakenews'.
When are these guys going to be extinct?
Be patient. He'll be extinct soon, and we'll get all the credit.
You couldn't just train him to fetch "Everyone was impressed when you taught him how to fetch, now you're just showing off.
Well, it'll be worth a lot more after he's dead.
I don't know, Zog, I'm not a big fan of his art. Too primitive.
It won’t be famous until he is extinct.
Will he be relevant in 10,000 years?
Hard to eat him after seeing his talent.
He has MOMA issues.
They call him IZOD, and he's a designer.
He's been doing it ever since he came out of that shiny disc from the sky.
I think he is trying to tell us something.
No! Let beast finish. Then we kill and take credit.
I wonder if he accepts constructive criticism...
He’s just finishing up the nursery then moving on to the parlor.
I told you it's a fixer upper. Paint over it.
His scales are way off
Artistosaurus Rex
And people say our drawings are primitive!
Dinner and a show.
I bet you we’re gonna get blamed for this.
Before we club him and eat him, can we wait to see how the story ends first?
OK, Mr. Persnickety. YOU tell him he's got it all wrong.
Look man, it’s this or he eats us.
He's ahead of his time.
He is a talent but he also won't use the litter box.
Where you see art, I see a menu.
I prefer her Pre-Cambrian period.
This guy is a real picassosaurus
He's decorating his man-cave.
Admirable, considering he possesses no opposable appendage.
Yeah, he's pretty good but he'll be extinct before he sells even one...
And they say our artwork is primitive
In a million years, they'll probably blame us for this graffiti.
I find his technique so primitive.
Whatever you do, don't say that his perspective is off.
He good cartoonist, but no have captions
Actually he’s putting up the menu for tonight’s dinner
Sure, we warned him about the asteroid. But he's just another climate-change denier.
This is why we use the DeLorean responsibly, Marty
Leave him alone. They'll think we did it.
He's good but he's no Picasso.
Too political.
Just because he can draw, that doesn't make it art.
I question if he'll evolve as an artist.
Stop encouraging him. He'll never make a decent living doing this stuff.
I hope it has a happy ending.
A bit preachy if you ask me.
Big deal. He can't fetch worth a damn.
I just don't see how he can survive as an artist.
Just so you know, all artists taste like chicken.
Let him do the painting, we'll claim it when he is extinct.
The chronology is all wrong.
Just let him keep going. Eventually, we'll get all the credit.
You know it. I know it. But does she know dinosaurs and humans never overlapped?
It's fake news.
Good luck tonight. Those bones he's writing with are all that's left of his last Pictionary partner.
You know, Blort, some day they're going to blame us for all this graffiti.
Sure, they love him now, but a hundred years from now?
He's housebroken, but we can't get him to stop drawing on the walls.
I knew this would happen if we adopted.
Perhaps we should look for a less talented dinner.
Should we kill or represent it?
Oh, great, there goes your security deposit.
This is his sixth cave. To appreciate how outre this is, George, you'll have to see Caves 1 through 5.
Commercial yes, but totally derivative.
I'd rather he get it out now than major in art later.
Talented my butt, he's preparing the dinner menu and we're an entree.
If this doesn't screw with future generations, nothing will.
After he finishes the storyboards, we'll get 50 monkeys to type the screenplay.
It's the beginning of fake news.
Oh sure, he's got a great imagination, but will it stand the test of time?
Sure it's impressive, but is it art?
Three years of art classes and that thing with no opposing thumbs is better than me.
Value go up when he extinct. Let's do it.
A little too realistic for my taste.
Sure, he's gifted, but can he survive a climate catastrophe?
Sadly, extinction may be our only remedy for the graffiti problem.
Modern art, I suppose.
Once he's out, we'll sign our names and skedaddle.
Yeah, but the style is primitive. I say he's dinner.
Plagiarus Rex
I prefer his prehistoric work
Hey, we gotta a real 'dino Vinci' here, unh?
With our luck, we’ll probably get blamed for this.
So what? My kid can draw better than that.
With his artistic talents, do you think he has a future?
If it really is Banksy, we can retire!
Once we wipe them out, we can take credit for that.
The art is nice but it will be dated in a few years.
I know what you’re thinking but she’s done wonders with the place.
I told you no pets! Now I'll never get my deposit back.
I've gotta see how this story turns out before we have lunch.
Picassosaurus Rex.
The new intern we got for data entry is working out great!
He always makes me look fat.
He’s actually a pretty good roommate—helps out on hunts. But I had to let him repaint the place.
I'm worried he's spending too much time on social media.
I'll grant you he's a good artist, but he's a better dinner.
He says it will increase the resale value.
He makes our work look primitive.
I can see his style hasn't evolved.
Primitivism is just cultural appropriation.
There goes our deposit.
Cave worth more shells if artist extinct.
They're taking all of our jobs.
She used to be big.
Everyone thinks they're an artist these days.
Yes, but I don't think this is just about art . . .
I thought history was told by the winners.
I know he discovered fire and invented the wheel but I'm really hungry!
That's a Picassosaurus.
No, I still don't believe in evolution!
It's not really my taste but my wife loves this decorator.
They're not worth much now, but after he goes extinct I'll make a fortune.
I thought we were the ones who were supposed to be evolving.
Let's kill him. Extinct, his work is worth a fortune.
It'll be worth a lot more if he's dead.
My wife got tired of the old wallpaper.
Sure he's talented and extremely rare but I am hungry NOW!
You can call it art...I say it's a damn menu!
He always writes out his lunch menu in advance.
You knock him out; I'll sign it.
I thought we agreed on wall paper.
Whatever you do the rest of your life, DON"T TELL THE CREATIONISTS!
It's OK, in a million years everyone will think we drew them.
Let's not and say we did.
Typical revisionist history.
You have to admire how he simultaneously deconstructs and glorifies his subjects, however his overuse of charcoal is problematic
I forget. Are we the pets or is he the pet?
Don’t club him yet...I want to see how this ends!
We’ve been hacked.
It'll never stand the test of time.
He's willing to work in more than one medium if we move to a bigger cave.
Revisionist history
His work has really improved since he cut his ear off.
He good, but he no Banksy.
I hope that's not his menu....
And they say we're the missing link!
Impressive. But they still taste like chicken.
Wait'll you see what he's done with his place.
You know, I just don't get prehistoric art.
THAT IS HIS DINNER MENU
After he stopped walking on all fours he really found himself.
A Michelangeloasauras.
Yes, his enthusiasm is good but his use of perspective is crap.
In the future, they'll discover these paintings and he'll be famous.
He calls it, Afternoon in Jurassic Park with Rex.
He keeps going on about a big rock falling from the sky.
Don't worry, the wall always adds ten pounds.
He claims he has a brain with two sides.
I'm worried about future generations - they'll think we're primitive.
Don't club yet, Grok. Me want to see how story ends.
Let's sign our name when he's done
No, he's a reptile. Amphibians can't draw.
You can really see the Jurassic influence in his work.
My apologies, Bob. It appears your theory of devolution isn’t so farfetched after all.
If we became bipeds, we could paint too.
That barely looks like us, he'll never make it.
Sure, he's avant-garde now, but one day he'll be a fossil.
They're actually quite evolved.
Where did he get the charcoal?
I hate being on the menu.
I saved a starving artist. Now I have to feed him.
I think we're on the menu.
I got a new Designosaur.
What a talented artist. He makes your work look prehistoric!
Great. Now we're stuck out here until he runs out of wall.
You'd think he never heard of wallpaper.
See? I told you that even my lizard could do that.
He's got no sense of scale.
They'll be worth a fortune after he's extinct.
It's gonna make us look a lot better in 30,000 years.
Please tell me I am not that hairy?
I find his work primitive yet strongly appropriate to both subject and medium.
If he can draw, then we can talk.
Fake news.
Don’t worry. History is told by winners
His work is so derivative.
Let's Invent Spray Paint Instead of Fire.
Who's NINA ?
They'll think we were nine feet tall, or that the floor dropped
Great, now in 50,000 years we're gonna be blamed for this crap.
It was bad enough when she started walking on her hind legs.
I didn't know he could stand on two legs!
The sociocultural aspect is a little obvious, isn't it?
The composition is a little primitive.
I agree, the wall adds 10 pounds.
Do you still think his brain is the size of a walnut?"
That is SO not how the event transpired.
No need to fret. In a few thousand years, everybody will assume *we* did it.
... and not a word to my wife!! She loves his work, has five of his paintings.
we have to wipe them all out or we're just going to look stupid.
And yet he still pisses on the floor...
Decent enough technique, but not overly original.
We'd better get out of here before someone thinks we did this.
We can't kill him, this story is just getting good."
In cave painting nobody knows you're a palaeopteryx
I hear he's the best interior designer in town
'No way! They'll just say it's fake news'
I told you I wanted wallpaper!
His art is derivative and shallow, but all the critics get eaten.
He said he'll show us 'fire' next week.
You know, 40,000 years from now we're going to be blamed for this.
Our broker hired him to stage the cave.
Now that there's fire and charcoal everybody's got a story to write.
What do you mean we should just leave it there? Eons from now they'll think we lived like animals.
But who's ever going to believe his arms could reach that high?
Now you can see why the critics are all so positive.
Of course his art work is worth a fortune, he's been extinct for millions of years.
Those stupid drawings of his will never come off.
Summa cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa, a $200,000 Ivy League education, and the only job he can land is cave decorator!
It's gonna take forever to scrub that off!
Look who thinks he's an artist!
OK you tell him it's not his cave
You're sure he said having us 'over' for dinner?
He said it is a menu! What's a menu?
You tell him he's an anachronism
Let it go ahead and draw. After its gone extinct the cave will be worth a fortune.
It will be more valuable after he dies.
Very primitive - she must have been raised by Neanderthals.
It lacks the gravitas of his earlier work.
My daughter can do that.
My kid could paint that.
I can't believe no one told us about the new emojis.
I never suspected it was them.
If we kill him now, those drawings will be worth a fortune someday.
There was a mixup at the agency - we asked for a wall re-tile, but they sent us a wall reptile instead.
We'll let him finish, kill him, and then take all the credit
No, no. Let's not wipe them out yet... I want to see how they make fire.
Ugh, is my butt really that big?
Yes, I know he's a troglodyte, but his painting style is cutting edge.
Now it's your turn to clean up the graffiti!
When you said Liz was doing the wall decoration I though she was a woman.
We’ll get credit for these eventually, just give it some time.
"The iconicity of the metaphorical perturbation resonates with the disjunctive eloquence.'
I like new perspectives in art, but I find his work rather cold-blooded.
When he goes extinct, we'll claim the credit.
I agree with you, Thad, but at least he's out of that godawful neo-cubism phase.
That's nothing, I hear they've got a Brontosaurus up north who likes to stack really big rocks.
It’s among the finest examples of primitive expressionism I’ve ever seen.
Shh... That's Tyron Rex. He did Stonehenge!
And he does it all without opposable thumbs!
What's the hieroglyph for plagiarism?
They're charming in a primitive sort of way, but I've always preferred his early Cretaceous Period for its authenticity.
Let him be. In the future everybody will assume we are the artists.
Just think of what this will do for home prices around here.
Not art. Menu!
Hm... I never did like pre-modernism.
That will definitely confuse anthropologists!
I can't see a future in it either...
It has a sort of primitive charm.
He’s my ghost writer
You just don't see artists like that anymore.
We are all just notches on the wall.
Whaddaya wanna bet we get blamed for that?
He goes by Picassosaurus.
He's pretty good. Let's stay at your place and let him finish.
Let him finish. The value will skyrocket once they're extinct.
That is Lizardo de Vinci.
My feeling? Too abstract. We club.
Looks like we're on the menu.
So he's got talent but will he have staying power.
Did you hear he got a full ride to RISD?
Superficially it's about the hunt. But all paintings are in their essence, self-portraits.
How does it feel to have a pet that's smarter than you?
He claims to be a herbivore, but look at that list of groceries.
I didn't know they could stand upright.
I hit him with club. You co-opt his aesthetic.
He says there'll be a caption contest someday.
Do you want to tell him he could save 15% or more by switching to Geico, or should I?
Cave art or graffiti?! Look man, it's a reptile, standing on two legs and painting--in color!
You realize he's got a pea-sized brain and he's touching up our cave drawings!
I don't know about you, but I've never been a big fan of Primitive Art.
It's easy. Club him and we'll get the credit
Let's tell everybody we drew them
I have no idea what it's doing but we have bigger sticks - let's kill it.
Tell me about it . . .same design on the wallpaper at Granite Home Decorating for a tenth of the price.
His method has been dead for 65 million years.
He's changed completely since he went on Prozoic.
You look better with short hair.
I told you he wasn't a herbivore
You can't have your art and eat it too.
Paleolithographs.
I'm not that fat am I?
You call that "art"? My three year old could do that....
Did he make me look fat?
Looks like we're back on the menu.
I’ve got a five year old nephew who could do that!
This is gonna fool the hell out of someone later on.
Let him go. Someday we'll get credit for it.
Art isn't just dying. It's going extinct.
It's the elusive Picassosaurus
If he draws one more fake news horse, I'll club him!
My five-year old could do that.
They'll be known as his Paleolithic period works, you knuckle dragger.
I hope the clubs work better than the spears did.
I knew it was a mistake to ask you to pick out the wallpaper .
...but exactly how much is this decorator going to cost me?
I prefer impressionists- let's eat him.
Don't worry, I bought her washable markers to draw with.
My cave drawings paleo in comparison.
I think he's gifted...don't you, honey?
He thinks because he can stand up, he can do anything.
Now remember; club first, critique second.
It's how they count calories.
As soon as he finishes the apartment, we'll eat him.
Lascaux find another cave
It's a Banskysaurus.
The last time someone critiqued him they lost a leg.
Looks like we're gonna discover plagiarism.
Don't be critical. He'll evolve.
If we do this we can change history
We're totally stealing this and putting it on our Facebook Wall.
I can't wait for these graffiti artists to go extinct.
Can it really be considered "post-modern?"
With him out of the way, we could take the credit.
He's the last one. I say we eat him!
He recently completed his Jurassic period and is now embracing Realism.
I thought we weren't keeping score.
You tell him no graffiti.
He's reptilian, but he paints like a primate.
I just can't separate the artist from the predator
Can you believe that little reptile has been short-listed for the Booker Prize?!
If I'm being honest, I much preferred his earlier work.
They say he's ahead of his time.
Fake news again!
He's doing it again, the meaningless drawing thing.
Looks like plagiarism to me.
I finally got him to stop with those happy little clouds.
Everybody’s a critic.
He'd be more successful if he didn't eat his patrons.
Do we exit through the gift shop?
Representational art always seems so obvious.
Special?....my two year old could do that.
He's drawn to prey.
The elders want limits on self-expression. And we need meat.
Just more fake news.
It cost me an arm and a leg but a picassosaurus is worth it.
Not only does he do nice work...we got him for 2 pterodactyls.
Big deal, let's see him grow a beard.
As long as we clobber him, BEFORE he signs it, we can take all the credit for it.
There is no religious significance. I said "prey," not "pray"!
It’s a limited series...The gallery is calling it “Pre-Extinction Art”
I think his images are very derivative.
I was going to go with wall paper, but this really makes the place one-of-a-kind.
I say we kill him, and up the value of his art.
I say it perpetuates an unrealistic body image for young cavepeople.
Let's kill it and take credit for the origin of symbolic behavior.
I just thought of a new word... "plagiarism".
When he becomes extinct we’ll take credit.
Chiaroscuro good. Perspective bad. Ugg.
This kind of thing is really messing with my ideas on evolution.
He said something about a cartoon caption contest.
Another primitive artist? What is it about you and primitive art, anyway?
I like his work, but it's a little primitive.
Yes, they're good likenesses, but is it art?
So that's what Banksy looks like!
Be careful - the Crayolasaurus is filled with angst and despair.
It's not better than our wheel invention...what's the point of a grocery list if you can't take it to the store?
Does he realize he'll have to repaint when he moves out?
I've got a good sense of perspective too, Gak, and we need to kill him.
I thought you told you wife no more interior decorators!
At least you can't say his work is derivative.
History is written by the winners. Get over it.
If we kill him, we can take the credit for the art,
Sure, he's a real and present danger, but evolving to become president--I just don't see it.
In a few thousand years, they'll think that we were great artists!
Just think how much they will worth when they are extinct!
Early dinosaur art is so exciting. Primitive, however.
So how do you like your new printer?
Hold up, I want to see how the story ends!!
History is written by the victor.
Plagiosaurus is harmless but annoying.
But it's not true primitivism.
Yes...I commissioned him. Artforum said he's gonna be huge in a couple of years...
Those garish colors... that Pop-Art sensibility... it's like he's not even trying.
His evolution has been fascinating.
Don’t worry. To the evictors go the spoils.
We’re witnessing history.
He can't stop posting photos to his wall...
I hear he cut off one of his own dorsal plates.
We're gonna have to get off our knuckles and evolve, Krog.
Yes, it's sad, but think what they'll be worth after we eat him.
I count three NINAs.
You said, you drew those.
I clearly said "Cavort." But she heard "Cave Art."
All that without opposable thumbs.
He got my hair all wrong.
Wow...your Home Entertainment System is a real dinosaur.
So much for intelligent design.
I'm more into abstract expressionism myself
Yeah, but is it still art when they do it?
He's too Jurassic period for my taste.
Tonight's specials for his restaurant.
Looks like an obituary column to me.
Stupid Pet Tricks
You could've taught him to roll over or shake, but you thought draw was the trick to start with?
He’s preparing to tell the story of how men evolved into dinosaurs.
My two year-old could do that.
I thought you said your artwork was original.
The vet suggested we encourage him express his creativity to help with the fire breathing.
Revisionist history
It's a menu.
I thought you sold me an original.
In 10,000 years scientists won't know what they mean. Besides, they'll think we did them.
He did my neighbor's cave, got paid a fortune.
Let 'im finish... we'll take the credit later...
What should we tell him first: that painting is dead, or that dinosaurs are extinct?
I hope we don't get blamed for that primitive work.
When they're anatomically correct, then I'll be impressed.
Don’t worry, it’s not like he can sign it.
Don't worry, history will credit us.
It really thinks someone is going to be interested in looking at it someday.
You tell him to clean it.
He’s at an awkward stage and I’m worried about his future --- he spends most of his time alone in his room posting things on that stupid wall.
We'll get blamed for this.
Maybe we should come back when he's not so busy.
He's on your side of the cave.
Why, oh why does an artist facing looming extinction go with chalk?
The species won't last because it'll never find a job.
You club him, I’ll figure out the caption.
He says he is a Dalisaur.
Well, there's no problem with provenance.
Sure he has style. But where’s the substance?
Imagine the resale value when she's extinct!
Let's sign it - they'll never believe he drew it!
He paints his passion: devouring his subject matter.
I don't know why she's famous. * I *could do *that*.
Do you think he made me look fat?
Disappointedly, two dimensional
Okay, urk, I’ll bash him and you sign it.
I say we hit him on head and take credit.
Do you think he's making fun of us?
He's just showing off, overcompensating for his tiny hands.
Oh, great. Now we'll never get back our cleaning deposit.
Don't worry, Marvin...when the trains start coming through no one is going to give shit what's on the wall.
Don't worry, Skorg--I caught his most recent show in Chelsea the other day. His days as top predator are numbered.
We’re still paying his student loans for art school
Let's go ....No one is going to believe a dragon did it.
Let's see if those fancy little sticks are going to help him now.
At last we know where all that fake news is coming from!
That's nothing—mine has entered its cubist phase.
Wait until he's done. Paintings' value increases when the artist dies.
Can you image what he could do if he had the 64 box with built in sharpener.
Early Graffiti . . Hope no one thinks we did this.
If we kill him not only will we have food, but the value of our cave art will increase immeasurably.
Sorry, wrong cave. She's the artist in residence.
Should we club him anyway?
Shh... be quiet. He almost saurus.
His work is clealy derivitive of the upper cretaceous neo-reptilian school.
And I thought he was a vegetarian.
These are originals. We're golden!
I think he's captured our ennui.
I knew those little arms would be good for something.
It's the menu for his new restaurant
He does the work and we get the credit.
His prices have skyrocketed ever since we found his tracks and poop.
...and the price will skyrocket once he’s extinct.
His work is so contrived. What a dinosaur.
Big deal, my kid could do that.
The exuberance of color rendering is reminiscent of the late Paleolithic.
He's good, but I bet he won't be appreciated in his own time.
It's the same as the lunch menu, but with higher prices.
I thought you said all the best decorators were gay.
Well, it's OK, but I think it's primitive.
Why did he make us so small?
Yes, but his grasp of perspective is sadly lacking!
Imagine how much it will be worth when he's extinct.
I agree that he's an artistic visionary, but we're also starving.
My wife hired him to decorate. I try to stay out of it.
He won't respond to calls, but he's always posting on his wall.
And all without opposable thumbs.
So that's how they got there.
He's a dinosaur. Does it still count as cultural appropriation if we take credit?
I dunno...seems somewhat derivative to me.
I don't know about you, but I've had it with primitivism.
I have a bad feeling about today's menu.
I bet they'll be worth something when he's extinct.
Don't worry about him. He's doomed for extinction.
Personally, I found the work quite primitive
It's the hottest new restaurant in town. The menu changes every week. It's all Paleo and Gluten-Free.
He has a brain the size of a walnut, but he sells better than me.
I think he’s trying to alter history.
Look! It's a BobRossosaurus.
For the last time - let him finish, we take the credit.
They call him Dalisaurus.
Can you just go talk to her for me?
It’s a break from Primitivism, more like Post-Neolithic Expressionism.
He's been drawing a lot since the election.
Is that his dinner menu?
Pretty good, right? I'm thinking of using him to illustrate my "Paleo Diet" book.
Well, this clearly challenges our understanding of history!
I prefer his earlier Jurassic work.
We're still eating him.
Don't club the messenger.
We better get drawing or they’ll never know we were here.
Believe me, it'll be worth a lot more after he's dead.
Yeah, that's the one that ate Leonardo.
Are you sure you want to eat here? It looks like we're the house specialty.
It's the kids menu.
How are those cartoons funny?
There may be some lingering resentment.
Shhh, he's my ghostwriter.
Not bad. Think we could get him over to Lascaux?
Do you still believe in evolution?
There's no way I'm that fat - I've been on a strict paleo diet my whole life.
What are you worried about? There's only got room for 140 characters.
The cave adds ten pounds.
I don't understand post-paleo art.
I could have totally drawn that if I thought of it.
If this gets out, my reputation and legacy will be ruined!
I guess this means we have to rethink that theory of evolution.
Representational and unevolved.
We'll take the credit and then stage the body to look like he died 100 million years ago.
You think this is good? You should see his watercolors!
Notice how tiny his hands are.
I don't care how creative it is, I need dinner !
I think they'll be worth more if he's not around.
I think we can learn something from this.
These starving artists are all a dying breed!
They say the family just moved here from Lescaux
He's doing freelance work during these difficult financial times.
Primitivism just doesn’t speak to me.
Are we supposed to feed him, pay him or club him?
She demanded complete creative control.
He's clever, but none of his stuff will last.
Yeah, it's safe. That's just our artist-in-residence.
I told you dinosaurs are sketchy.
I heard he eats everything he draws.
They're going to be extinct. We'll get all the credit.
I wish I would have thought of that!
Well, if they do go extinct, they'll at least stop marking up our walls!
Judging by his artistic ability he'll be extinct within the millennia.
His landlord is so not going to give him his deposit back on this place!
I'm having second thoughts -- those guys had spears.
To hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature.
NO more interns, OK?
Show off!
Let's wait until he evolves into a chicken.
Art historians won't have a clue who did this.".
I'm not going to be the one that tells him his painting is derivative.
It's dinner and a show.
I predict we’re going to be blamed for these.
You know those stains will never come out.
I wonder how his story ends.
If we don't club him, we'll never evolve.
You clobber him and I'll cook him and we'll just tell everybody it was a meteor.
He misspelled pterodactyl.
This steakhouse features locally-sourced ingredients.
His therapist said it would be good for his anger.
He's in his post-primordial period.
Trust me, the drawing added ten pounds .
Art is more valuable after the artist's death.
I think that's the new art teacher
Oh man, that's never gonna come off.
It's too photo-realistic for my taste.
He calls it artistic license. I say it's revisionist history.
I don't know when his arms got long enough to reach the walls, but he's going to have to go..
Let him finish and then we'll sign our names at the bottom
At least junior is being creative during his time out.
I believe it is an erectus illustratus!
My wife got tired of the old decorations.
Humph! Gork worked in that medium an age ago.
Before you know it, they'll be selling insurance.
It's a risk, yes, but she's just as skillful as the males and I thought I'd give her a chance.
What's a plagiarist? And why would I want to eat one?
I know, but the kids love 'em.
One of the last ones, let him finish first...
This new gallery is going to price us out of the neighborhood.
I can't believe she left you for an artist.
It looks like post modernism to me.
And I'm gonna assume that whole fire thing was your idea, too?
Ten thousand years from now, who's gonna care?
Do we bust him for graffiti or get him to teach us how he does it?
The next thing you know, they will be saying we did it.
We can do better
Does this fossil really have to post after every hunt?
Nobody clubs anyone until he has a chance to decorate the baby's room.
OK so he's talented - how's he going to earn a living?
We really need to up our act.
When does he think he is, 1508 AD?
All he ever posts is cute pictures of prey.
A million years from now people are going to think we did that.
Damnit Carl, I told you the alarm company sticker in the window wasn’t enough of a detterent.
They’ll be worth even more when he’s extinct.
My wife hired him--says the new decor adds class to my man cave!
Looks like the lunch menu.
You in for some cultural appropriation?
Don't kill him yet-in the future people will think we drew them
I don't know art but I know what I like.
I just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance.
They say the cave adds ten pounds.
I've always said he was ahead of his time.
I told you George, evolution is not a straight line.
I don't know what it is—but I feel strongly we should club it before it signs its name.
Walk slowly and let him know he can sell prints on Etsy.
Whaddya mean we have to respect modern art? I'm hungry!
There's no future in that.
I told you he wasn't a herbivore
They're going to think it was us.
If we don't stop him, we caveman are going to be blamed for these primitive, poor quality drawings.
You know, if he dosen't sign his mane, they'll think we did it.
I told you--it's all fake news.
He's been into the Arts ever since seeing the royalities from my Geico commercial.
This goes beyond simple cultural appropriation.
Bet they charge an arm and a leg for a portrait.
Yeah, but my wife likes art more than a dinosaur steak.
Darwin will love this
He should be thinking about survival, not art.
Who the hell wants to look at pictures of his dinner?
My cave kid could cave paint that.
Me just think of new concept called "appropriation."
Now don't you go drawing conclusions.
Hold on, Flint, I think its Banksy.
Derivative, but well executed.
Let him finish, I'm telling you, this'll be worth millions after he's dead!
'Lizardardo da Vinci'
My wife hired a decorator
Not exactly my taste, but I guess I can live with it.
And he won’t get a real job.
It's better than his neolithic work.
His technique is O.K., but his style is so Pleistocene
I hope they don't think we did this.
He wants to be remembered as an artist
There's a resemblance, but I don't believe it's you.
It's when he switched to oils that it really became annoying.
I knew you didn't draw them.
What difference will it make in 100,000 years!
Oh oh, that's bad news, we need to tell the others; he has just expanded his menu items to include humans.
I hear we show up in the sequel.
I hired him to design the new menu.
If I didn't see it with my on eyes ,I'd never believe they could stand.
The Joneses' one can only do stick figures.
If I were you I wouldn't criticize her style.
What are we going to tell Darwin?
It takes more than talent to make it in this world.
We've been using art therapy to help him work through his extinction.
The vernissage is this evening at six
I think I know where Fred and Wilma have been.
Watch one home improvement show and everyone thinks their an expert.
You know, Ugg, they say squid are intelligent, too. Doesn't mean I'm giving up calamari.
His mom and I wish he would play outside for a change.
I think he is posting on his wall.
Well, that solves the question of whether dinosaurs existed when cavemen did.
I find his rendering of us intentionally offensive.
I have no taste for art but the artist will taste good.
At least he's not doing the interpretative dance anymore.
I'd buy one right off the wall, but the gallery owner is a lousy chiseler.
Do you think future inhabitants of the earth will still be writing on each other’s walls?
Let it be. Someday we’ll get the credit as great cave artists.
Antelope for dinner, again?
Or we could just let nature take its course.
Let history be the judge here.
I think it's the rare " sketch-a-saurus!
He's known as, "The Creationist."
This also explain's Krug's body being found with utensils.
I told you no one would be at this gallery opening
Be careful - I heard he eats critics for lunch.
I'd be more interested in eating here if were weren't on the menu.
We better put our side of the story in stone too.
If he gives me small hands again...
He is really rewriting prehistory.
Early plagiarism.
Worst thing, he expects us to stand in raptor admiration.
I found him on Rex's List.....
I thought you were teaching him to fetch?
The origin of fake news
If you think you can do any better go ahead and knock him out.
People 20 thousand years from now are NOT going to believe this.
After we whack him it's my turn to put in the captions.
I hope this doesn't reflect poorly on us in 35,000 years.
History is written by the lizards
This guy's art is historic.
No kill yet. Let finish master bedroom first.
I thought we were going with a more modern decor?
They call it art, but it's really just a precursor to gentrification.
Is it appropriation if they're technically extinct?
I hope that's not his grocery list.
I think it's a Degasaurus
YOU tell him to clean off the wall!
I'm not certain which way our evolution is heading, but this doesn't bode well.
You had to give him charcoals.
I sell his work for millions, and all he asks is three lizards a day.
Are those the lunch specials?
He says it'll appreciate in a few thousand years.
"He's one of the best Man Cave artists around".
Let's see how Darwin explains this!
So many people are afraid of contemporary art these days.
After we eat him, let’s leave a few handprints on the wall.
Yeah, but he can't hunt worth a damn!
Gronk kill more than 2 yaks, 1 antelope and 1 bird... Fake News!
Yeah, but if we start copying him, what does that say about evolution?
The first grocery list
We always lose, the way he draws it.
Let him finish... then we eat.
Well, apparently, he goes by the name of 'Banksy.'
It’s call modern art for a reason, Dan.
Cave Hunters Show say custom artwork hurts resale value.
It’s reminiscenr of his Paleozoic period.
No, we let him finish first, then we take the credit!
And he calls OUR work fake news.
When will Lascaux get with the times and pass a graffiti ordinance?
Let's go see if the Mammoth finished with the pottery.
Interesting use of ochre but the composition needs work.
They're not to scale
It's so hard to find an affordable decorator today. The breed is practically extinct!
See... I told you those art lessons would pay off.
I said 'new carpets' not 'new cavepets'!
A Jurassic cave drawing in a Triassic rambler--what an idiot!
No, I can’t do that either, but his technique is so ... primitive.
His style is definitely late Jurassic.
It's a trap. Don't believe he just wants you to see his etchings.
He does have an eye for realism.
He calls it 'fake news.'
Fake glyph.
Face it. He is never going to be happy going hunting with Dad.
Watch me teach this graffiti artist a lesson he soon won't forget.
Let him finish , then will kill him and sign his work
How the hell did HE get accepted at Parsons?
I say we club him and they'll think we painted it.
What do you expect? It's already discovered fire.
We should let him live just to piss off Richard Dawkins.
Is it an homage or a menu?
He's the Dinoangelo of our time."
He calls it "food porn"...whatever that is.
Why are we always ugly?
Fucking lizards. I hate them.
I had always wondered what those tiny arms were for.
Thus far, the talented ones have escaped extinction.
You really might be onto something with these unpaid internships.
Apparently, it's called "Art Therapy".
Maybe we should start standing on our hind legs too
His next project is a pyramid.
I encourage him to explore his inner creature.
He get's $2 for a caricature. Let's do it!
Our home is being defaced by our dinner.
Sheesh, editors.
Frankly, I'd prefer wallpaper.
He really has evolved into a great artist.
Right after he finishes the fight scene, we’ll eat him.
The interior decorator thought a primitive art theme would work best.
I hate editors.
Once they're extinct, it will be worth a fortune.
Please tell me you got a damage deposit.
He's wasting his time. I just saw Noah building his boat.
Ahead of his time!
I think it's safe to go in... he's obviously already eaten Leonardo.
I told you to lock the cave!
I get the extinct feeling he is mocking us
I just don't dig primitive art
The menu never evolves. Same old same old. A couple of meats. A fish. A fowl.
I think we’re witnessing the dawn of science fiction.
revolutionary?...no evolutionary?...only time will tell
Re-writing history to suit his own views, so wrong!
Martha hired some fancy foreigner to decorate.
Again? He wants more colors?
My stick is much larger than that!
You know you're never going to get that crayon off that wallpaper.
He's no cutting-edge artist. His latest exhibition is like something out of the Stone Age.
Fake news or is he just bragging?
Just let it be. It’s his Last Will.
I think I look fat.
Let him finish, then we'll take credit and trade it for a bigger cave!
If it is Banky, in 20,000 years it'll be worth lots of shiny things.
It's a Sketchasaurus.
We're losing control of the narrative.
If he gets the grant, I'm switching to watercolor.
The menu never changes
It's the interior decorator my wife hired.
Oh, please. No one is going to believe he did it.
They say his works have an animalistic, almost prehistoric, vibe.... Frankly, I find those comments offensive...
See what happens when you start outsourcing?
He's union.
BANKSYSAURUS
Her work is daringly post-Cretaceous.
Are you going to eat him when he's done?
Dumb beast hasn't mastered perspective.
He's got real talent. It's a shame that we have to club him to death.
You're the one that wanted to adopt.
That's all he does since you got him those sticks!
I think the brushstrokes would be more powerful if his arms were longer.
I don't mind. He does the work. We get the credit.
Again we get to the opening before it's ready. That's why everyone calls us "Early Man".
I must admit, it does make the place look nicer. We should do that in our cave.
I don't care how much you like it, it's still outsider art.
He made me look fat.
I heard he’s already working on the prequel
Richard Dawkins won't be happy with this.
Everything he draws is so lifelike
A million years from now, we'll get the credit.
Nobody's invented intellectual property rights yet, so let's club him and take the credit.
Of course it's primitive realism. He's a dinosaur with an MFA
You may see artistic theft, murder and extinction, but I see the logo for my New Age cafe.
If he doesn't straighten up and get a real job, I swear he's going extinct.
He's crazy-- nobody will believe that story!
I have a feeling we'll get blamed.
you said his brain was how small?
He goes by 'Dinotello'.
Think she's making a grocery list?
They never get my nose right.
We are going to have to stop him, otherwise, in a few thousand years, they will think we were terrible drawers.
Don't worry in 45,000 years from now they'll think we did the drawings.
He's become the voice of our generation.
Don't worry. Cavemen and dinosaurs only co-exist in cartoons.
These dinosaurs just keep coming in and taking our jobs!
We're going to get blamed for this, just know it.
Leave him alone... he's making us look good.
It's cheaper than wallpaper.
What's particularly remarkable is he lacks opposing thumbs.
I wouldn't pose for him. He likes having his models over for dinner!
He's booked through winter
This is your lizard brain on drugs.
First kill, then appropriate art. Works for us in future.
Lizards have opposable thumbs?
We'll do it just before he signs, and we'll take credit.
More fake wall news !
I’ve never been a fan of abstract extinctionism.
I need to get something off my chest. All this time I thought it was you who was sneaking in here and drawing penises on my artwork.
Who in Nog's name is Banksy?
With drawings like that, he'll be extinct in no time.
Call me paleolithic but since when did cave graffitti become "art?"
I think it's a menu.
He calls it Post-Meteorite.
Don't believe any of that nonsense. It's all fake news.
2000 years from now, we will get blamed for this
Why are we always behind the times?
You won't want to model for him - he's a realist.
It's called Abstract Jurassic.
He prefers ordering off the menu.
There's got to be a way we can take credit for this.
Hey, I know him, that's Art!
In selling real estate, staging is crucial.
Ugh! He’s so-o-o Neo-Lithic.
Let's do violence upon him and then appropriate his cultural heritage!
He did a beautiful mural in my daughter's room before he ate her.
I say we make him an Extinctionist painter.
The wife insisted we get an interior designer.
Omnivore Galore
Who said history is written by the victors?
He said he's sick and tired of not controlling his own narrative.
It’s Banksy!
I like his abstract work better.
Looks like his lunch menu for next week. We'd better pack up and bolt.
Home schooled.
Years from now you know they’re going to blame all this fake news on us.
Og, I really think he captured your likeness. Me -- not so much.
OMG, if Izod puts one more posting on his wall, I'mma goin' club him!
I find the primitive realism to be obscenely exaggerated.
Actually, they are doing murals in all of the new caves.
We better nip this in the bud.
He's in a "Post-Jurassic" phase
Excuse me, is this Intro to Painting?
I don’t care if he does have unlimited texting. Enough’s enough!
I don't know, I think I preferred his blue period.
I warned you about renting to dinosaurs.
I hired him to get rid of the bats.
This art therapy fling is ruining our man-cave aesthetic.
Is he painting his last supper?
It is not done well; but you are surprised to find it done at all.
I find the overall composition curiously amateurish, especially given the utter perfection he conveys through such exquisitely captivating detail.
I am sick of his Cave Drawing Caption contests. Let’s get him.
It's humiliating until you realize he's terrible at hands and feet.
First the lizartists move in, then the rents go up.
Did you hire him?
We have no choice. She contradicts evolutionary theory.
Reptiles drawing pictographs! What a bunch of croc.
Does that bloody Gahanasaurus have to post a picture of every meal he's had?
The art of a meal.
I trust they will know fake news when they see it.
He draws a picture of everything he eats!
This new intern program is great. They do the work, and we get the credit.
And you let me think it was you!
His artwork has really evolved.
I had a feeling it wasn't you.
I believe he's drawing favorite edibles.
I guess this means we're buying that sofa.
You first! I've got bone spurs. Sad!
Evolutionary Art, they say.
The wanton defacement of private property makes killing him all the easier.
He's erasing our monuments and changing our history!
Grok not make. FAKE NEWS!
(obscure and therefore not a winner but funny if you look it up): "Hey, isn't that Werner Herzog in an Albino Crocodile Costume?"
He'll probably be big after he goes extinct.
I named him Rexbrandt.
That’s not abstract! It’s surreal!
I've had enough of this guy sharing pictures of his food.
And he called our work primitive...
Are you sure about this evolution thing?
Don’t worry, this graffiti fad will blow over soon enough.
He calls it primitive art.
Wasting his time again with pictures that will be forgotten by tomorrow.
He’s making our cave great again.
Obvious _and_ derivative.
You know his work might start selling if we kill him.
His style's a little too primitive for my taste.
Oh, I came up with a caption right away - the problem is, it's too obvious.
That's the one that stole my pen.
Just a minute boys, I'm writing my editorial.
Ever get that feeling you're a bit too early?
Let's just see how things evolve...
I told you that sending him to art school was a big mistake.
Proto-Cubism.
Who asked him to turn our den into a drawing room?
Gloog, I just don't get this "modern" art . . . but in the context of human evolution, maybe I'm overthinking it.
Representational art is so last year.
They're all artists... they won't be able to survive very long here.
Nobody has to know who made the drawings, if we just take over.
Whack him and we're famous!
His drawings of Adam and Eve are amazing, it's like he was there himself.
It's the first time I've seen fake news.
Make sure to look at the daily specials. Some days aren’t as good as others.
If we play it right, we can get credit for this a million years from now. Residual rights for our descendants will put them in a cozy cave.
The brushwork is so exquisite I kind of feel bad about eating all of her eggs.
Damn revisionist!
He’s not cheap but the nursery should be done in no time!
Frankly, I find it rather derivative.
These old guys are going to take credit for everything.
That's Eric - his dad owns the mountain.
When I said we need an interior decorator this is not what I had in mind.
Anyway, it's his word against ours...
The fellas told me that Rex's modern artwork becomes priceless when he's extinct!
I told you this was a transitional neighborhood!
Let's kill 'em and take the credit.
He’s got the fame now, but in 12,000 years we’ll be the stars
His earlier work is much more primitive.
Yeah... but he won't be starving for long if you don't keep your voice down
He's oversharing again.
Once he's extinct we can pass this is off as ours!
He's expensive, but the bump in resale value will make up for it.
And you thought street art was extinct!
Once they're extinct, we'll take the credit.
So much for your extinction theory
When the cavemen are away, the dinos will play.
So what do you think about your precious diversity now, Zog?
I dunno. I've always been more of a fan of his Post-Pleistocene work
Ha ha. He has to draw the same picture twice because his brain is too small to handle Arabic numerals.
I didn't see that coming
That's his week of lunches.
Well, you know what they say: 'One man's Mesozoic reptile is another man's Paleolithic dinner.'
You and I are on that wall; he's so cold-blooded.
We wanted him to go to medical school, but he has other ideas.
Hmm...do we eat him, or hire him?
Pretty sophisticated for a lizard, don't you think?
History is written by the victor.
With such tiny hands, it's a wonder he can do anything at all.
Great. Millions of years from now, he'll get all the credit.
There's the lowlife doing all that graffiti
I don't have time to draw anymore now that I'm writing.
To be honest, I don't really understand modern art.
You and your two footed friends
Yes... a great artistic touch plus an eye for fashion, intellect, charm and wit... but what really attracted me are her opposing thumbs...
don't disturb him, we can take all the credit
I'm tellin'ya man, we need to evolve faster.
I knew he would snarf us down in an instant but I never knew he had a sensitive side.
Dinosaur? I see an innovator.
How the hell did he get my crayons?
So if we eat it AND move in it's cultural appropriation?
No way we can eat him now, am I right?
Me think art not as outrageous as New Yorker thinking dinosaurs and humans lived during same period.
It'll never sell -- totally derivative.
Sure, he's making us money now, but if we kill him their market value will skyrocket.
As soon as he comes out, he's 'history'!
Not sure where he's from . . . Marge called the art school and asked if they had someone who dabbled in nature scenes.
How many times have i asked you to put your charcoal away before we go out?
What really riles me is that someday thousands of years from now they'll all think that we humans couldn't draw.......
He says he wants to depict cave people and our world before we become extinct.
I could draw him drawing but that would be too modern and ironic.
He is too avant-garde for a grotto.
Goddamn lizards always takin' our jobs
A decorator?! You really have caved man!
He’s a member of the Pre-Neanderthalite Brotherhood.
Piccassaurus, early period
Let him finish decorating before we eat him.
man, I wish we would have thought of that!
She's an artist, she's single, you should be happy to club her.
Let's check out what Dino has on the menu board tonight.
Who let the Sketchosaurus in?
His perspective is way off.
I think it's a memoir.
Plagiarism is the highest form of flattery.
*You* tell him!
Its a Fakenewsosaurus.
I thought it would be nice to have an artist in residence
Who said figurativism was extinct?
They've been around like 70 million years and they're still doing THIS?
What the heck?! We are definitely not that hairy!
Where do you imagine he gets his art supplies?
Evolution made these less childlike in the last 10, 000 years.
It may be a dinosaur but it prints really clear images.
Who knew you could do it without opposing thumbs?
That’s not art. That’s today’s menu!
Let me do all the talking.
Where there's charcoal, there must be fire.
You can't blame him for drawing us like that -- just look at the length of his arms!
My wife encourages it, she says it keeps him from playing with those nasty boys from the tar pits.
I think the brushstrokes who be more powerful if his arms were longer.
I think he has a good shot at winning that IQ contest at the White House, but if not we can certainly use him in the Senate
We ought to buy it now, before he gets famous.
I'm having him do the kid's bedroom next.
How do YOU know it's not Banksy?
That is just a copy of Dave’s work.
He wouldn't make fun of our hair if he knew winter is coming.
Finally! He’s stopped painting about that wretched fireball from the sky.
You had to hire an editor.
I like the menu.
He is strictly 'old school'.
I hate to say it, but he's way better than Thag.
Let's be sure to leave some homonid tools in this cave, just to confuse giant lizards of the future.
The archaeologists will never know.
It's as if he thinks it's the Prosaic period.
Don’t worry, when this gets discovered we’ll get credit.
Derivative.
Time for plan B
That looks nothing like us.
Evidently it's food group art, and we're in it.
Not again, fake news!
That’s not what I look like. Is it?
I'm starting to think this evolution theory is fake news?
Let's hold off--he does have a certain flair.
I don't think criticizing his art work is the right thing to do.
Brilliant artist, but no head for business.
Afterwards, I'll put out a statement citing "artistic differences"
We found him on Dino's List.
I say we kill him, eat him, and take credit for his work. We've entered the art age now.
Let's wait till he is done the horse, I can never get the head to look right.
It’s too modern for my tastes.
You see art. I see dinner.
He's compensating for his upcoming extinction.
Pretty derivative, if you ask me.
Seriously. When are we ever OFF his menu.
I find his art too primitive for my taste.
Notice how they all have over bites.
With proper marketing he's worth more alive than dead.
Ok, you really think someone will believe this.
I wish I had a walnut sized brain
I told you to copyright it.
Figurative art is so last epoch.
Maybe he knows the end is near.
In 40,000 years nobody will know the difference.
I can't wait to see his self-portrait.
Some day the Creation Museum will sort this all out.
Grocery list
His art is too primitive for my taste.
After he finishes we'll sign our names to it.
I just feel like his art was better in his Mesozoic period.
Is it just me, or is he aping us?
These paintings will be worth a lot of money when he's extinct.
Do we wait until he finishes the story?
I don't want to be known as the guy who stopped the Reptilian Renaissance.
Don't tell anybody.
See, now to you believe it wasn’t me.
I think we may have spotted Banksy.
Think of it this way, his art will be worth more after we eat him.
Graffiti? He’s a master of primitivism!
Once he's gone, we'll get the credit.
Is it still plagiarism if he's not human?
Maybe if we had an audio guide?
I think he is trying to confuse the future population of Kentucky
I'll admit he's impressive. I'm just not into primitive art.
I heard about some collectors snatching these up, betting the value will skyrocket after he's extinct.
The dietician told me to record what I had for dinner last night
I told you not to teach him to walk on two feet.
He's making out his supper menu.
He’s a survivor of the Picassozoic Era.
All I said was, "Try and draw us," Rex.
I thought we were the only species with opposable thumbs
It's decent work, but it's definitely derivative of the Jurassic Period.
Opposable thumbs are clearly over-rated.
It's his Pleistocene Chapel.
Don't pout; he promised to do your portrait next.
He said he's texting.
I think we should let him finish.
His kind will never learn perspective.
He works for scale.
So derivative! So jejune! No wonder he's going extinct.
Those pastels won't last very long.
Maybe with time his drawings will seem less esoteric.
Let's extinct him, then say they are ours.
We should try that.
He does that to screw with the heads of the paleontologists.
You critique, me watch.
He's pretty evolved for an extinct species.
It's a slippery slope, you know... graffiti one day, an art studio the next, then Sothoby's realty sign on your neigbhor's place... Better stop this before the property taxes goes up.
If we club him to death, we can take credit for this.
Art school? But I wanted him to become a doctor!
Ya see Mel, I was right... small, but right-brained.
Quick, let's get him before he signs them!
Well at least he's making it look like we're the dominant species
Looks like he's planning a buffet for dinner!
These Open Cave Studios can be hit or miss
I'm posing for him next. You'll just have to wait.
Yeah, but he's got a very limited sense of perspective.
It'll never catch on
Tetradactyls, bison, homosapiens, that should keep 'em guessing.
I hate to interrupt his artistic flow.
Either he admires our physiques or those are tonight's dinner specials.
He breathes fire, but he lives for his art.
pre-pre-primitivist
An artist is only appreciated after his death. Let's do it.
It'll sell better with him dead.
We'll probably get blamed for this.
My kid could do better than that.
I think it lacks imagination.
It's her late-creationism period.
It’s not avant-guard, it’s extinct.
That’s so literal.
What's the obsession sharing pictures of their meals in this new media?
And I thought all he could do was make fire.
Yeah, but I asked him to paint a wildebeest in mauve to match that boulder in my entryway and he got all haughty.
...and thats with out any lessons!!
what do you think wallets and gloves or purses
They say you can live forever through your art, but her career is about to become extinct.
If he disappears, we'll take credit for his work.
But I wanted wallpaper.
So, are you gonna tell him he’s extinct?
Shhh, it's a Tyrannodrawus.
Let's off him and put our handprints on the wall.
They have opposable thumbs?
They'll be gone soon and we'll get all the credit.
Those cave paintings are going to be worth a lot more after he is extinct.
We shouldn't let him be scorekeeper as well.
It's a cry for help
It's not cave drawings ,it's his grocery list .
They are going to think we produced that crappy art.
I requested abstract expressionism....
I think it's a menu for his new restaurant.
The paint set seems to have distracted him.
Should we tell him that he's plagiarising?
I told you they couldn't write.
Don't worry, only the Creationists will believe the dinosaurs did it.
They’re always worth more after they’re dead.
Shhh. On the count of three...Lascaux.
I brought in a freelancer for some fresh perspective.
This wall art would be worth more if one of us clubbed the dinosaur
Think about how much it'll be worth if they go extinct!
He not only stole my paint, but ate my model!
He calls himself "Banksy."
It does sort of warm it up a little.
He must be French. He acts like he's the first to ever draw on a wall!
He insists I never get the legs right
We also have several dozen specials.
Who would know if we knock him off and take the credit?
He’s in his portraiture phase.
It's defacement of public property, Carl." "No, Earl, it's art. You just don't like the artist.
He’s OK, but he’s no Keith Haring.
It's primitive, but it does have style.
Should we leave the anthropologists a clue.
Me forget lock back cave.
I told you not to tell him that the survival of his species is based on win, lose or draw!
So, looks like Fishies, Ptero and Hunters for small plates and assorted Fillies for mains.
Let's do him a favor and eat him before his blue period.
He's a rescue dinosaur, it's part of his therapy.
His early work reflected the Big Bang era.
I thought we were the most advanced.
Their menu is a little intimidating.
Now me understand the tiny hands.
History is not going to treat you and me favorably.
We didn't give them enough credit.
The first recorded use of Fake News
Let her finish, then we can take credit.
I never liked primitive art.
Waddya mean: You dig him??
These days everyone's an artist.
Who knew?
Will you shut the hell up about primitive realism?
Do you think she would do our portrait?
Forget It. It's an Artvark. They taste kind of sketchy.
"The new editor has the mind of a reptile".
If we kill them all, people will think we drew these.
I think he made me look too fat.
Dude, it's definitely the mushrooms.
Just adding some final touches to the decor before we move in.
I call it cultural appropriation.
Plagiarus Rex
He has a certain je ne sais quoi in his work that Og find very appealing.
The birth of graffiti.
What if we dig a big hole, and blame it on a comet?
And they save we are primative
I feel like this might be "Fake News"
I told you, Jerry... we are on his hit list. I knew your 'NICE LEGS' comment would come back to bite us.
I suggested that he start a food journal.
It may not be Lascaux, but the price was right.
The missing ink!
What if we put them on mugs and tee shirts?
He's a leftover from the Neo-Jurassic School .
Are you sure this is how we want to be remembered?
It's true; he's trying to make drawings of a pair of each creature before the Big Flood occurs.
They say he works for National Geographic.
all I see are new shoes
I'm not a fan of his work, extincts.
He calls them selfies.
We eat him and then claim that we invented cave drawing.
I say just leave him be; he's going to be extinct soon enough, anyway.
After we eat him, let's say we did it.
When he comes out, we'll hit him over the head, and everyone will think we drew it.
Me can't wait for captions!
He just said "Because it's there."
There he goes, sharing our business with the world, again.
Beats my stick man any day.
Uh-oh, they're evolving!
And we thought we were narcissistic
I don’t get their graffiti art, I just don’t.
Should we kill him and take all the credit ?
Ladies first.
It's an Artosaurus Rex!
These illegal animals keep stealing our jobs.
Wouldn't you say his approach is rather dated?
You know, if we get rid of him, I bet people will think we drew it.
Two days out of the animal shelter and he acts like he owns the place.
He is just showoff to confuse anthropologist
Representation in art is absolutely prehistoric.
I hear he’s a rising star in the new Primitive School.
It looks like something my kids could do.
'Would it be plagiarism if I initialed that drawing?"
It's a cartoon caption contest.
I'm not sure he's ready for a one-man show.
I like the way the primitiveness of his art accommodates violence and obsession within a rational framework.
He go... Me tag with handprint...Get Credit.
'Please dad! Get us an etchasaurus! We promise to clean up after it.' .... Right.
In my opinion, this paleolithic movement is a passing fad.
HE'S REVISING HIS LUNCHEON MENU AGAIN !!!
We're going to build a wall, and we're going to make them pay for it.
We regret to inform you that your work has not been naturally selected at this time.
It's called "primitivism."
I have a feeling that we're going get the blame for this.
Everyone is an artist these days
Once he’s extinct, they’ll be worth a fortune.
I dunno, Krog, it does kinda look like you.
Is that what they're calling postneolithic these days?
It's sad that with gentrification around here, he's going to be priced out of existence.
That guy Darwin from the other cave would be interested in this.
He needs to add some fresh vegetables and whole grains!
Shh...it's Banksysaurus.
You and I are in the same line of work. How can you afford an interior designer?
Let's kill him and appropriate his style.
It's a bit two-dimensional.
Let's give him a critiquing he'll never forget.
I just don't get contemporary art...
I bet you someday that style of art will go the way of the dinosaur.
Don't worry. You can wash it off. It's only water color
I said 'dine al fresco', not 'dino fresco'!
My pet project
Maybe we should just go out for dinner tonight?
Looks like a diet diary for Weight Watchers . . .
It's an Art-asaurus. They're gifted.
He really needs a girlfriend.
If anyone asks in 20 million years, we are the artist ones.
We're going to be overrun by tourists.
They're called 'Dinoglyphics'.
I always wondered what happened to my cousin.
No, he's drawing me next!
She posts pictures of all her meals. Time to attack, before we end up on that wall.
Our society's fiscal support for diversity and the arts is getting out of hand.
Did Darwin say he came before us or after us?
I know fossils with better taste.
As soon as he's done with the drawings, you hit him from behind and I'll sign my name at the bottom.
Now we know who killed Stan.
I'm cancelling his commission. I specifically told him to draw me as a gatherer not a hunter.
He's changing the menu for Restaurant Week.
Let's kill him. Eat him. and Take the credit!
Sure, and you let me think YOU did it!
Nah, let's just learn it ourselves.
And you thought is was Banksy
He's an early 'extinctionist' artist.
He keeps writing stuff on The Wall and expecting us to Like it
It's either a shopping list or bragging rights-I can't figure out which.
You'll like this guy. He doesn't use PowerPoint.
Careful, it might be "fake news".
I believe it's a Picassosaurus.
Menu.
I hope we don't get blamed for that.
Just because we don't have a word for appropriation doesn't mean it's ok.
We're hungry. Sometimes it's ok to separate the art from the artist.
He might be a great storyteller, but he's not a very nice dragon.
He's been like this ever since the mammals took over.
My female calls him an interior decorator!
You hired an interior decorator without telling me?
Orgg like new publicist. He fake news good.
I say we club first; ask questions later.
Sorry, you really do look that unintimidating.
And, Fred.... you should see his pastels.
Those will be worth even more after that meteor hits.
Do you think he captured the real me?
Drawing on walls? How primitive.
I don't know what it is doing; we better kill it.
Seems to me his themes merely fulminate at the margins of art-world convention. Also, he ate Zog!
Have you noticed that Frank’s murals always add 10 pounds to my face?
In a million years they will think we drew them
He’s self actualizing and if we don’t take him out now, we could become a second rate species.
It's his remembrance of things past...
I think they are called 'selfies.'
Shhh ! ... They'll be worth a fortune when he's extinct.
I don't see a future in this for him.
He's still our dinner.
I call it... Plagarism!
Just another menu-on-the-wall restaurant
Shh. Wait 'til he leaves. Then we'll tell the others we drew it.
I really wish these graffiti artists would go extinct.
Keep quiet and we might get credit for this.
So, is he bragging or complaining?
You know, it's getting tougher to be an art critic every day.
He thinks he's Michelangelo painting the Sistine Chapel.
Claims to be a futurist.
Is that all he thinks about? Food?
Don't worry, we're still going to get credit.
Weird. They’re usually left-handed.
His mother's a neanderthal.
First the lizartists move in, then the rents go up.
What a great idea! He is putting the menu options on the wall for customers!
When I traded fire for her I thought we'd make little cave people together, but now all she wants to do is draw those pictures.
Who's the top of the food chain?
His art therapy sessions helped him reconcile with his 'tyrannical' past.
Dammit, I just painted that wall
Somehow I don't feel flattered.
I think we’ve found the guy to invent the wheel.
SO YOU SEE...HE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT COMPOSITION
Not his best work.
It's better than letting your mother decorate for us, Paul.
He always gets the Mesozoic mixed with the Pleistocene period
It's annoying, that's what that is.
He's popular now, but it's just a fad and he'll be gone in a year.
Neo-mesozoic is so last century.
The agreement was you could have a pet if it didn't scribble on the walls.
Luckily he’ll be extinct in a few years or we’d never live this down.
I thought all they could draw were flies.
If we eat him, we can take credit for the drawings and rest easier at night.
I'm telling you it's nothing new. Fake news has been around forever.
After pea-brain leaves, we sign our names. Someday we'll be famous.
I guess all those art lessons were worth it.
Why is Eleanor's picture on your wall?
At least he's not an abstract expressionist.
He's a living fossil -- he still uses Adobe.
Get your club ready. My plan will get us credit for the cave art.
Just think what it will be worth after he's extinct!
He's also a prolific reader.
I can tell already that this artist is not going to be appreciated in his time.
I say we kill him, eat him, sign our name to his work, and give future Creationists a really bad day.
I don't think he's captured the human condition.
A bit too primitive if you ask me.
Do you think that's Banksy?
When he dies we'll make a fortune.
Maybe we can beat him to the punchline..
And he calls himself a home decorator.
He seems to be a little behind the times.
You won't be able to afford him once he's extinct.
It's his evolutionary thesis.
Chalk it up to cultural appropriation.
Great illustrations, but the plot is a bit narrow.
He's pretty good but he's no Ug.
It's a shame his art will only be appreciated when he's dead.
Wife hire new decorator. Don't laugh, caves he paint sometime resell for two, three sand dollar!
ACTUALLY HE WANTED TO BE A CUBIST.
This guy will have the Smithsonian fooled.
As pornographers go, he's a dying breed.
Yes, I felt his abstract phase had more gravitas, but I don't him evolving past this trendy stuff.
Although he was already well established, Dino still found it overwhelming when curators from the Museum of Mesozoic Art ("MOMA) visited his workshop
They will be worth more after he is dead.
I know it's your turn, but I could really use some new loafers
Look, I know you're a shaman, but you've really got to be more careful with this temporal displacement stuff.
1 meterorite away, and we will be the dominant species.
Are they updating the menu?
For God's sake, who cares if you like his work? He ate Mary and three of your kids!
I keep telling him that Primative arealism is passé.
His new work is very post prehistoric
A caricature of us? I don't care. When he finally goes extinct his prices are going to go through the roof!
I told her a million times, if she doesn't sign them her husband's going to get all the credit.
Alright lets take him by surprise and then we'll take all the credit
Since the dawn of time, immigrants have been stealing American jobs.
Quite frankly, I prefer abstract to representational.
How's about we knock him off and take the credit?
Now let us invent typewriter and give to monkey.
Let him go, he's making us look good.
Ugh. Just illustration. Art not invented yet.
They won't last.
You know we're going to be the ones they blame for coloring on the cave walls.
It spoils the whole man cave motif.
He used to do murals but lately he's been scaling back.
I feel sorry we have to whack him.
I prefer his earlier, more experimental work.
Do you think those primitive drawings will acquire value after his extinction or should we just cover them with wallpaper after he leaves?
After the meteor hits we'll take credit for it.
That pterodactyl should keep them guessing for years to come.
If you think that's impressive, you should see what 1000 chimpanzees can do.
I told the decorator I wanted a more post-modern look.
You take ‘em out. I’ll sign my name.
Says he wants to make his mark,reckons something will happen
Other than this stuff, it’s a clean pet.
For the last time, a petroglyph is carved into stone while a pictograph is painted on it.
I'm not really into the paleo diet. Let's get Chinese.
You eat what you kill, not what you draw.
So it turns out Anonymous was a dragon!
How do you like my rex room?
Once we've wiped them out, we can develop an anthropocentric paradigm.
Nobody's collecting him now.
It's in the lease: No pets!
Who said he could draw on our wall?
I can't stand these Neolithicists and their cavalier approaches no man-versus-nature themes.
Sure we’ll sign it. He’ll be extinct anyway.
Nobody graffitis on my cave and gets away with it.
Does that one on the left look like me? Maybe I'll skip the hunt tonight......
And to think, just yesterday he was on there himself.
Looks like the General is borrowing some well thought out strategy from World War III again.
A million years from now they're gonna blame us for those doodles!
Oh, he’s our new artist in residence
He's a real Dinotello.
She's on loan from the Creation Museum.
You said the handwriting was on the wall!
It's OK, but Rembrandt he ain't.
Let's make him extinct before that graffiti drives property values down.
I guess that's his interpretation of what happened
You wait! Someday I bet we’ll be blamed for that mess.
Donald Trump is a jackass.
Three months before the flood, all that was going on? I had no idea.
He's printing up the menu for the week.
It all started with ancestry.com.
He calls it Art, but I know Grafitti when I see it.
His work is evolving.
Huh, who knew? Banksy's a lizard.
I say let him finish the wall, then eat him.
Imagine what he could create with opposing thumbs!
This ones okay, but the hunting theme is so yesterday.
The art fellowship rules actively encourage non-Neanderthal participation.
Let's ask him to draw what comes after us.
Don't disturb him. His opening is next week.
I think his work's derivative.
It's really quite derivative of her earlier work
He calls it a Selfie.
I've got a great idea: put up a sign that says "MOMA- Museum of Monster Art" and we'll charge people 25 bucks for admission.
He paints like a child.
Its value will increase when he's extinct.
So easy a dinosaur could do it.
That's plagiarism.
It is not done well; but you are surprised to find it done at all.
They say that in each picture he camouflages the word "dino".
Once he's extinct, we can take credit for the drawings.
The faster we kill him the less time it’ll take to rewrite history...
Decoraptors may be on the brink of extinction, but this "wallpaper" concept's got real legs.
I'll bonk him good. You lay the groundwork for future anthropologists to attribute complex representational thought, manual dexterity, and aesthetic intention to anatomically-modern hominids.
It lacks a human element.
Can we auction this stuff once he’s extinct?
You pretend to admire the art while I sneak up behind him.
His realism is reminiscent of the Cro-Magnon period. Too bad the rest of his species is extinct.
I hear he’s showing at the Museum of Pre-Modern Art next month.
The paintings will become extremely valuable once the asteroid arrives.
Did he cite your work?
It's a Trumpasaurus. They prefer pictures.
He got Og and Gog. Now he's got their horses, too?
Just my graduate student.
I name Doodlesaurus.
Leave him alone. In a few thousand years we'll get all the credit.
Let him keep drawing. They’ll be worth more when he’s extinct.
We have to put an end to this. We can't wait for something to fall out of the sky.
He calls them Emojis.
He does have the advantage of an outside perspective.
An artist, yes-- but one whose work is somewhat primitive. I say we bop him.
Zero tolerance on graffiti, I say. We don't want future generations thinking we're uncouth.
It’s a graffitisaurus!
I told you he's a carnivore.
Let's scat before we end up on his trophy wall!
Frankly, his work is getting too surrealist for me.
I don’t know about you ,but I think It looks like fake news .
Lately we've been investing in art that's more representational.
But will it make him happy?
A starving young artist he’s not.
I hope we're never given credit for this crap.
It´s OK, but the Cro-Magnon guy over at Altamira has better technique.
Well no wonder they are going extinct. All they do is stand around and draw pictures.
His last painting brought a prehistoric record price for contemporary art
The tagging has started - we're going to have to move.
I tell ya, they'll be worth more when he's dead!
He calls himself a Gnu Age artist.
Anybody else getting tired of her Pre-Meteoric phase?
Sure he's weird, but think of the resale value.
Nobody's going to remember these started out as a menu.
I mean, the story doesn't seem to flow here.
They call it "liz-art".
Great artists copy, good artists steal.
So now he wants to be called Picassosaurus--sheesh!
Everything is based on perspective
Somebody's gotta do something about this spread of fake news...
He’s nearly finished. Time to invent white wine for the opening.
He's gotta go. He's out-evolving us.
"Leave him alone. This is museum quality".
I figure this artwork could be worth a fortune when he becomes extinct!
His first love was graffiti but he couldn't spell his own name.
He used to just draw flies.
There’s got to be a way to take credit for this.
I told you not to leave the chalk out!
Please tell me you got him the washable cave ink.
Looks like we have to call the exterminator again.
Don't try to stop me. I'm calling the Vatican.
I don't undestand Modern Art.
That species will never be able to make a living.
That asteroid better hurry up or we’re in real trouble
We have have one shot to flip the script.
You tell him he's just "copying."
It’s Banksy!
Seems like a waste of time, no one is ever going to see it.
Do we kill him or hire him?
He’s keeping a food diary.
You just know we're going to get the blame.
What a mess. I hope no one blames us.
I know he's not a lap-dragon, but we've already bonded and he's staying.
Artisauris, smartisauris. I call him lunch.
No archeologist will ever believe us.
Do you think we are in it.
His Shrink says that drawing will keep him from eating us.
Now it's bipedalism? One more ism and I'm registering independent.
I hate when he paints his menu on our living room wall!
Call it'evolution'or'artistic design'.
Leave him alone. It's not like anyone will ever see these anyway.
And you thought art was extinct!
We may as well. No one would believe us anyway.
It'll be worth more when he's dead.
We’re gonna get blamed for this.
We should just take the credit.
All she ever thinks about is food.
Never trust an interior designer with short arms.
Last night he cut off an ear...
He better retouch my thighs.
He’s so lucky we’re on the Paleo diet!
We have some specials tonight. May I pull up a chair?
Does this drawing make me look fat?
He's too talented to eat.
I thought Artasaurs only lived in lofts
Dino Esposito!
These could be worth something some day.
He likes to draw a picture of his food to share and compare with his friends. Those are pictures of Charlie and Bernice in the middle. You will notice he only has a picture of their backs since they were running away.
Perhaps it was premature to declare figurative art extinct?
Nobody likes a show-off.
It proves my theory about a monkey and a typewriter.
They say cave painting is a dying art!
I didn't know they had opposable thumbs
Caveman 1: Let’s beat her senseless, take credit for her art, and call it a cultural revolution. Caveman 2: We’re so evolved.
It's from his Anachronistic Period.
Gary Larson would have drawn the dinosaur better.
Yeah, he can draw -- but he can't roar or maim worth a damn.
Let's have him finish our office art. After we club him, we won't have to worry about paying him.
He's talented...I've seen his art in metropolitan caves.
I would give it a good review.
So you're saying that we HAVE to give credit to the original artist when we repost?
"It's something he call,s 'art nouveau'".
Wrong millenium.
I may be hairy, but I'm not THAT hairy.
Would look great in your cave...
Our paleo diet says we can't eat this guy.
Some people call it graffiti, i like to think of it as art.
I told you it was a Crayolasaurus.
It's meta.
It's ridiculous; every hunting season my wife gets the decorative wall painters in
Told you those drawings were counterfeit.
Another one of those artsy-fartsy types!
That sets the creation of the earth at six thousand years.
Are we the hunters or the hunted?
He ate the artist during his performance piece.
You call THAT art?
Interesting, yes. But I prefer his earlier work.
It’s the beginning of the dino-expressionism period.
Yeah, he's good, but what will it look like in a hundred years?
Sure he's your pet. But if we kill him, we get credit for inventing rock art.
We need an audio guide.
I don't think much of his color palate.
Pete, I'm gonna be honest. I'm confused.
We've got nothing to worry about -- it's just an avocation for him.
Claim he died millions of years ago just so you can steal credit for his work? That's a new low, even for you.
I do not copy his work—it’s just one of myriad sources of inspiration.
Maybe if you’d landed that audition with Geico we could afford better interior design.
Now that he is on PBS his work is reaching a much wider audience.
But he's not drawing to scale!
In three days he ate a Pterodactyls, a fish, three water buffalo and Morris and Sidney and no, I'm not feeling your parietal art appreciation at all right now...
I believe he was self-taught.
And you thought we had a wonderful stone age free of fake news, ha!
Look, If we don't get rid of them, there goes our future status as the intelligent species.
I say we begin persecuting this artist RIGHT now.
Such a show-off. Like anyone's going to care 20,000 years from now.
Just wait until her father gets home.
That's what happens when we go away for 3 months and leave the cave door open.
Good for resale value
You hired a Graffiti Rex?
And then they'll blame us.
He says he feels compelled to leave his mark
Didn't you tell him we were having a girl.
"I've hired an interior decorator".
This disproves evolution.
Do you think that we can finally fool the evolutionists with our artist in residence?
He's very talented, but I'm not sure he's going to make it.
Let him draw. The last guy to criticize his drawing got eaten!
He’s got to stop watching Bob Ross...
Want to go to his cooking class tomorrow?
She's a bit too realist for my taste...
Hey, the art lessons have really paid off for our little Dino!
I could tell that wasn't your handwriting.
Forget the clubs. It's going to take an act of God to bring this guy down.
Yea, You're Right....Outsider Art
I thought Grafitisaurus' were extinct?
Perhaps the gentleman would prefer the 'kiddie' menu?
All icon, no clastic.
He won't let us in until he's finished…you know how these interior designers are.
But is it truly “modern” if it’s done by a big lizard?
Personally I prefer hunting over art appreciation.
I told you it was fake news!
I have a feeling he won't get credit for it.
We're safe until he runs out of wall!
Relax. Who do you think will get credit for it.
It's like he sees into my soul!
I prefer his earlier, abstract work. Now, those captured modernity.
Oh my apologies that's the lunch menu... Let me get you the full dinner menu.
Who’s gonna tell him it’s not the pattern we picked out?
He's pretty good.
Well done, Holmes! We’ll catch our plagiarist and eat him too!
Much too primitive for my cave!
The writing's on the wall: bye-bye dinos, here come the cavemen!
The original Paleo.
You have to ask yourself. "Why dinosaurs Paint?"
He is plagiarizing your work.
He's the last one of his kind but he claims "emojis" are gonna be the next big thing.
Harrumph, I could have drawn those!
He really captured your eyes.
I told you he draws everyone with the same haircut.
Dude, the fat one is definitely you.
Artists are not like other people.
Dang! We gotta step up our game.
Let's club him and take credit for the art.
Once he leaves, we'll put our fingerprints in the paint.
See, Mike, these days everyone thinks they can be an artist.
I regret having sent him to art school. We just repainted the cave and he’s out of control.
We probably shouldn't eat our historian.
The wife has Mr. Lascaux redecorating my man cave.
And it was then we realized history is a sham.
Just think, someday we’ll be able to say ‘we knew him when’.
I don't think he's telling our story. It's his dinner menu.
His style has really evolved over the years....
Remember Bob, cave paintings always add 10 pounds.
Don’t worry. These artistic types are a pushover.
We slay him, nobody knows it's not us.
You let him out of your sight for five minutes...
Someday it'll be worth millions at Sotheby's. How do you steal a wall?
hey wait a minute, we don't exist yet
I’m just concerned that if anyone ever finds these, they’ll think we did them.
He's of a different era.
Eh, I think it looks kinda primitive.
Where did you find your decorator?
I said, "Get him an Etch-A-Sketch", but you said, "No, give him crayons". We've created a monster!
He's about to become extinct, but his artwork will make him immortal.
Did he gives us spears again?
He had me at fish.
There's no way it has staying power.
I am telling you man, it is the communication of the future.
The Graffitiosaurus is at it again. He never gets my nose right.
Is it important? Probably not.
Hey, he's no Picasso, so lets eat him.
Good artists copy. Great artists steal.
The bottom one is John, no question. I am not sure about the other one.
It's still his early work.
He charges a mammoth leg for commission.
I thought you said they couldn't use tools.
... so we decided to hire an Interior Dinosaur
It's amazing. He just used to grunt and chase females, but then he evolved.
Geez, she just got past stick figures. Give her a little time for impressionism.
Unfortunately, I think it's a menu.
We better do something fast, before we end up on that wall.
If we get rid of him, they will think we did the drawings
O.K., but we'll take credit for the drawings anyway.
See—I meant "lizard brain" as a compliment!
He is reporting us to the game warden!
He's putting up the lunch menu as we speak.
I look good but you don't want to know how bad he drew you.
You should never have given him that first taste of meat.
Not your normal starving artist, by the looks of it.
When is it gonna be OUR turn?
Don't you think it's about time that we pay him for his internship?
I told you they were teaching evolution in schools!
What does that say about our taste if we eat the artist.
Hey, let's just check out the menu.
You left the paints out again, didn't you.
Primitive art you say? I say cultural appropriation!
Looks like life imitating art to me
Let's kill him and take credit for his work.
Damn it! I told him not to paint in the living room.
Let's see what's for dinner"
Damn, you're right! He IS posting surveilled data about us on his wall.
Well, he ain't no Bob Ross.
Be gentle with your criticism, these artists are very sensitive.
He says he'd like more light in his studio, but he can't beat the rent
I can't tell if he's vegan or paleo...
HIS WORK CAME HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, BUT I THINK HE JUST ATE THE KIDS
We better nip this in the bud.
Og kill, Gork open museum.
His work is a little derivative, but he’s cheaper than an interior decorator.
Extinction trumps cultural appropriation.
Nice handwriting, but terrible spelling.
She said: "Wanna come up and see my etchings?"
The thing about being a white male is no matter how sh**tty his drawings are we'll get the credit
They'll never believe this, in a hundred million years.
Once the meteor hits, this will be worth millions.
Well for one, everybody knows that humans and pterodactyls never coexisted.
His paintings will be worth a fortune after he's extinct!
Asteroid showers in the forecast or not, now we have to evict them.
If we lose his caption contest one more time, the dinosaur is going extinct.
There's no way he's getting his cleaning deposit back.
The wife thought our cave needed some interior decorating and she was cheaper than the wallpaper lizard.
It won't be a successful opening. He hasn't kept up with the evolution of styles.
I know, I know: every painter paints himself, but jeez.
Our deal with him is that when the nursery is done, it's back on.
It’s always gossip and fake news! I say we club him before he posts anything else to his wall!
Next it'll be PowerPoint on the cave wall just to mess with future academics.
Why can't we draw like that?
I haven't seen a drawasaurus in years!
Any idea when we can expect the next big asteroid?
I give ‘em one more eon, two at best
That's Thag, my ghost writer.
He ate the dog, now this!
Better in here than out there.
Ugh. We are witnessing the beginnings of Fake News .
He got it wrong -- I'm not left-handed!
Dinosaur only copy Og. Creationism only half right.
Are we on today’s specials again?
What are we waiting for? You get the tail, I get the head.
See, I told you they were harmless.
Once he leaves we can both sign it and take credit
They're calling it avant-garde. I say we leave it and design the furniture around it
How's Darwin gonna explain this???
I suppose it's considered primitivism, since cubism hasn't been invented yet.
We better not get blamed for that.
Let's see what's on the menu.
Ogg the Merciless Critic was right, this guy is a brilliant primitivist
It helps him blow off steam from his day job in banking, at Gringotts.
I bet it's so easy, a caveman could do it.
I thought Grafitisaurus' were extinct?
Nature or nurture?
They say history is written by the victors...
It's a time traveler!
He has a cave opening next week.
I can't wait till they invent wallpaper.
Should we tell him those aren't what we're hunting this season?
I hear the dinosaur hieroglyphic artists are a dying breed.
No skill - practice in cave, I tell him. You'll go extinct before anyone notices, I tell him. Sad.
All I know is that when I left a month ago, someone was giving a workshop here called 'Discover the Artist Within You.'
See! I told you there were lizard people.
They don't even understand proper proportion and perspective, to say nothing of shadows.
He ate the last artist in residence.
Everyone is a critic!
It got a "genius" grant.
Evolutionarily-speaking, it shouldn't be standing upright either.
"Artist-in-Residence" does not mean he lives in my home.
Okay, we'll sneak up behind him with our erasers
Dramatic foreshadowing. Spears must be about to be invented.
For my money I don’t think these modernists are going to last.
I knew it! I knew his son wasn't doing those paintings!
I expected Banksy to be, at the very least, human.
This will really throw them a few thousand years from now.
No, I still don't believe he's "Banksy".
Wilma's gonna be pissed. She wanted water color.
If this ever leaks, National Geographics will end our royalties!
He has such poor command of light and shadow. Nobody can even tell that it's you and me in the picture.
He comes highly recommended on Cave Advisor's interior decorators.
So what's next, she sleeps between us?
How did it get charcoal without fire?
Alvin's journaling again.
Who created the earth and left HIM in charge?
Annoying yes but not dangerous just a Graffitisauros.
Primitive naive. But what did you expect?
And he's even using perspective.
Oh, don't be impressed: the genre is dated.
We should have him paint that big rock in the sky.
He draws in a Pre-Basquiat style.
No Og, how about YOU ask him to leave!
In the era when dinosaurs dominated interior design
I warned you, Myrna, NO MORE OF THIS MODERN ART!!!
Paintings do furnish a cave but Man can't live on Art alone.
What did you expect from a pea-brain, the Mona Lisa?
Sorry, Jerry. Not only is he replacing you as Tribe Graphic Artist....he also laughed when I told him which art school you attended.
Well I'll be dammed ,you can teach an old dog new tricks
When she slammed her tail twice I thought she understood we wanted abstract.
Yeah, but can he talk?i
Didn't you hear? Glog's pterodactyl is getting his own show.
You break his opposable thumbs, I'll steal his crayons.
I told you the art classes would mellow him out.
They're much bigger in real life.
If we whack him now, in five thousand years they'll think we did it.
Fake News B.C.E.
My daughter told me he was in law school.
It's total crap, but if they go extinct we could make a killing.
Surprisingly sophisticated for someone so unevolved
I was against commissioning a reptile at first, but his work was highly recommended.
I find his work menacing/playful because of the way the disjunctive perturbation of the negative space contextualize the eloquence of the pieces.
I told you we were being followed.
She's the new interior designer and says this is the latest rage in al fresco cave art.
That's it! He's in time out!
I vote we wait till he's filled up the whole gallery.
I knew that Throg was plagiarizing.
He posts pictures of every meal he eats. Those two just to his left were to die for.
And he can give us an insurance quote in 15 minutes or less.
It's a genre from the Paleoartocene.
He keeps babbling that he wants to leave something for "posterity".
You can call them pictographs if you want, but to me it's just graffiti and must be stopped.
When we develop fire we can show them at night and charge admission.
Are you being paid to model too?
Our wives, kids & History will mock us if we bring down another Artisticus Rex. I say we keep after the Orange Tyranus who's been crapping all over the neighborhood.
Well, history isn't always drawn by the victors.
You tell Daenerys." " No, you tell her.
What even is that? A dinosaur? God, this is so fucked.
Yes, he draws well. But I'm afraid those are his dinner plans.
One day we're gonna get blamed for this.
I know they say he's the best, but this sure doesn't look like Mid-Century to me.
I told you he was right-handed. Now Lascaux to our other cave.
The daily specials: I recommend the pterodactyl.
He's ruining my masterpiece!
So who knew they were menus?
Not to worry: it'll be extinct and we'll get the credit.
Representational art is so late Cretaceous period, don't you agree?
Maybe we can draw him out.
Drat, he beat us to it!
Maybe our species is headed the wrong way.
Just say you like it and he won't eat us.
But how do you get it home?
He was with Gaugin in Tahiti.
Yes, but I own the copyright.
My wife is gonna be pissed.
Did you tell your wife that you hired an interior decorator to paint the nursery?
Not very original.
It’s risky, because clearly he isn’t a STARVING artist.
This is not Banksy!
I don't think he knows 140 characters
Well, he's no Picasso
See? We did coexist with dinosaurs.
Primitive? Outsider? All I know is he is mucking up my wall!
We should take his art class first.
We shouldn't have rushed to judgment. It wasn't Larry after all.
Obvious fake news.
Her short stories are terrific, but the novels have a lot of gratuitous violence and lack character development.
Super weird - why a fish out of water?
I hear service is good, but their dinner menu is a little sketchy.
He said it's mixed-media!
Leave him alone. He could make this into a major tourist attraction.
He's been in there for three hours. Can't make up his mind. Such a dinosaur.
Great! When our wives come home, we're going to get blamed for it.
and he has an exhibition on the modern life of cavemen next week
It looks like he hunts exactly what we hunt.
He got your nose completely wrong
This would blow Darwin's theory out of the water -- too bad no one will know.
This evolutionary branch stops right here.
After he finish den we eat him!
Do you think he owns the copyrights for it?
He is clearly the breakout artist of the Upper Paleolithic period but I got him from the shealter for hunting.
Walks upright, has opposable thumbs and creative thought...let's eat.
His art harks back to an earlier era.
I say we become his agents first. Then we break his legs.
When she's done, we'll kill her and sign our names.
Hard to believe anything on two legs could be that stupid.
'Wow, now that's pre-primitive art!'
Let's club it to death.
Some pets do tricks you know.
Those are good but her watercolor primitives are the best.
Let's come back later. These cave drawings tend to drag on.
Let's not let this get out.
Nobody will know and we can get the credit
His psychiatrist told him to take up a hobby.
He's part of the realist movement - the couple a few caves over recommended him
My wife hired him to do a mural for the den.
When we adopted him they said he went to a Montessori school and that we should let him express himself.
Actually a hybrid. The famous Croc-Magnon.
And this one comes complete with an Interior Designosaur.
It's sleeping with my wife.
So that's why there are no signatures.
Og says he's a great artist, but I think that's a croc.
It is so cold-blooded how he paints his victims.
You hire a therapod to decorate your newborn baby's bedroom and yet you still wonder why homosapiens continue to stereotype us neanderthals.
Her work will be worth a fortune after she goes extinct.
Rare meat plus posthumous art, we are about to make a killing.
It's a memo to his spouse of what he'll try to bring home for dinner.
Personally, I prefer his Post Neanderthal Blue Period
He captured your eyes perfectly.
Yes, I'm also impressed by her refined technique, but I'm more concerned that "Cretaceous: Dawn of a New Age" won't evolve past the themes she explored in her last piece.
Can't be, Wikipedia says they've been extinct for 65 million years.
I think it's supposed to be primitive.
Marge calls it "modern". I call it "a hell of a lot of money for something with no obvious evolutionary purpose."
Your chase scene is next where the longhorn gets you.
What's next, a giant meteor that wipes out the face of the Earth?
Definitely put that in the category of fake news.
The ones that draw pictures cook up really tender.
I disagree, his use of color conveys a perspective both dull and tepid .
A little too derivative for my taste...
Darwin is turning in his grave.
And his art will increase in value after his death.
When did you say that asteroid was coming?
See? Study Fire Science in school good. Study Art, die from club on head.
I'm not getting it, it's probably Darwin's Witnesses!
Now remember, no comments about composition or line weight.
He's pretty good if you like representational art.
Didn't you tell him that we're not paying for interior decorating.
I don't get modern art.
He says we weren't drawing them accurately.
The reptilian brain is truly a marvel.
The birth of domesticated animals
I hate revisionist historians.
The irony is breathtaking.
See? Selfies. Again. And she never gets them the way she likes the first time so she spends hours trying to get it right.
I get that its art too, but this graffiti stuff just really drives down the property value.
The size of that print makes the space look even smaller.
No Og, I don't think you can call it Post Modern.
Early Cultural Appropriators
These artist-type are so reclusive you'd think they're extinct.
That's so 60 million years ago.
Sure, he's good, but he will never make any money at it!
I didn't know he could stand on two legs!
He’s an impressionist. He hasn’t got a Spinosaurus bone in his body.
Early plagiarism.
Sentient schmentient, I wanna wallop something.
I've found that most artists never get the recognition they deserve
Look! It’s a BobRossasaur!
Let wait until he finishes painting the house.
He's why cavemen drew on walls?
You know who they’re gonna blame, don’t you?
The Dawn of Creationism.
They'll think it was us.
He’s recommending that new restaurant by the river.
If he asks for more art supplies one more time, he's going on the endangered species list.
First they outsourced our manufacturing, now they're outsourcing our journalism?
Now if he can just breathe fire our job is done.
Let's kill him and claim we did them.
I'll take it if the lease includes pest extermination and a paint job.
Crayonosaurus Kilroy - they're all over the place!
'Don't worry, we'll still get the credit for it"
Don't take it personally, Larry. Artistic skill is purely a quirk of genetics--and we just don't have it.
I thought you were just being modest when you said you weren't the one behind the paintings.
You know, this paleo diet thing is pretty overrated. Are you up for trying some homemade Dino burgers and fries instead?
We look better in profile.
He has the aesthetic of a Neanderthal.
I think they're trying to represent us as the hunted.
He changes the decor just to irritate me, but I’ll be damned if I’m going to find another cave.
Never thought I'd be so impressed by something that wants to kill me
Rock, paper, scissors to decide who goes in to tell him there's only one moon.
20,000 years from now they will think we created them.
See? I told you our guys aren't smart enough to do those drawings.
The only way to stop them from writing all that fake news is to kill them all.
First things first, he’s a realist.
Charles Schulz, he's not.
He can´t speak, we´ll take the credit.
People are going to think these were cave man drawings.
He's trying to fool furure anthropologists.
Remember, a gallery report is more a review than an exhaustive essay.
"Somebody needs another timeout"!
We have to address the graffiti problem, immediately. It's a "quality of life" crime.
You club him and I’ll sign our names on the art.
Let him finish, then we'll eat him...
Too much competition. Let's exterminate him.
While her representations are good, I've always found them a little too cold blooded.
It'll double in value once he's dead.
I don't get this modern art. Let's club it into extinction.
He's good, but mine are better!
They said they have "artistic" intelligence.
I don't see why he's highly recommended.
I detect a lack of fresh fruits and vegetables in his diet.......
Cut him a break. In a few months he'll be extinct.
I always thought the graffitisaurus was extinct.
I thought we were the ones who got to paint on the walls.
"Its work is too accomplished to be considered primitive".
He's too avant garde for my taste.
I heard he's feuding with the T-Rex so he's been drawing him with cartoonishly small arms.
Don't worry. When they're involved like that they never hear you coming.
Then we can go on in and sign it.
Are you sure he's a forward thinker, or just hungry?
It's those mushrooms.
Do you think we could get him to do the baby’s room?
He's our new visiting artist.
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.
Evolution? Creationism? I just want my markers back!
An interesting take on Postmodernism, isn't it? You really have to appreciate his artistic vision." "I think he just likes to draw what he eats.
Let's bump him off and say we did it.
I told you they were fakes
He couldn't wait to use the new crayon color.
You pose first.
You say Artosaurus? I say it’s a talented guy in a lizard suit.
One day, this will be known as his ahistorical period.
Yeah art doesn't pay well, but he's been here so long the place is still under rent control.
BANKSYSAURUS
Her new paintings are more valuable, but I prefer her primitive phase.
It’s okay as long as he doesn’t sign it.
Do these drawings make me look fat?
He's always showing off his evolution.
Don't bother. You'll waste your time and he'll just throw away his potential chasing after a girl. Trust me.
What do you say we club him and in a few hundred thousand years take credit for his work?
There goes the neighborhood...
He was cheaper than hiring someone to wallpaper the cave.
Oh, he's got an eye, but there's a certain... coldness to his work.
You can't eat art.
You hit. Me take credit for art.
He comes highly recommended, but there’s a waiting list I’m afraid...
Yeah, cartoonists are becoming dinosaurs...
We were going to eat him, but his work is an airy but dark commentary on contemporary gender roles.
I think he makes you look good, Todd. I hope he remembers to Photoshop my stomach.
He said he’d throw in the nursery walls and ceiling for an extra saber-tooth. Named Mikangelorus.
They replaced us with a dinasaur??
Years from now, we'll get the blame for all this graffiti.
And they can eat you too.
We really need to train him to do his artistic business outside.
She's creative, but not much of a cook.
He's just bragging to his friends about things he's eaten
I'm not liking what I see about the substitute Art teacher!
The least he could have done was invite us to pose.
It's ok....you only need to worry when you're NOT on the wall.
The lazy guy wants US to come up with the caption.
Let's knock this fucker out and tell Werner Herzog we drew the horses.
I prefer Tricasso.
If dinosaurs were interior designers.
He started doing this after he ate Moe
I hate art, but the champagne and canapes are marvelous.
I'm hungry and prefer not to think about the historical consequences.
I'm more into Modern Art.
That level of culture is going to rewrite our history!
What sets him apart is his sense of scale.
When the asteroid hits, they'll think we did it.
My skin is not thick enough to wade through the artist criticism.
He seems to remember all our faces!
This is Oscar’s place. Food’s great. Check out this week’s specials.
Looks like the vandalizard is back.
Only real dinosaurs still make representational art.
Just another alternative fact.
I love art. Let's let him finish before we eat him.
He just moved in and he already thinks he can draw on the wall.
I think he is ordering lunch.
Big deal..he didn't include the Neolithic spiral.
I look so fat in that depiction; I really hope it doesn't stick around.
Quiet! The Senator is woking on his campaign speech.
She wants to do a novel, but she needs to find a bigger cave.
I hear it's a rapidly developing art form.
He must be a sketchasaurus
Spot has always preferred non fiction, but I hadn’t realized he was an aspiring author.
He's good but at least we will get the credit
It was a privilege to hire her. She’s part of a dying breed!
Millennia from now, they will think we did those ugly cave drawings.
I don't know. Seems derivative to me.
When did he get an opposable thumb?
Since when did he move in?
The archaeologists will never guess.
Its apparently related to a Steve Bannon candidate selection process.
Paleolithic-modern, he calls it.
He's no Grandma Moses
Don't get your clubs dirty, next week is the end of the Mesozoic era!
Representation?” “Naw, just food porn
He is NOT left handed like you! He's ambidextrous.
Why in God's name did you let him roam around the cave?
What about copyright law?" "Ex post facto wise, I think we're in the clear.
I didn't realize that I was so high waisted.
They say his IQ is over a hundred.
Good cavemen imitate, great cavemen club their competition.
Beats me, but, he’s popular with the ladies.
We can’t let her take the credit...
Pablo Picassaur over here.
Tell me again how mom died?
The Rise of Homo sapiens: Okay, so after he falls asleep, you run in and rub his sticks together really fast until they disintegrate. Maybe then, he'll finally stop drawing on the walls.
Two months staying with the in-laws while the remodelers dawdle.
After it teaches us about the wheel, fire, and writing, I say it's high time your wife finally got that set of matching leather luggage you promised her, if you get my drift.
He also publishes a newspaper that denies climate change.
Let it finish first! Some day people will give us credit for the pictures!
He's doing it for posterity.
It's just a phase he's going through.
First he got caught rewriting history. Now he's a featured speaker at a TED conference.
I think it is called an Artosaurus.
We club tagger!
When is that meteor coming?
Just some more extinction fake news...
"Art is what you can get away with" (A. Wahhol)
Good dinosaur art is so rare it seems to be getting extinct.
Compared to hers, our work is primitive.
I don't know, they seem a little primitive.
" I don't know art, but I know what I like to eat."  Submitted by Neil L. Sachs, Monmouth Junction, NJ
It won't work, there's no arc to the story.
It's a bit derivative, don't you think?
This is embarrassing!
Every picture tells a story, don’t it?
I wished I had used washable cave paint first.
Wait'll he discovers perspective!
He's been struggling a bit with his move toward realism.
No, don't club him -- my wife says the colors match the drapes.
It got a diversity scholarship.
With that diet, he's bucking for extinction.
He’s an early fauvist.
I'm just saying I'd feel safer knowing it was paint by numbers.
If that's the new menu at Dino's, then the Paleo diet now includes us.
Paint brushes don't kill people.
How derivative!
I told you that it wasn't me.
I'm really not that hungry. So I say we wait.
And I thought it's my wife always re-decorating when I'm on the hunt.
You distract him while I stamp it with my hand print and we’ll claim the work is mine.
Paintasaurus.
His art is very primitive.
We just gotta make it look like an asteroid did it.
It makes me nostalgic for his early Cretaceous period.
Why isn't that cultural appropriation as well?
He has a fairly unevolved style.
He's going to get all the credit.
Gives new meaning to creationism.
I'll be happy when Editorus Rex is extinct.
I think it's keeping score.
Nice, but worthless if not signed by the artist.
For the last time, do not teach our food to draw.
There he goes again. Showoff!
You realize, of course, we'll be the laughingstock of the Tree of Life if this gets out.
His style is primitive but popular.
I wish he'd be more of an "outsider" artist.
Ugh, he can never get my nose right
We assumed they'd evolve opposable thumbs eventually, but never saw this coming.
I told you. Ralph can't get past the Picassozoic Era.
Man, he's got a warped self-image.
He went to harvard
You order Netflix?
I'm so glad we decided on Montessori.
AHHHH! So THAT'S what dragon's eat. Well then, we're screwed.
He doesn't get realism is so last year.
You have to admit it Allen. While he really puts your handprint turkeys to shame, we have clubs. On three?
Are you into Art Dino?
I foresee problems from the perspective of the future historical record
I wish we had invented language to describe this.
You know, maybe there is something to this whole opposable thumb thing.
This is who we were looking for. See there, it’s Fred and Charlie on the wall.
Well, I'm none too pleased about the insulting caricatures of us.
I wanted something modern for this wall, but he's really hard to get.
You take the creature, I'll take the drawings.
Say What? In the gifted class?
This T-Rex kid is the interior decorator you hired for your man cave?
Meteor, Ice Age, I don't care - we just need to pick one and stick with it.
How many times do I have to tell you to keep Kenny in his crate. The neighbors will think our taste in art primitive.
Nah, that ain't Banksy.
He's keeping score, and it doesn't look good for us!
Let's call our copyright attorney.
You should see his glass-blowing skills!
He's not so special! Check out the three "moons".
I apologize for blaming you for writing on the wall.
Not another New Yorker dinosaur cartoon!
Ars gratia artis
Let it go Ourg, millennia from now, we’ll get all the credit!
It'll never sell. It's hard to get the perspective right without an opposable thumb.
Yeah, but he's got a tail. We'd just fall down.
Are Fred and Barney missing?
Just don't ever tell him, "My kid could do that..."
Just as I suspected!
They call them Salvador Dalisaurs.
The critics will hate it.
He thinks that he's illustrating a menu.
You clobber - I sign us name.
Mr. President. I thought we agreed, no more tweets.
This is the original-Chalk Talk
If this guy is extinct, we can take credit.
You said brilliant color and profound symbolism.
In their era, these dinosaurs may have seemed erudite, but their skills don’t hold a fiery stick to the brutal artistry of the troglodyte.
He has no sense of perspective
It's a petroglyphicus, you hominid!
Darn hooligans and their graffiti. That junk never washes out of the walls.
Let’s take him out to see the really bright new star
Oh, please. Representational art is so...Pleistocene.
Thanks for the reference Harry, hopefully he's a better tutor than the last one.
Me so sick of Paleo diet..
ITS THE MENU FOR THE DINO DINER
Take my wife, please.
I hear they have everything on the menu
He says he wants to leave a great legacy
The art contest was a great idea! He's forgotten he came here to eat us.
Talented? Yes, but they taste like dirty loincloth.
Art? Art.
He's already planning this week's menu.
Pre-modernism really sucks
I recommend the hot dog.
He vandalizes and we'll probably get blamed for it.
At least he's wall trained.
We are not progressing much, are we ?
Sure, being an artist is a great way to attract our women, but they can’t evolve together. All he can do is eat them.
Heh heh, you think he'd know there's no future in art.
Braggart.
A picture is worth a 1000 words!
Post-modernasaurus.
You have to admit, that is a good likeness of your brothers.
Good artists copy. Great artists steal.
Some pet you gave me! Third time this week she's ruined the walls! I'll have to get the stone mason in again.
Ya, it ate 'em all.
Another gimmick from a new gallery.
Yes. He wants to do City Hall, but funding ran out.
The drawings are rather pedestrian but he's the last of his breed using freehand.
I knew when he walked on two feet that he was talented.
How come we're out there ravaging while he gets all the cushy jobs?
I thought WE did that.
The graffiti is ruining the neighborhood.
Wow! I thought those tiny little arms were useless.
They really are the greatest generation
Ferocious? Ferocious in his *vision.*
I don’t mind primitive, but that looks nothing like Mom and Dad.
Looking ahead thousands of years from now, we'll get the credit.
He thinks it's his trophy room.
Roxie's favorite artist. Wilma said our walls were too boring.
Keeps him off the streets
This is where I draw the lines
They-re going to blame us Neanderthals for such lousy art work.
Aw Jeez, this Paleo cookbook is gonna take years to finish!
"Why did I let you drag me here, I hate 'early American", it's so primitive"!
The days when a couple of ordinary white guys can get ahead are over.
I just KNEW we'd evolve first
Don't mind his doodles, history will be written by the victors.
Huh. I thought Realism was extinct.
He certainly didn't get it from my side.
Do we really need another restaurant?
The cave painting is part of a ritual in which the artist, by sacralizing our images on the wall along with other prey animals, hopes to ensure that we will taste good.
When it leaves we can sign it and take credit. No one will believe dinosaurs can draw.
You club him on the tail. I'll club him on the head and we will take the credit.
Today's menu.
Let him finish then we'll kill him
"At least let him enjoy it until evolution".
Ssshh, don't disturb him. Eons later, modern Homo Sapiens will point to these pictures as evidence of our high culture.
I think wallpaper would have been the better choice
See, I told you- her kind of talent is extinct nowadays!
Too bad color hasn't been discovered yet.
Bro, he's definitely taking artistic license with YOUR face...
For something extinct, he sure has a vivid imagination.
All I can say is, it paints better than you do.
Who 'da thought he'd be right-handed?
Let's try elsewhere- I'm trying to cut down on refined foods.
Check out what Larry wrote on Tim's wall!
All that, plus tasty.
I only let him draw where no one will ever see it.
I just know we won't get blamed for this... He draws so much better with those little twigs than we can with our clubs.
You tell him that’s cultural appropriation.
That’s Michaelangelosaurs, married to my Aunt Sue.
There goes the resale value.
Says he can teach us a thing or two if we can stand on two feet and walk erect.
Wanna re-write pre-history?
I tried to housebreak him, but he still does it inside.
I don't know. Let's ask Plato.
He works only in charcoals.
Your art is another caveman's graffiti.
Should we report the graffiti?
Look at that awful composition and brushstroke technique. No wonder they went extinct.
He signs it PR for Picassosaurus Rex.
As you can see, we have expanded our menu. NOTE: The previous address and submission from Colleen Bush should have been this one. I forgot to enter the new caption. Thank you!
If we kill them all off, we can take credit.
They say artistic talent often skips a generation.
That’s the trouble with exposed rock.
There's the gang punk that's been putting graffiti on our walls.
I hope the landlord doesn't blame us for marking up the walls.
The Invention of Plagiarism
The picture of me looks fat.
Fuck! I told you we should have put a copyright on those drawings
This isn't what I thought would happen when we gave him a time-out.
Cleaning the walls isn't so hard after we switched him to water based-based paint.
This is a bad sign since history is written by the victors...
Very derivative, he'll never last.
It's his "I love me" wall.
Political cartoonists are a different breed.
Don't worry, they'll never attribute to an extinct species.
It's better than what he creates on the floor.
Wait till he finishes. Then we eat him and take the credit.
We will get blamed for that nonsense for eons.
They call that modern art
Sure, it's easy if you have a trust fund.
The law 'Do Not Club Artists' has been passed.
"He's such a moron, illustrates for the 'New Yorker' I hear.
I still say we should have hired a cutting edge decorator --as opposed to one stuck in old world traditions
A lizard? Gee, Grok, I always assumed Banksy would be a Mammoth.
Prehistoric ghostwriter
I'm worried future generations will think we weren't capable of Abstract Expressionism.
But is it to scale?
Show off!
That guy in the middle is a dead ringer for your cousin 'Emuk'
What's The Louvre?
I dunno, do you see anything you like?
I'm more of a fan of their Cretaceous period work
Her repertoire is limited but she works for less than minimum wage.
I say we hit him over the head and plagiarize his work!
These creatures seem rather evolved, huh Frank?
It's a tyrannadrawus.
I told you that Plagiasaurus is up to no good.
You hit him over the head; I'll take credit for his work.
Next term he's teaching us impressionism.
He thinks he's people.
Unfortunately, I think it's tonight's menu.
Lets wack him now before they invent copyright.
Sellout.
If I had wanted to decorate, I would have decorated!
Yep. Looks like we found our what happened to Oog and Boog, and their 2 horses
I told you it was a bad idea to get a Graffitisaurus!
The wife said she knew the best interior decorator, but I prefer more abstract art.
I hate figurative impressionism.
Trogg - not my idea give Picassosaurus coloring stick...
My wife asked him to decorate the place.
He's just showing off the Primitive style because he has a lizard brain.
I can't figure out what he means, but he certainly has a message.
Imagine how much it will be worth he's extinct.
At least, he is drawing these characters and not killing us.
They're just copies. Not really worth a visit.
Art has gone to the way of the dinosaur.
I don't care how cheap he works, I don't think conceptual art is getting us anywhere.
A dinosaur doing cave drawings looks pretty real to me, Plato!
I'll just redo the walls when I move in.
Primitive art, yes, but there is a strong religious undertone to this whole thing.
It is good therapy. He won't be so hungry.
Time to rescind his NEA grant and eat him.
First recorded case of fake news.
We just keep him for the fire.
We’re going to get blamed for this.
We better start evolving a bit quicker.
I wonder if studio space will always be this hard to get in NYC.
He’s going to submit the best one to the New Yorker for their caption contest.
I don't care how talented it is, I'm taking the credit.
Great! The Henderson's pet got out, again!
Let's whack him before he signs it. You know, say we did it!
I figured if I went with one the old masters whose work will stand the test of time it never needs redecorating.
No one can know about this!
Sticks and stones may fossilize my bones but cave art will never hurt me
I swear it's just my holiday weight
What is art?
Oh, Great! ......It took me forever to get the carbon deposits off the walls just last week!
Let him finish before we eat him.
Guess we need to move again.
Posed for him for three moons and it doesn't look a thing like me.
Personally, I prefer wallpaper.
I told you this cave was being hacked.
He may be a stylistic chimera, but his security deposit is real.
No, you go first!
Better he decided to paint today - rather than have us for lunch.
His use of negative space is rather predictable and timeworn.
He's making it up; fake news or artistic license, it's just not right.
His style may be primitive, but that color palette is far more sophisticated than yours.
Artists are so bizarre.
I'm telling you in thousands of years they will think we were just a bunch of animals!
Endearing or not, sentient meat is lower in harmful Omega-6 fatty acids. End of story.
They said he was Cave Trained.
He's our new interior decorator.
The value is sure to go up after he's extinct.
I think it is really derivative.
The Times critic loved his last show.
We'd better stop him before his scribbles ruin our cave.
If we could do that, maybe we could beat him.
Lascaux Louie is at it again.
How does he do it? He doesn't even have thumbs?
Ugh, Tyrranosaurus Banksy.
Now, we’re supposed to call him Picassoraptor!?!
If you won't do it to eradicate the species, do it so future historians give us credit for the art.
I don't know what's worse; the constant wall screeching or its primitive depictions of modern day society.
Don't stop him! People will think we did that.
Good story so far. No kill til done
Yes, but he provides nothing of the mise en scene!
He's hoping to win a MacArthur Genius Grant.
He calls it neolithic surrealism.
They say the Art Institute will take anybody.
My caption never gets selected!
I thought that minimalist style had died out.
I need a new editor.
Granted it's good, but he'll never make a living at it.
Damn Agar, you are so picky! Yes, it’s free range.
Looks exactly like you.
And we thought he was too Jurassic.
Shhh... they'll never know its Fake News
What do you mean "muse"?
This won't make our landlord happy!
Let's kill him and claim we did them.
Let's wait till it finishes, kill it, and claim we did it. We could get famous.
I am happy you picked this dinosaur to decorate our home. Very surprising that he turned out to be avant-garde interior designer.
Qu'en pensez-vous, monsieur Lascaux?
I prefer his use of Crayolas.
Do you think that's his diet journal for the week?
Let's kill him and say we did that.
He paints what he kills.
He was only chasing one bird!” “I tell ya, I saw just the two of ‘em.” “Not much of a crowd.” “It’s fake news.” “Yeah, what can you expect from a lizard?
It's a new place, "Club 21 Million BC."
Are you sure this is the new age art show? Looks prehistoric to me!
If we can destroy this ....no one will know they beat us to it
I can't believe it." "I know, I didn't think Gary was so good at drawing.
It's better than you.
Wonder what they'll be serving at the opening reception ?
Actually, it's a shopping list.
His work is overrated. It will never sell at the cave auction.
'Contemporary,' it's the latest craze.
Next year he's planning a field guide!
Thankfully, as with most of the artists in her species, she's a vegetarian.
why did you give him the crayons again?
I think we need thumbs, too.
1). Life imitates art or is it art imitates life? 2). That shoots down your Creationist Theory.
He's the kind of editor you just don't say no to.
First it was fire, now this. What's with this guy.
I think everyone would love to have your art teacher for dinner tonight.
I told you there was a reptilian conspiracy.
You use club, me sign 'Ugg'.
He's so bad. That doesn't look anything like me.
The value of the art work will increase if he’s dead.
So Ringo - you say you want an evolution.
There goes our wild-beast damage deposit.
He’s drawing a mural of his favorite foods.
The best meat's in the tail.
It'll be worth more when he's dead.
OMG! It's a project runway unconventional challenge!
Why do dinosaurs only paint what they want to eat?
Wait till you meet my wife's latest decorator !
I can't get him to work. All he wants to do is draw
He's a good decorator, but he wont be around long at those prices
Was he one of our finalists?
Primitive! No, postmodern! Primitive! No postmodern! Primitivism! No postmodernism!...
That is so against the CC&Rs.
Damn immigrants taking our jobs
Good thing someone knows what they're doing.
Honestly i'm surprised he's moved past his surrealism phase so quickly.
His technique's a little crude if you ask me
A graffitisaurus!
Where'd you find this muralist? He's a real dinosaur!
I told the wife I'd bring home something more interesting for dinner tonight.
Those darn graffiti artists are back
Fine Mr. Keane, after we kill him you can add larger eyes.
Ever since he discovered fire, he's been acting weird.
Big deal. His grammar is terrible.
he comes every day. we just decided to stop trying to make him stop.
I told you to lock away the crayons!!!
I was hoping for something a bit more post-modern expressionist.
See what happens when you don't put your paints away?
No wonder they are going extinct. Have you ever seen such a primitive motif?
Imagine how much they'll be worth when he's dead.
No sense of perspective. And his color sense is all wrong.
Doesn’t seem right to kill such a sensitive artist.
What a croc, I knew it was him.
He's just spreading fake history news.
It's so derivative.
He's the greatest artist of the Paleozoic Era, I'd die to get in his class.
Wait'll they die out: those drawings will be worth a fortune.
That's so, yesterday!
He is a food blogger
Caveweeks's latest edition - but you know it's all fake news.
So you'll find that the savviest and most alive collector's, eat the artist first.
I wish I had that kind of talent
the artistic ones taste best.
He wants us to think that he's extinct.
Call me a stick in the mud, but I'm not dining here again until they take old Harv off the specials menu.
These are primitive drawings that reek of reptilian, fear-based, hindbrain usage. Meh.
The weatherman says this will the last episode.
No one must know this...we have a reputation to create.
She's revising the stew recipe in her cookbook. A few ingredients have gone extinct.
Who let in the Giottonomous?
They’re evolving faster than us.
Do we handle this as a dominant species or as an evolved one?
If he saw things as they really are, he would cease to be an artist.
It's primitive yet insightful.
Look, you took her home...you said... you had had a lot of grog... you said... she wasn't going to start homemaking... you said...
Sure, but can she cook?
Do artists ever to do their best work just before they die?
Feel like paleo artisanal?
He might just be keeping score, but he draws a lot better than you do.
Should we ask him to stop?" "Nah, what harm could it do?
This must be a restaurant. He's putting the menu on the wall.
“Let’s put some pretty little horses...” “Look out Fred. It’s a Bobrossasaus
His work sells because of his menacing figurative-narrative matrix.
Who's this idiot trying to impress.
Shh...let him finish - we can take credit!
WE SHOULD POSE FOR HIM AND GO DOWN IN HISTORY.
Why cant this be a normal game of dungeons and dragons
Photographer. Next comes the fake news with it.
Aim at her thumb.
"Oh, no--thousands of years from now they're probably going to think that we drew it." [underscore "we"]
Do you think it would be inappropriate for me to ask my decorator out?
Oh! I thought you were coming next Tuesday!
It’s a bit abstract for my taste.
So, the right side of his brain works but can he talk?
“So you gave him the charcoal ... No I didn’t ... Yes you did ... No I swear I ...p
What do you expect from a lizard?
I thought we were the only ones evolving.
You can't wait for inspiration. You have to go after it with a club.
A million years from now those know it all archeologists are gonna get it all wrong!
His rates and online reviews were great, but honestly, it seems forced
Do you think he knows this is a rented property?
Everyone’s a critic. I thought he was supposed to be extinct!
You give a T-Rex a few magic markers and they think they are Picasso.
Really, are we going to let him out do us like that.
He's not really all that clever, no one is going to believe that pterodactyls and humans co-existed.
How can we tell if it's just the artist in him that's speaking?
Today we start extinction.
It'll be worth one's when he's extinct
I don't care what you say, it's a dying form of art.
His earlier works are more abstract.
He's drawing his menu.
That's the hack who draws the shittiest New Yorker cartoons. You know, the ones with the crazy noses.
Ugh, still derivative and two-dimensional.
I just hope WE don't get blamed for this.
I think the British Museum would be interested. Let’s hit him over the head
That was before Mildred made me cut my hair.
Art? Our pet sneezes on the wall and the wife calls it stucco.
Your precocious new pet is now messing up my man-cave!
He doesn't look extinct to me.
Of course it stinks! But history will blame us.
He foolishly feels future generations will discover and value his drawings as well as his ancestors' remains.
It looks like wallpaper is making a comeback.
Ugh, he's always so meta.
This will prove to be very contemporary art...
If those art historians from 2020 could only see what we're seeing now!
Yeah? Well he sucks at sports
Too bad he won’t be around to enjoy it.
How many times do I have to tell you, not to leave the charcoal lying around?
See, good taste.
I sat in on her seminar last week. You're looking at the future...
I'm taking all artistic credit after he's extinct.
Yeah, right. That's Banksy.
Seen one neo-retro primitive artist, seen 'em all.
He really doesn't understand the concept of a "food chain".
This my new man cave.
If you ask me, he needs to find a new genre.
Are none of our human abilities sacred anymore?
Don't kill her yet. She's close to figuring out the fire thing.
I'll knock it out and hid the body. You grab his brushes and call the press!
Don't worry, they will give us credit.
They say cave art is going extinct.
She subleased it. On weekends it’s a hunters and gatherers market
I guess, it's ok for the hallway, but for the cold room he should paint a still-life.
Would you buy a painting from a dinosaur?
Who cares if he’s won the talent show three years in a row? He's got nothing on you! Your new act is FIRE!
He calls it ‘Prehistoric Futurism’.
We drafted him first round as a tight end but his real appetite is for menu art
I'm going to go invent the snitty art review.
Clever girl!
He's drawing us wearing pantyhose again. We need to do something about it.
Social commentary: this is the sort of work *you* should be doing.
He wants to be a graphic designer.
Let's start a new tradition called plagiarism...
Guess he’s moved on from those paleolithographs.
Why wait? Such work is much more desirable once the artist's dead.
I wanted to kennel him, but Mrs. Chauvet wouldn't have it.
It's his 'Food Pyramid'. He thinks he's on top of the food chain.
He better not insult us in the caption.
He's alright but he's no Banksy!
This is "fake news" believe me. Sad!
In the future he’ll be gone. And we’ll have oil paints.
Sacre bleu! It's a Basquiatosaurus.
The only thing extinct about him is his sense of perspective.
Ever since I took him for pet training he's been insufferable.
A bit derivative for my taste.
I’m having him decorate my cave next.
You said you just wanted a fixer upper that needed some paint.
He's about to enter his Clubist period.
I think I prefer Neoclassicism
Picasso-sauras is at it again.
You should see who.... I mean what his paints are made of.
Do you want one picture together or two separate ones?
Unfortunately, he's including us on today's menu.
This is therapy for his carpal dragon syndrome.
OMG... more Fake News!
Just make sure he's done before my show opens.
A thousand years from now someone's going to look at these and think we're stupid.
And for dessert...
He wants the cave for his gallery.
How derivative!
A more primitive creature called a lawyer said he can't draw our likeness without us signing a release
I think we found LeonardoDaVincicus!
It's called Cave Graffiti, Arnold, and it's the latest craze
His work is derivative, let eat 'em.
Don't fall for it, lizard tastes like chicken.
Prehistoric art is so off the wall!
I told you not to rent the cave out to an artist.
Which one of us will take credit for this?
You realize, all this gentrification means us hard-working tax payers can't afford to own any of these caves.
He's selecting his last supper.
Usurper!
Let's kill it and take credit for all humanity.
Great, that mutt graffiti's all over the walls, but I’ll get blamed for it.
We’ll club him after he’s done shading.
I told you to keep him in the crate.
You distract him, I'll grab the crayons!
He calls himself "Banksy."
Sure, it's good, but I find his work derivative.
Yeah, well, I'd be happy to compare SATs with the smug bastard.
Didn't I say one asteroid wasn't enough to get the job done?
You art what you eat
Please tell me you registered the copyright.
I call him Salvador Dino.
He's only an apprentice. I'm claiming the copyright.
Think we should try this?
We're be all right, as long as he forgets to sign it.
His art is so Cretaceous
Hmmm, looks like we're at an evolutionary crossroads: We better kill Him before he kills more of Us.
Yeah, he's good alright. You go for the legs, I'll take the head. Then we'll drag the girls back here and take credit for his work.
He ruined our cave. Now no one will ever want to come here.
25,000 years from now who'll know it's all plagiarism? My style and charcoal sticks!
If you see a drawing of me up there, please tell my wife to cash in the life insurance policy.
You club him, and then I'll leave him out of the cited sources.
Welcome to Jurassic Art.
He's my grad student. I'm taking credit for it.
Honestly? It's an interesting thought, but not really our kind of thing, is it? Aren't we more about--well, killing things?
It's this new idea of animal rhetoric.
You're right, let him be, aesthetics isn't everything.
It's a new species. Picasso-saurus-rex.
When he starts drawing human sacrifices, I'm out of here.
Should we eat him or raise his rent?
Me not know, but heard new art director hiring "millenials."
I’ll never go back to wallpaper.
Consider him nouvelle cuisine with an artistic flair...
Like I said, another Basquiat meets Klee rip-off artist
He's calling the series "post-historic"
It's good, he can the high walls and ceiling.
It's the world's first fake news.
I hate editors.
I wanted pastels, but he prefers charcol.
Yep, you're dying.
It would be interesting to hear what they'll make of that a few thousand years from now.
I think we can do better.
If they don't learn to specialize, they won't survive.
I think he's very good considering his early age.
How Ancestry.com began
It’s early onset autism.
Let' get a beer; we will take credit for it later.
My wife wanted to freshen up the man cave.
He says he's protected by copyright.
He better hurry up - the exhibition opens at 2.
How we play this is really important.
Hey, I think it would be a shame to kill Rex when he's just beginning to find his 'inner self.'
Damn! Too late! He stole our idea!
Let Puff have at it, I say. I mean, he's having a good time - and some day you and I will get credit for creating a whole new art form!
Hard to believe that we discovered fire before they did.
The guy wins the contest but loses his life.
I guess that makes us the missing link.
Do you think it does tattoos?
I hear he 's also working on this new round device.
Not bad. If she can cool, I'll consider it
He wants to make his mark in history!
That's no bird!
...the good news is, Dino is just about done printing tonight's menu...
I thought the decorator was starting tomorrow?
Every time he eats one he draws one.
Let's welcome him to the club.
With all those lessons he's never improved an iota!
We'll probably get credit for this, and let the future anthropologists write what they may.
We'll kill him after he finishes the bedroom.
We'll worry about moving it later.
He started off with stick figures. But then he ate Pablo.
OF THE 3 DRAGONS ON GAME OF THRONES, HE'S THE MOST ARTISTIC!
That drawing makes me look fat.
They’re revenge petroglyphs. He saw the dinosaur footprints I etched in the mud.
It's post-extinctism - not everybody's cup of tea.
Uh oh. Baby found the crayons .
My dog could do better.
....and now, to a more civilized time.
Why do the prior owners always have lousy taste?
I love it when galleries provide food.
It was “graffiti” last year. This year it’s “creative place making.”
She is the last of her kind. Let's kill her, and then we can claim it for us.
How's my hair?
When he's done, let's chase him off and we'll sign it.
See? this is why I hate fake news!
Man, if I had half a brain...”
I guess the writing’s on the wall, but how did Donald Jr and Eric get here?
You can go next.
"He got his DNA test done last week. He hasn't been the same since he learned he's got 30% pterodactyl in his genes".
I hope he doesn't sign it
Quiet; he doesn't know he has the brain the size of a pebble.
I say we kill him, open a gallery, and take all the credit.
I told you all the galleries are dominated by dinosaurs.
He's depicting natures symbiotic relationship with man." "He signs his paintings Dino Da Vinci
You should see the flaming ball of death he drew at Zog's house.
If DNA become available, me challenge paternity.
Looks like someone's an evolutionary social climber!
He'll never be popular in a million years!
He sold my wife on it.
We may be on the menu, but at least we're not the hors d'oeuvres .
'I thought you said your ex stinked.. from here she looks quite talented '
Oh, so this that Banksy character!
I have a feeling that we're witnessing the beginning of a conspiracy theory.
Reptiles....who's going to look at those anytime soon?
The caricature adds twenty pounds.
I say we take away his charcoal.
There's a good chance we'll score some royalties.
Ughh. I specifically told him we wanted wall paper.
I tried painting with him, but he bit off my ear.
He's not an artist -- that's his kill journal!
I can't wait till they're extinct. We'll get all the credit.
Wife say get eaten alive just price me have to pay for good decorator.
I miss the chisel medium.
Derivative.
He says the perma marker will make his drawings last longer.
No, no, that's definitely surrealist.
Does he EVER have a story to tell!!

He must be a sketchasaurus

I'm not sure exactly this 'art' thing is, but I think we should put a stop to it.

His work's been featured in the New Yorker.
Sure that's him Officer Mullaney?
He's implying we have to pay the rent.
Is crazy? Me not surprised...brain in tail.
I just love his use of light!
Leave him alone for now- he’ll get angry if we interrupt his flow
I wish he'd do his writing in his own office.
Uh-oh. It's the food critic for the La Brea Tar Pits Times.
Another handyman? I hope you checked references this time.
He thinks he is menu planing
And yellow hair to boot.I guess the writing is on the wall !
Yeah, he's cool, but I'd rather have the clubs.
Looks like he is an artistic type
You call it art, I call it cultural appropriation
I like it. Let's wait until she finishes. Then we'll kill her.
Who hired Michael Dragonglo to paint the walls and ceiling?
You gonna tell him his time’s up?
Don't worry, they'll be long gone when our progeny will discover the art!
We'll register the copyright and claim authorship. Nobody will believe him!
Do I look fat?
This helps OUR hunt, right?
Teachers Pet.
I told you it was all fake news!
The wife's been nagging me to hang some pictures." "Let him finish and then will club him.
So much for the concept of evolution.
Give that thing opposable thumbs and it goes from good to brilliant, no?
Not bad, but it's large scale work is much better.
He's almost too prolific.
Let's make him a deal -- draw us or die.
That’s odd... I think it says “Nina”.
He studied at the Art Students League.
Who's going to believe this? Like, one woolly mammoth.
And I say being the last of his kind is a good thing.
You first. Just praise his tromp l'oeil.
Johnson is good, but I know a way we can take credit.
That's the idea. Draw what you had for lunch.
Clearly head and shoulders above his contemporaries.
He's composing the menu for his new restaurant.
His work is too primitive and just as he is, passé.
Why is the lizard vandalizing our property?
Don’t say anything to suggest Impressionism. He thinks it’s photorealism.
He hasnt got a patent. They may as well be ours.
If we kill all of them, no one will ever imagine.
It’s either a lovely mural, an awful battle strategy, or an excellent plan for Sunday night football.
Well, I say it's puerile and derivative and I say we bash his head in.
Yes, we have to arrest him. Remember the "Broken Windows" theory.
When he finishes, let's eat him!
It already has an agent.
We should try this someday.
What kind of creature puts a menu on the wall?
Terrible artist.
I guess we’re not at the top of the food chain any more.
Well so much for that far fetched "opposing thumb" theory supposedly giving us a leg up.
Holly hired him to do our place.
I know how to bat the artist, but I don't see how we steal his art work.
Those must be his victims.
I’m a fan of his earlier work.
One year of art school and he thinks he's the next famous graffiti artist.
If that's us, he either asks for money or he's very confident.
I thought you said he was the best interior decorator stone tools could buy.
I'm sorry about the others but we have to eat.
Wait, Al, I think we're seeing the prototype of the first i-phone.
I admit he’s got talent, but he covered up my nuanced painting of smoke.
'Me amazed. Me always thought he was a lefty.'
Yeah, but it's so primitive!
Wow a rare Grafitisaurus Anachronismus !!
I pay him by the hour
I know, sir. There are so many tasty choices.
Not so smart! Has he figured out they are our decorative artwork!
His generation calls it tagging.....I don't think it's a good outlet.
I can't read Tyrannosaurus, but I'm sure it's not flattering.
I can't think up a caption for this one, can you?
So what? It's paint by numbers.
Are we related to that?
Only we know who the real cave artists were.
And they call us cave dwellers?
NO ONE violates the lease on my watch. Let's do it, Jimmy.
He's starting to get on my nerves.
Let him finish. Then we'll open our own gallery.
The landlord will blame us.
How does he blend his colors so well?!
I have to say, he's leaving a fact-based imprint of our culture.
She's a Modernist.
Let him go. We'll end up getting the credit.
First caveman: "What the hell is that?" Second caveman: "I'm not sure, but whatever it is, it's probably millions of years out of place."
This is our cave. You go tell him
I liked his early work better. Seriously...Do I look that hairy to you?
I prefer mastodon sculpture.
This guy will be considered a genius in 1000 years.
Trust me! We Stem -- and never these Meek -- will inherit the Earth.
Wow! He is such a great artist, we should get him some recognition!
We always know we're going to eat with Coach Rex drawing up plays for the game.
If you like this then you should really check out his Tumblr
He's become too predictable...I'm gonna club 'im.
The first instance of plagiarism.
I hope this art results in some true self-reflection.
I told you they could attract an Editosaurus...
Let's kill him.
Don't worry, he'll be extinct soon, so we will get the credit after all.
So, that's how they managed to get the pictures on the ceiling!
I don't like the paintings of man being eaten.
Now's your big chance to become a prehistoric art critic.
You wouldn't believe what people will pay for this stupid representational art.
It's his way of giving posterity some clues to his existence.
One of those dinosaurs from the 60's and 70's. Let's get him before he breeds.
It's a dino-drawer!
Looks like more of that news we keep seeing.
He's just wasting his time. He should be out hunting those meals.
Another example of "Fake News". Me am Sad.
I say we club 'em extinct and take the credit.
He’s a genius-NOT dinner..
I don't like his style!
Do you have any idea the arguments this will cause 10,000 years from now?
His spatial contextualizing adds to a playful paradox simplicity that is hard to put your finger on, don’t you agree?
Maybe just a bad review...
I ain't never seen a 'den of iniquity' before!
Amateur!
Hanna-Barbera, he ain't.
I don't care if it is your foyer, you can't club Fangsy!
His work expresses a Pre-Industrial sensibility.
He beat us to it again!
Hey! I saw her first.
He is generating the menu list for the new restaurant he is about to open.
I say we knock him off now, before he blames this extinction stuff on us!
I'm just not a fan of modern art.
She should really explore her identity though.
Wait til he's finished decorating, then the cave and the artwork is ours!
It's my art teacher working on next weeks menu.
cave creature evolution
do you think History will judge us kindly for inventing the 'Outsourcing'....
Choice is model or meal?
Quite a primitivist, if you ask me.
All I wanted was somebody to tidy up around the place.
When he leaves, put your name on it. People will think it was us.
She's not much to look at but her knuckles are incredibly smooth.
It's warm, dry, and well lighted. All it lacks is a man's touch.
I told you it was time to get him neutered.
I was hoping Pest Control would do the trick.
Rex is getting a jump on his Thanksgiving menu.
My wife hired him to redo the entry. She really likes his work.
Years from now they'll think we did this.
I told you we took too long to develop
The worst part is, WE'LL get the blame for it!
Did you hear? He's the Lizard King, he can do anything!
And he told his mother he was going to STOP tagging.
Maybe too smart for his own good.
It's that damn graffiti dragon. Should I order him to drop his brushes, or just club him?
Yes, but his color palette is sublime!
He draws better than you!
To be candid, it makes me feel quite objectified. BLORG SMASH!
His sense of scale is impeccable.
Is this Drawing Class 101?
He says this one will really mess with the minds of our descendants.
Clubbing him now just seems like a waste.
Hand me a big chunk of that asteroid, will ya?
Supposedly he's the best portrait guy in village.
...on Craig's list, under hieroglyphics
Has your wife been doing pilates?
It’s our vision of a step beyond the walk in freezer.
Copyright infringement justifies capital punishment!
Uh oh ... looks like he has us on his prey wall.
I say Extinct Revival is passé.
It's all about them.
If we don't crack down on this, robberies and murders will sky rocket.
Ok, He is an art dealer will let him go.
... and she’s inexpensive. Just don’t tell her that her work is primitive!
Have you met my new studio assistant?
It's a temporary exhibit.
And there I was complimenting you on your fine painting technique.
I knew those short arms were being used somewhere.
An amuse-l'oeil, compliments of the chef.
Jathinkhesaurus
I say the hell with that - we're the dominant species, and they can damn well quit buggerin' up my walls.
He thinks cursive is stupid
Today's lunch specials.
All he wants is the trademark and a vegan lunch.
My kid could do better than that.
The Painted Lizard has a remarkable palette of colors from which is uses in its cave drawings.
I know, but it’s got him out a terrible depression.
Who said it's called graffiti?
One day he'll be president.
Him unevolved. No understand chiaroscuro.
I say it's a new species: Let's call it Dino De Laurentiis.
Really? Another painting of a hunt? I just think he's the last of a dying breed.
His wall menu is impressive—a well balanced diet.
I thought he was left-handed
Yes, he is writing the Women's Healthcare Bill.
I heard he majored in Contemporary Art.
It's an Opposablethumbasaurus.
Look who got opposable thumbs
And they save we are primative
Don’t worry, the asteroid, will change history
Look! See? Evolution was fabricated by the dinosaurs.
No wonder, in these pictures, the dinosaurs always win!
Great idea! Let's go back to our cave and put pictures on the walls! Without the people.
What did she mean when she said she's drawing plans for a Christian theme park?
No way will that joker get the credit, pal. Don't worry about it.
History in the eyes of a savage
No, no. First, he finish with his Muse. THEN, we bash him on the head.
I told him I thought landscapes would sell better.
I'm shocked he has opposable thumbs.
I won't tell if you won't tell!
I have one of those on my wall at home
I know he's your favorite, but all this will triple in value when he's gone
Plagiarism, I tell you, plagiarism!
You don’t say, he has two legs from the hips to the ground, and his abode contains caricature decor on the low down.
After he finishes the foyer Jennifer wants him to do the dining cave.
I don't know about you, but I'm not going to miss them.
I told you that Paintasaurus wouldn’t know when to stop.
Don't worry. History will be written by the evolutionary victors.
"Daenerys, those fire insurance adjusters are here again".
His favorite foods!
He's didn't really capture my personality.
We all need perspective.
in the future there will be a device...
It's www.Ecave.Dinosoar.1BC for the best downloadable images.
Primitive creatures, still in their post-Impressionism phase.
Don’t worry in the other cave they predict an extinction event...
At least they included us this time.
'If you complain about the renovations again, he will bite your head off!'
This is the first time I've caught her in the act of making a mess.
There goes our Paleolithic history.
‘Behold the famous artist-brother of T. Rex — T. RENOIR!’
You distract her while I check tonight's specials.
Family portrait
That kind of brushwork will soon be extinct.
Just had to send my DNA to Antecedents.com.
Oh great! Another Picasso.
I think he's making fun of us and our way of life. We should hire him for weekend fun nights.
Picasso has nothing on this guy.
He's hot now but wait 'til everyone tires of "still life" and suddenly he won't be the darling of the cave scene.
Let's get out of here quick before we get blamed for it!
Now that he found your paintbrushes, he will never play 'hide and seek' with us again.
Derivative, certainly, but I admire her narrative intentions.
Ogg club, Grogg take credit.
Oh how the tables have turned
I told you lizard brains were left-brain types!
This creature is creating emojis but they will never catch on.
Filth. All he does are nudes.
Look like fake news. Zog sad.
I told you to get her some colors.
I can't attack an artist while he's working
I told him not to draw on the walls!
I'll bet anything we get blamed for this!
When sis they get opposable thumbs?
Dino Picasso - the artist of Jurrasic age
Well there goes that theory.
So, Grugg...how that “asteroid” coming along?
Not the symmetry I wanted, but the style is rock solid.
What are we, chopped liver?
This is a perfect time of a truly no no story.
Pfft. Fake news.
We are indeed inside a simulation.
He has to go. He’s eating us out of house and home
If only they knew Adobe Suite.
Club him now, before he gets our long-drawn-out history.
Yes, it's still my art! You don't expect an architect to build his own cave, do you?
Have you decided on a drink?
Wait! My one man show is coming up and I haven't done anything for it yet
The fake news from the mammal-stream media is disgusting!
He'll be inventing the wheel next.
You see that charcoal he's using to draw? That used to be Bob so let's get outta here.
rex´s work is so derivative
They're going places, man. Offer to be their agent.
But when I write on the walls it's "Oog, don't smear feces on the walls." Figures.
Looks like the rent is going up.
Don't worry; no one will believe this fake news.
Another Gloryhogsaurus.
I have a feeling this new designer is going to cost me a fortune to finish out the foyer.
What's a Banksy?
It's irrelevant that you find it artistically compelling. Graffiti is always vandalism!
I told you evolution was an invalid theory!
Are we St. Georges or Indiana Joneses?
Henri Rousaurus...nice guy but I find his work rather primative.
For the first time in history, Morty, we’ll have to declare creativity a public nuisance.
He just doesn't see us as a dynamic, integral part of his world.
And you thought their small arms served no purpose.
Uh-oh, I think he's making the menu pictures, and plans to turn our hole into the drive-through window.
I hired him to paint the walls and ceiling. Calls himself Michelangelo. Now he's trying to turn a plain and simple job into a masterpiece.
I'm telling you it's the three moon's cafe, and that's the menu!
I hate when he makes us look like Cousin Itt.
Should we tell him horses and birds can't swim?
I told you there's a forger around here.
Remember, if anyone sees us do it we just tell them we are "art critics".
See what happens,you give him a couple of books,a marker and bingo you got graffiti.
Do cartoonists have existential crises?
I bet he ate some of those weird mushrooms.
He says it relaxes him
She has gotten really sharp and a big mouth as she has developed a taste for other artists.
I was told they became extinct some fifty odd million years ago.
Nancy got him some graphite sticks for his Birthday, he hasn't stopped since.
Of COURSE hunting and gathering includes intellectual property.
You told me it had great taste. Really Carl!!
If we bonk him and sign our names like we did over the hill in Lascaux, then we'll get the credit again.
She may be an oddball, but her work is cutting-edge.
It's rather derivative, wouldn't you agree?
We are all old here guys.
He has no idea he's just a flash in the pan.
I was already feeling a little slow.
People are going to think we drew those.
He promised to give me lessons.
Anyone can draw. Technique is what separates the true artists from the rest of us.
My wife insisted on a classic but not quite extinct artist for our wall mural.
I sure hope that they stay around for awhile - yeah they tell our story so well - let's look for something else to eat today.
If we get rid of him, history will credit the paintings to us.
The place was looking dull. Artesaurus Interiors. I'd highly recommend them.
Not realistic!
You send him to your friends to let them know what you did today in 15 characters or less.
We were playing Fetch but Fido got tired of throwing the stick.
He'said got a future!
Let's get her while she's in the zone!
Wow, Grog! This reptilian make your cave penis paintings look like mammoth dung.
Still hasn’t gotten the self portrait correct
The maitre d' mentioned that monsieur has a big appetite today!
You know what they say, Frank. The cave drawings will be worth more after he's been clubbed to death.
Nobody will believe it - he's about to go extinct.
He's too much of a narcissist to give us an autograph.
Ever wonder where he gets his ideas?
He's good, but his esoteric story-line will fade in time
His work is too parochial for my taste.
He's my Salieri.
My 200 billionth granddaughter will be so pissed if she finds out I didn’t do these drawings.
So Devo was right?
They're serving the pterodactyl today. Try it before it goes extinct.
Did you bring the BBQ sauce?
And he's not even right handed.
I'm more worried about his bill.
I just want him to finish it before he gives extinct.
Those monsters from Sienna don't know anything about perspective.
Next thing you know, he'll be painting those on his body.
It’s a done deal. Once the “meteor” comes, the value will increase exponentially.
I say leave him alone. Posterity will think we did them.
They're not up to the showing he had in that gallery in Lascaux.
Things are still getting set up.
They've gotta go!
Isn't it a bit modern?
It says, "This cave is just right."
They really are in the last place you look.
Do you think I can get him to decorate my cave too?
I told you to get a haircut first.
These drawings are worthless! Why can't the Picassoraptor pay his bill like a regular customer?
Now do you believe me? This dinosaur is your thief - and he's plagiarizing too!
Nostradamosaurus anticipates the future
And I thought he was extinct.
And I thought we were the first ones with opposable thumbs...
Extinction is the only answer. Otherwise there’ll be a gazillion cave drawings showing us as lesser beings.
Ugg, reptilian brains have such a penchant for fake news!
Its way cheaper than hiring an interior decorator!
Guess we're not eating those mushrooms again.
The dinosaur whisperer is a genius.
At least now we know who's been drawing horses peeing on us. BBQ Deinonychus or tartar?
We'll wear green.....he's not a vegetarian.
An Artist-o-saurus?!!
DNA sequencing and animal behavioural studies have come along leaps and bounds, but until we get to grips with genitacally modified food production we're out in the cold!
Do you think we should we mention to him that there's an App for that?
The writings on the wall. He’s gone mad!
He wants to take all the credit
To hell with evolution! I say that last graffitisaurus is our dinner!
It's all false news. That's how he gets elected !
He's having a show soon.
Well, that explains the time machine parked out back.
I hope these dinosaurs are enjoying themselves, the meteor is on its way.
His name is really Picasso?
He's so TMZ
You'd think even a lizard could draw better than that!
Looks like we're on the menu.
He's really not that good - the pictures of you and me look nothing like us.
It's our 15 minutes!
She's not only a loving pet, but a good artist!
That damn Darwin is going to be insufferable.
I can't wait for these Michaelangelos to go extinct.
He went to Pre-K.
I wonder if he copyrighted it?
He's my best student.
Where does he think he is "Lascaux?
Because of his weight, he’s keeping track of his diet.
He’s writing episode 1, season 2 of his hit series DWELLER. Last season’s ending was a real cliffhanger!
Like I said, Gronk, figurative art is for dinosaurs.
I double-mammoth dare you to poke it.
Look, YOU ask him for lessons. Mine are just fine.
I've got an idea--let's call it Fake News.
Weren't they supposed to die off well before we came on to the scene?
Larry comes face to face with his alter in the parallel universe in next week’s episode of Fringe: Paleolithic.
I never should have given him that first charcoal.
Do you think he's going to watch to see if we erase it?
He does great detail work.
It was much bigger in real life.
These filthy dragons better get off my lawn. I'll call the cops!
One more trophy. Its’ been a good year for me.
Let's hope his artistic talent is detrimental to his ferocity.
Looks like Fred's preparing today's menu.
I told him to do a whole bunch, then I'm gonna open my cave and have a reception
I can honestly say I don't know what to say!
Would you prefer a kid's menu?
Wait till you see his stuff. It's hysterical.
Pate de foie artiste is to die for!
One look at that dreck and we’ll be forever labeled as primitive.
Thank god! No drawings of us roasting over a campfire pit.
Think of it as Jurassic Ark.
oh fuck
(((dinosaurs)))
Next thing you know, mammoths will be painting with their trunks.
He's always expressed himself best with charcoal.
Yeah, but he got my fat side.
And that's how they became extinct
OK - That is the last time your Dalisaurus gets left in My cave.
He says he wants to achieve immortality through his work.
First time I’ve had tunnel vision.
Now I know who hacked my account.
Another idiot who has been signed by the Food Channel!
He calls it "abstract expressionism." I call it "graffiti.
Hey Matt, is that the new interior decorator?
I hate to interrupt his artistic mojo, but I'm really hungry!
If we knock him off, we'll own his complete works.
What I'm suggesting is appropriation, not plagiarism.
Well, that blows your "fish gotta swim" theory all to hell.
I could see it in Rocky's room.
I wonder if he can cook.
Nice. He's got us at the bottom.
I think he's creating tonight's specials.
I hate it when they gang tag the cave!
You call THAT art?
Ok, we are agreed: we knock him over the head and tell everyone we did them
Darwinsaur
He could use an agent.
I think we're the surf 'n' turf this evening
The vandalism in this neighborhood is getting out of hand
Dino-mite!
The opening may be vegetarian for them, but not for us.
MY recipe for BBQ.
And here, I would just add a touch of sunset red.
It'd perfect -- he works on spec, we get the credit.
He's not a starving artist anymore.
Let him finish, then we can have him for dinner
Let’s spare clubbing him if he recognizes us as the next generation.
Best interior designer in the village!
Personally, I prefer modern art.
Primitivism is not my thing; I'm really more of a Modernist.
I'm not comfortable with drubbing that kind of talent.
Dinosaur BBQ’s specials look delicious today.  I had the wilder beast last week and it was a little tough.
Let's club the lizard to death just for being sensitive.
You'll see, by this time next year, this design will be out of date.
His Imaginary Animals
remember, a full frontal will cost him double.
Repetition - the crutch of today's artists.
Thinks he's pre-hysterical doesn't he?
He's recording his kills, he can't put notches in his club.
I never knew Fido had a creative streak!?
He's good, but the critics roast him.
I told him, people on top, creatures on the bottom!
Dude, that's not Banksy. It's the Mr. Brainwash guy from the movie.
So I'm extinct am I. I'll show them.
NO .. we wait till he finishes the kid's section.
I thought you said lizard brains sensed danger. We need bigger clubs.
Are you still watching "Fuller Cave" or can I stop drawing?
At least her drawing is better than her French.
So much for the pre-paleosaurus era.
His work may last through the ages, but I guarantee he won't.
What a creative idea! Men's we should try that.
Don't throw shade on his drawings.
Humans and dinosaurs never coexisted in the first place!
I told him I'd let him ghost write the first edition.
Amazing! And he never went to Art School!
It doesn't look a think like me
And they'll want supper.
"How dare the beast! He doesn't even have an opposable thumb!"mrs
He refuses to believe he's extinct and that its all over, so he's writing his version of 'What Happened'.
I told you the 7:30 show is never at good as the 10:30.
I guess he's been too busy to check Facebook -- he missed the invitation to the extinction event.
We are going to have to speak to him about drawing on the wall in paint.
They call him the Rembrandt of the missing links.
It’s intended for the Creation Museum.
We are early man. They still decorate for party.
Damn, once Gloria taught him how to paint, he won't hunt with me.
I question his credentials for teaching evolution.
If he used a little shading, he'd give his drawings some depth.
Darn! Now we'll have to paint again.
Isn't he supposed to be extinct?
He's already working on his legacy.
You will forever be known through history as the world's first art fraud!
He wants to be sure there is a record of all the species that he thinks are headed for extinction.
That's art? Are you kidding me? My 5-year-old paints better!
It's very derivative of Modern Cave Drawing.
I prefer his still lifes over his portraits.
Let's kill him and take credit for his work.
When my agent said it was a dinosaur film, I was picturing something more like Godzilla.
I hear he's the best portrait artist around.
This could change all of history as we know it!
Banksy?
We should stay home tonight, look at that last special, Caveman with a side of Pterodactyl
It's only an Egosauraus
I am not getting my deposit back!
I'm waiting 'til he gets through his yak period.
It's the only way we can stop him from publishing more Fake News!
We’ll leave him alone. It’s Flinestone’s pet, Dino.
It's the same old tired story from the Year One.
I think we took a wrong turn in that evolution thing.
You have a big decision to make
I’d say let him go. It will make us look good to archaeologists in a few thousand years.
If we ask nicely, do you think he'll draw us?
Just give him a chance.
I'm telling you, with a little practice, I think his work could be in museums.
Me really look that fat?
Zorg in post-asteroid realism phase... called "Futility of Evolution"
You're right. painting the house is an easy, inexpensive way to breathe fresh life into our home. Then we kill him.
He's commissioned by the Rex family.
How long will we have the Age of the Lizard?
Teenagers!!
Not surprising since he is a carvenivore.
The only way to claim credit is to kill them all and make it look like an accident.
Perhaps we need to rethink this.
He likes to create negative images of his enemies.
We have an agreement.
It's meta.
When we invent spray paint, move up to railroad cars.
There goes the neighborhood...
His art is the same as his future: It stinks.
Looks like he's documenting his favorite foods.
It started with Bob Ross on PBS.
Damn Frog Lizard.
He'll never go to college.
Another intruder. We should build a meteor and make the dinosaurs pay for it.
I can't bear to tell him they're retiring Dandelion.
He has a varied diet covering all the food groups.
It is amazing what the Dino saw.
He doesn't heel worth a damn.
At least he's a martyr for his art.
He's way too pre-modern for me.
This is the last straw--we've gotta round up another asteroid.
His comments are always 140 glyphs or less.
And I say the hooves are not revelatory, but minimalist.
I told you we shouldn't have gotten a Groupon.
Looks like we're dragon the chain.
You should see him draw to 'scale'
Wow! Those old guys are just like us.
He's got no eye for perspective, but at least his arms reach the wall.
I don't know, Bob! He says that's the way they dress at art school.
I think we're about due for an extinction-level event.
Hmmm... this must be the LEONARDO DINO VINCI genus I suppose.
This has to be the dumbest final request yet...
His dinoarchal narrative seems dated.
Well, now we know what happened to Oop and Grog!
We're golden here.... those plein air types are a waste of our time.
If he draws a picture of Barney I'm gonna thump him good.
We wanted Picasso, but he's on his honeymoon.
Hey, I know. Once he get's extinct, we'll tell everybody we did the drawings.
We better watch out, we're on his grocery list.
We'll probably get blamed for his childish two-dimensional stuff.
Don't ask me. I don't know.
He's good but he's no Matisse.
The interpretations will not be accurate...
Hey Ralph, who hired the graffiti artist?
Understand that it’s water colors are exquisite too!
How's he do that?
I thought I'd get to do the drawings but I guess 'Creation Museum' doesn't mean what I thought it did.
I just knew that Dino was a right-brain thinker.
no, those are the different things he has killed....he's considered an Ace
Personally, I favor wallpaper. But Girl insist on stenciling.
I don't care if he is the last of his kind, I say we club him. I hate a show off.
Tell me, can Neanderthals really appreciate such great art?
Let's get him an easel and canvas. We'll make a fortune.
I'm telling you, that's where he cut off his ear.
That's what you get for "dragon" him to all those art classes !
I hope nobody ever thinks I'm the one that did that.
Sure, he nails you, but I look do look like that!
Wait what? Humans aren't the only form of intelligent life?!
Way more durable than canvas.
I dino if I like this new wall art.
I hope it's not thinking about adding us to the wall.
His earlier work is much more primitive.
I wonder if years from now mankind will realize what happened
I keep telling him that tweating is going to lead to something not good."
You know this isn't going to look good in the history books.
He's obviously on the wrong side of history...
He's the subject of the book, 'Portrait of the Artist as a Young Reptile.'
Sure, it's an unflattering portrait of you, but there's something raw yet accessible about it....
His resume says he has "ages" of experience.
Have you seen the mastodon art? It’s been chosen for the biennale.
Don’t ever say yes to Time and Materials.
We can't kill him. He's only halfway done with the decoupage on my formal club.
It's not vandalism. It's our Community Wall Project for street artists.
Somehow, there is something misleading about their ad saying everything on their menu is locally grown.
When did he get opposable thumbs?
Too bad we burned all that papyrus.
He may still have a tail but his art is more evolved than ours.
You tell him that his artwork, to date, is no damned good!
It's just a free trial period. We can cancel anytime before the next moon.
I tried to talk him down, but he said he doesn't do art just for exposure anymore.
That's it! I've had enough, it's time to make this cave great again!
I thought you said there was NO cover charge.
"Don't worry. He's harmless. Just one of the Graffiti Gang from five caves down the mountain.
He calls himself a folk artist, but I think he's a croc of you know what!
Let's fuck it.
I thought decorators were extinct.
Primitive-neuvou, I would venture.
He's one of those new designer dinosaurs; he would rather draw you than eat you.
oops wrong cave club weaving must be next door!
"Enterior Decorator?...uge, it be just a passing fad".
It's reverse engineering.
His shtick is sooooo yesterday.
Not bad for a daVincisaurus
Must have come out of one of those rocks I brought in last year!
I always have a dinosaur come in to decorate the cave while I'm out.
You have to start doing better background checks, do you want to live with this thing!
It's the best way to track his fitness progress!
Trick or Treat!
He claims to be a news reporter, but he's definitely not one of us.
He does it by taste memory
If he sells, do we get a commission?
He's intimidating, but a rock solid Scratchy Realist.
Should we be wielding pencils instead of clubs?
Are its pictures magic or art for art's sake?
Be careful, I’ve heard the charcoal is mightier than the club.
You did not tell me we were going to a Styg Imoloch exhibit.
Well, I don’t know Art, but I know what I like!
Talk about a smear campaign.
I waited two years for this, Whitney?
Just wait until the asteroid hits.
When am I going to stop being held responsible for his wall drawings?
Best ladies night ever.
It's part of his therapy program - releasing his inner suarus.
You can't eat a stylized pterodactyl. Trust me, I've tried!
The graffiti is getting out of control. He's got to go.
He’s my ghost writer
In 30,000 years his descendants will be able to roll over.
Posting art on his wall is SO last millenium.
He claims he never makes mistakes; he just has happy accidents.
I think we ought to leverage his talent.
His work will be worth more after we eat him.
I think we are on his hit list.
It's primitive alright—not to mention the crap on the walls.
His Ancestery test showed he was related to Bansky.
I hope he goes extinct one day.
Ok, Gog, it's time to draw an asteroid for our arrogant intruder.
It's my first attempt at outsourcing. I call it dinosourcing.
Do you believe in science or Buddhism?
His last will and testament.
Don't worry, soon we'll be done with these terrorists.
Such a cold blooded thing to do.
Years from now, people will remember that the greatest artist of our time worked on my den.
Just an appetizer? You’ve to order more than that, sir ! We’re being asked to make America big again....
I've always been attracted to artists....
Good taste?? No TASTES GOOD!
It's a bit out of date....
The cave paintings will add some visual interest while we are waiting for the invention of wallpaper.
OK, I'll concede. He does draw pretty well for a five year-old.
Looking at the diorama you can see how our more primitive ancestors used to act.
The original Banksy.
He doesn't know that, after he's through, we're downsizing his entire species.
He calls himself Kinko.

He's going to try to show us his "friends" again.
Before I tell you tonight’s specials, may I recommend that if you hear “Fee-fi-fo-fum”, beat it.
Why do I feel like somehow we'll be blamed for this?
Like that will make him caveman.
These grafitisaurs are becoming real pests!
That's our ghostwriter!

The best 3D rendering I ever saw.
What really happened in Lascaux...
Yes, but will his oeuvre stand the test of time?

I had a pre-Raphaelite for dinner last night!
I told you the graffiti wasn't mine.
The wife says Mural, I say Fresco.
He finally looks satisfied.
Jurassic Park would have been less bitey if they let the dinosaurs paint.
Whose home is this to begin with?
Aliens, they're always taking our jobs.
Air BNB to a dinosaur? Really?
I think we're "evolving" backwards.
Abstract Expressionism maybe, but can she cook?
They say that his name is Picassosaurus.
I always thought he was a lefty.
His mother told him he's one of us
It's Halloween. He's my kid's art teacher.
Looks like he's working on some scale drawings.
Ever since we asked him in to come to our cave we are looking more and more stupid. How will they think about us in a few million years from now?
I told you he went to art school
I knew you would call his new work anachronistic.
I only got him in to do the cave over in apple blossom pink

Does your pet lizard think he is Picasso or something?
He began working in an abstract style, but found more satisfaction with figurative.
That's no ectotherm!
Picasso? Don't be so anachronistic.

Two words: mass extinction.
Darn lizard graffiti artists! How are we gonna explain this to future generations?
Nice composition and sophisticated technique, but his style is completely derivative.

Banksy he's not.
You're the great hunter. You tell him.
A new Talent to sponsor for the art market
Do you think we're supposed to tip him when he's done?
It balances out – the portions are appallingly small.
I find his rudimentary use of shading and light to be pedantic, his work is utterly vulgar.
It's fake news! We're vegans!
Jeez Bruce, you said you were painting that.
I much prefer the wild, free-range type to the cultivated ones.
I knew it! And in the future we'll be blamed for them.
The galling thing is that this smart ass dinosaur does better art than we do.
I don't think it is modern art.
When did he start standing?
Maybe we should just wait this one out and see what happens.
I know he's a dinosaur ... but look at that designed play. Brilliant!
These days, everyone thinks they can create satisfying art.
Derivative of whom?
He's into food porn.
I prefer his Cretaceous period.

It's a good restaurant, but I don't fancy this month's dessert.
How can we be top of the food chain and main course?
1) I couldn't refuse... we eat him if we don't like what he's doing with the place. 2) Wait till you see the kids room. 3) I'm not a complete Neanderthal. Of course I'll let it finish before we enjoy our dinner.
