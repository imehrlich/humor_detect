Thanks, kid, I've been in there since your parents' wedding.
Listen, if you want to talk to my supervisor, rub the coffee maker.
Toast, Master?
Thanks, Master! For awhile there, I thought I was toast!
Rub all you like, kid. All you're gonna get is toast.
World peace? When you so obviously need a blender?
Hi, I'm the genie with the light brown hair. You may adjust the setting if you want it darker.
Could you please rub the coffee pot? I need to talk to my wife.
Oh, a Hamilton seat!! I thought you said a Hamilton-Beach.
Sorry, kid, if I could make America great, I wouldn't be living in a toaster.
The lamp was great, but the toaster has internet.
Make a different wish, your bagel is really stuck.
I know it's not customary, but the last guy rubbed me the wrong way.
It wasn't plugged in. You have two more wishes.
Your first wish is a Pop Tart?
Two wishes remaining. Maybe aim a little higher than 'fix the toaster?'
This place is way better, has two skylights and an elevator.
Next time disable your pop-up blocker.
I've been updated to work across multiple devices
You get 3 slices...
I can fix the toaster but I still say you'd be better off wishing for a new one.
Yeah, but it's a dry heat.
I would have been here sooner but I had to find a way around the Travel Ban.
With this travel ban, it was the only way I could get into the country.
Rub me the wrong way and you're toast
Take three more. I couldn't get all the crumbs out either.
An edible gluten-free bread loaf? I'm a genie, not a miracle worker.
What can I say, kid? It's roomier and has central heating and an elevator.
Yes, I can fit into the coffeemaker too. But that will be number two and I think you're missing the point here.
You know, it's really pretty easy to make it yourself.
That was the old days. Now you get three apps.
Yes kid, living in a toaster does have it's ups and downs.
Listen carefully; the options have changed.
OK, your 'Hot Pockets' will never again be cold in the middle. What's wish number two?
I found this a better way to get into the country!
Your knish is my command.
"Light," "Medium," and "Dark" are the only 3 wishes I'm allowed to grant.
I am your toastmaster.
Don't rub the coffee pot. I can't stand that guy.
Toast is easy. The last guy wished to be president.

A bagel and coffee is two wishes
Gotta keep moving around; I may be magic, but I'm not documented.
Your knish is my command.
Thanks kid, I was nearly toast.
You have no idea how few people think to rub a toaster.
We don't do slang. You ask for bread, you get bread.
You can ask him, but fair trade, shade grown, and dark roast are going to count as three separate wishes.
Let me get this straight. It's world peace, the girl of your dreams, and a tall Colombian roast?
No way! That magic lamp is the FIRST place the ICE agents will look!
I ate your pop-tarts so you get an extra wish.
It's fixed, but I suggest that you not waste any more wishes on appliances.
If you were 600 years old you'd need some help popping out of things too.
No one uses lamps anymore. We're all connected to the Internet of Things.
Coffee first. Then we'll talk wishes.
whatever you do, don't rub the coffee maker.
You know, it'll just pop out when it's ready. You don't need me to keep checking.
Actually you only get one wish, but I could throw in a free toaster.
Thank you, master. I like it much better. It has electric heating, a skylight, and 2 rooms instead of one.
For New York, that's a lot of space!
You've used two wishes and you still have a studio apartment?
I'm the pleasant one. The coffee genie is somewhat bitter.
Toast? One of your three wishes is toast?
Yes, well I winter in the toaster
Sorry, even I can't make gluten free bread taste good.
Do you mind condemning me to the coffee pot instead? I've never had a room with a view.
I'm outta here. Tell your parents Hide' N Seek was the third wish.
Asking for gluten free toast counts as two wishes.
It's part of the extended warranty
We transitioned to small appliances years ago.
I don't care if you have another wish left. You wanted Trump, you got him. I'm outta here.
Sorry, but I burnt your first wish.
I've fixed the coffee-maker and the toaster, but couldn't this third wish have something to do with, say, world peace or the end of hunger?
Gluten free, non fat, AND delicious? I'm a genie, not a miracle worker.
Toaster Genie's not a bad gig-- it's a big improvement over Diaper Genie.
It was just some crumbs stuck in the release. What's your second one?
Well you see, Jimmy, this makes me feel modern and relevant and it scares the crap out of the cat.
Per the latest executive order, we're only allowed into the country if we live in American-made appliances.
Look, you want avocado on it, that's another wish.

Anything you'd like as long as it's toast.
You wanted a genius on the West Coast? I thought you said, 'genie who makes the best toast.'
Oh yeah.. I moved to a place with central heating.
It's fixable, but you'll need to use another wish to extend the warranty.
OK, toaster's fixed. Your second wish?
Are you sure this isn't a job for Mr. Coffee?
You know, all you had to do was plug it in...
It was a nasty divorce, and she got the lamp.
My wife is in the lamp, and I'll give you ten wishes NOT to rub it.
Hotter coffee, seriously?
Kid, I haven't lived in that thing in years. At my age, I need all the help I can get to pop up.
Toaster's fixed, but we should talk priorities.
My wife got the lamp in the divorce.
You sure you don't want me to fix world hunger instead?
My new place has two bedrooms, heat and an elevator.
Wait, you said Hampton Beach? I thought you said Hamilton Beach!
Wishes? No. Waffles? I got.
You have two more wishes, but you're out of counter space.
Let's think beyond household appliances for our third wish, shall we?
Here's your toaster and thank you for opening an account with The First Bank of Saudi Arabia.
You're getting nothing until I've had my coffee.
Trump is Toast,Jose...your next wish?
Okay, kid, the toaster is fixed. Now do yourself a favor and wish for an imagination.
Okay I fixed the toaster, what's next?
I decided to retire to a warmer place.
I made a move on Alexa and got shipped to the toaster
You have one wish and it had better be good, because otherwise I'm toast.
If you want more than one wish you're going to have to unplug me and plug me back in.
Toaster's fixed. What's your second wish?
I’ll grant you three wishes... four if you clean out that crumb tray.
I don't know where you got the idea of a genie in a magic lantern. It's simply more fake news. Just ask the guy in the coffee maker.
Give me my lamp back and I'll quit burning your toast.
I've relocated. The toaster has free internet.
The last lady wished I was hotter.
I shall offer you three settings.
Now try rubbing the coffee pot.
I love it! Two rooms and central heating?! When can I move in?
I got hacked. Your 3 wishes are with a blender in Moscow.
Forget that - help my sister - she's  in the blender.
I'm the genie with the light brown toast.
Actually, I'm a Sikh. We don't grant wishes.
I got transferred.
What, you were expecting Pop-Tarts?
Jeannie got the lantern in the divorce.
I was able to sweep out most of the crumbs, but you really ought to put a little more thought into your next wish.
Sorry, Aladdin's on vacation. I'm his cousin, Amuffin.
I'd like to help but I'm burned out.
I'm going to stay in the toaster. Someone might think that's a Neti-pot.
If you rub the lamp I'm toast.
Okay, the toaster is clean. What is your second wish?
Sorry, weird night. Would you mind wishing for some coffee?
No. I'm Crusty. Genie is in the garage door.
It's just easier to pop out of the toaster.
Sorry, the only three wishes the toaster genie can grant are light, medium and dark.
Fixed it. Next wish?
Listen, kid. You got that lamp at the dollar store. I'll sleep where I want.
To be honest, I thought we were playing hide and go seek.
It was the only way I could get into the country.
I'll give you an extra wish if I can live in the coffee maker instead.
She got the lamp in the divorce.
The missus and I are going through a bit of a rough patch; this is only temporary.
Had you taken the extended warranty, I could grant your wish.
You forgot to download the GPS update again, didn't you?
Please, please don't tell the lamp. The toaster means nothing to me.
Yeah, well you don't look like Larry Hagman either.
I'm like Alexa, but with more personality
Square footage, central heating, and coffee next door. Win, win, win.
I grant you three settings.
Sorry, but even I can't figure out how to clean the crumbs out of this thing.
Would you mind rubbing the coffee pot so my wife can join us, too?
Nice place. It's even got an elevator.
You have three wishes so long as they involve white, whole wheat or rye.
Because no one wants to rub a toaster.
It's a new thing. I grant you 3 knishes.
Wishes, no, but I can offer three settings.

I winter in the toaster.
I went electric in '65.
OK, fine, but if you think I'm screwed up try rubbing the Mr. Coffee.
This is what happens when you waffle.
Well, you certainly wasted the first one.

May I remind you your next two wishes do NOT have to be toast related?
I can't fix it either.
Sorry, kid. I'm the G.E.nie.
I don't do the lamp anymore, kid. I'm now part of the Internet of Things.
I'm not going to ask why you were rubbing the toaster.
When was the last time you cleaned that thing?
Oh, for goodness sake. My grandfather has been looking for that.
Sorry for the delay, I had a date with a pop tart.
Yeah, but it's a dry heat.
Sorry, the only wishes I can grant are "light," "medium" or "dark."
I think you just burned your last wish.
Genie-ology wasn't my strong suit. Your results may vary.
2 rooms and heat's included
Its three choices, not three wishes.... White, Whole Wheat or Pumpernickel...
OK bagels will never get stuck in the toaster again. What is your second wish?
Toaster's fixed. But the fridge needs a large appliance genie.
Unfortunately, with that lantern, instead of getting three wishes you get three appliances.
That was your last wish...I'm toast.
For the third one, I'd suggest a blender or possibly a juicer.
Toast is done. Coffee is brewing. You got one wish left...
Sorry, I can only grant wishes that are gluten free.
No, I'm not here to grant a wish. You were about to burn your toast.
Just gonna' lay low here until this Muslim ban blows over.
Sorry kid, I got this sponsor years ago. Now I'm a GEnie!
This thing works like magic.
Don’t ask. Just make three wishes before I’m toast.
You called the Internet of Things, Master?
Why do you think we're all brown?
Sorry kid, your wishes are toast.
You have three wishes, light, medium or burnt
Wish granted! You are now the toast of the town.
Sorry. That model is no longer supported.
It's a tight fit at breakfast, but other than that, I prefer it over the lamp.
Actually, I'm the one that opens the garage door.
It's clear of crumbs, but maybe aim a little higher with the next two.
The last guy rubbed me the wrong way
Since the divorce, I live in the toaster.
I’m not the only one in this office you’ve rubbed the wrong way
You coulda had a fourth wish, but nooooo, you wouldn't wish me a cup of coffee.
Just to clarify...you can have three wishes, but you can still only have 2 slices of toast.
The travel ban makes it impossible to come in a lamp.
No, No not three wishes. Your choices are light, dark, or burnt.
It's a trick I learned from Mr. Coffee.
It's Gene actually.
Sorry, kid, Mr. Coffee and I have been living a lie.

Okay but are you honestly that lazy?
This is temporary. I'm airbnbing my place for the weekend.
Not genie, GE
Rub me wrong again and you're toast.
When you said you had a toasty double unit my thinking was something in West Palm.
I've been up for 1001 nights. I need a lot of coffee before any wish-granting.
Viennese bakery just down the block and YOU wish for a goddamned toaster strudel?
No, I'm Joe from appliances.
The crumbs are gone. What's your last wish?
I flipped the lamp and I've sublet the toaster. I'll be crashing in the coffee pot until I find a new place.
Nah, I'm good in here, but I bet the Diaper Genie would be willing to move.
Sorry, couldn't fix it. Any other wishes?
Sorry, I was working on my tan.
You're absolutely sure that your final wish is a blender?

Somebody rubbed me the wrong way.
Abracadabread?
If you try and wish for infinite wishes, I swear to god, I'm throwing myself in the bathtub.
Coming from a lamp is so last millennium.
You'll never guess who's in the coffee maker!
Then she said to me, "If you let him win in November, you're toast."
You were expecting maybe Mr. Coffee?
You have one of three wishes... light, dark, or English muffin
You're beginning to rub me the wrong way.
You used up your wishes Donald. You are young, have a full head of hair and Mueller is off your tail. Now leave me alone.
I unstuck the bagel,kid. You have two more wishes.
Because it has skylights, double beds, integrated heating AND a two-year warranty.
Thanks. That place was crummy
Frankly, you rub me the wrong way.
You wish I were a waffle?
Is it me, or is it hot in here?
Your toaster has been hacked.
Sorry - two slots, two wishes.
One bagel. Sliced. Toasted. Cream cheese. That's already four wishes.
Okay, it's clean. I can't believe you wasted a wish on that.
Always wishes! What about your needs?
You didn't expect me to pop up just anywhere, did you?

The toaster is my winter home.
I'd love to help you, but I'm a little burnt out.

I also respond to "open sesame bagel".
A thoughtful wish, master, but really the lamp is fine.

You rubbed the "toast" app. For wishes you'll have to download the "Aladdin" app
Your last wish is toast!?
I don't do wishes, I do breakfast. What'll it be?
Ever since Alexa dumped me I've been living in the toaster.
You get three wishes--four, if you clean the crap out of my toaster.
Yeah, but this new place has central heating!
Thanks for finding an oil lamp. The toaster is no place for a genie.
How about one wish and I throw in the coffee maker and the toaster?
Sorry, kid, I can't figure out what the dial does either.
Rub the lamp, quick, or I'm toast!
Sorry, you phone is really wedged in there. You are going to have to tell your parents.
white, wheat, or rye?
I upgraded to a double-wide.
You should try the coffee machine next, I hear he gives out five wishes.
I switched to the toaster 'cause ICE tracked me to your lamp!

Because your mom used it to make tea!
OK; I got that bagel out of there for you. Two more wishes.
Your dad's keys are in his blue jacket.
You wished for less dependence on oil

It's about time. I thought I was toast.
You want rye or wheat?
Sorry, I was just getting warmed up.
It happens, what can I say? If you think this is weird, try rubbing the coffee maker!
This toaster works like magic!
Heat's included in the rent, and I can grab a coffee next door.
No more lamp for me--that's the first place ICE would look.
I'm not going back. I found a two bedroom.
I can't get the damn English muffin out of there either!
Suggest using your last wish to avoid back pain in adulthood.
Maybe wish for another outlet?
Suprised? You should see who lives in the coffee maker.
You have three wishes or two toasted bagels: your choice.
You may open sesame, but you may also open poppyseed or cinnamon-raisin.

Three wishes and you asked for toast?
Oil prices were killing me
You should see the perky little genie that lives in the coffee pot.
No, but I can grant a lifetime supply of everything bagels.
Seriously? You chose Bagel?
You're kidding. You want me to trade this spacious, mid-century modern with radiant heating for that?

Sorry, but the Poptart people made me a better offer.
Couldn't you wish for something besides toast?
Your wish comes with a side order of toast.

Well, yeah, technically I live in the lamp but I shower in the coffee pot and sauna in the toaster. Why?
OK, two more wishes. Put some thought into these, OK?

You got the wonder. You didn't get the bread.
Sorry, but your Mom is on her new yacht and won't be back. But hey, her third wish was that I take care of you. You want some coffee?

You have three wishes - light, medium or dark.
The lamplord raised the rent, so I move to this two-room place. Having a problem with the heat, though.
OK, they're clean as a whistle. And your second wish?
It won't set off your smoke alarm anymore, but I still think it's a waste of a wish.
Please say you believe in genies or else I'm toast!
Forget the lamp. At your age you better start realizing what you rub and what you don't.
You have three wishes: light, medium or burned to a crisp
I was getting sick of the lamp, but I am getting great rates for it on Airbnb.
Touch the lamp again and you're toast.
What, you've never gone back to the wrong apartment after a few too many?
I'd give it a minute if I were you
What are you a Luddite? We've moved on to modern appliances.
Sorry kid, coffee is extra...
No toast today, loser. You rubbed me the wrong way.
Your "smart" toaster has malware and even I can't fix it.
Did you say GE or Genie?
Your 3 wishes can only be....Toast, English Muffins or Bagels.
This is much more comfortable than that old lamp, Master - but don't rub it while it's hot!
The last guy asked for a ‘toasted sand-wish’.
Be careful what you wish for or I'm toast.
The TV remote’s not in here either. One wish left.
If you think about it, a great slice of toast is a lot like world peace or having infinite wealth.
I'm done with you. With these guys I get toast and coffee whenever I want.
Rub the coffee pot, Sonny. The rest of my family needs to get out.
For centuries I give away treasures. And what do I get? Crumbs! So I ask you, why not the toaster, huh?
Look, I tried -- but even I can't get it to toast in less than a minute and half...
I stay in the toaster now. No one polishes it anymore.
Oh, lamps are so passe. After two-thousand years, I modernized.
No, it's definitely three 'wiches. What do you want on your first?
It's just for a week, it's a special promotion.
I just moved.
Well, forget about wish #1. That old English Muffin just ain't budging.
This is not what I envisioned when they said I was being transferred somewhere warmer.
Call it crummy, but at least this unit includes heat.
I got whole wheat, multi-grain, rye, pumpernickel, or country white. Your wish is my command.
Ah, my young master, you should see what comes out of the microwave!
Sesame bagels....
It's too dangerous in the lamps. Three of my cousins got deported.
For your last wish, may I suggest that you think outside the bread box?
I repeat, "ANY three kinds of toast you choose!"
Still cheaper than Brooklyn
If you want me to appear out of the lamp you'll need a different adapter.
A billion dollars? No, I distinctly heard "coffee and toast."
Yes, you may have a cup of coffee. I don't care what your Mom says.
Well ... it was cold in that thing ... this one has central heating!
That lamp is toast.
Times change....and it has power.
Now I smell like cinnamon toast. I hope you're happy.
Your choice. You can have: the toaster, the coffee maker, or what's inside the dishwasher.
Wanna meet Mr. Coffee?
And that's how you use the magic bagel setting....
I used my points for an upgrade.
Seriously, all you want are Pop-Tarts?
This is nothing. Rub it again and watch the coffeemaker.
What!? It gets cold in that damned lamp.
Hey, the new place has heat and room for two.
Sorry, but I ran out of wishes a long time ago. Best I can do is light, medium or dark.
It's not as nice, but I saved a ton on heating last year.
In gratitude for my release, I offer you three toasts.
Nah, it's two wishes now. Light or dark.
Don't waste your wish. You can't make these things toast evenly on both sides.
"Damn it! I'm a Genie, not an electrician.
At my age, I need the pop-up lift of a toaster.
Look, you got your three wishes: the toaster, the coffeemaker and the dishwasher. No more.
How about you grant me a wish and get some heat in your damn apartment.
Most people would have asked for more wishes.
If I hadn't gotten out of there, I'd be toast.
It's like AirBNB for genies.
What, you think I come by this great tan naturally?
Sorry kid. GPS is great but not perfect.
Sorry, quantum interference--it's the two-slit issue again.
Look, if I don't get back into that lamp pronto, I'm toast.
I don't love the central heating, but I really needed a bigger place.
Sorry, no more wishes. After I fix this your mom wants work done on your dad.
Why didn't you just wish for a chef?
Sorry kid, some other genie is already working on the "Make America Great Again" wish.
And for your final wish, might I suggest a blender?
And when the toast is ready, do you wish for butter?
White, rye or marble?
It's got heat, a second bedroom, and plenty of free bagel crumbs. You should check it out.
Wheat or white?
OK. That's three. 1. get the crumbs out 2. lock it on Medium Dark and 3. have it tell the following classic joke every time you put in your bagel, "What does the devil say when he welcomes you to Hell? --'Would you like those buns toasted?'"
Are you sure you want to be the toast of the town?
Why do you insist on rubbing me the wrong way?
Joe received a fourth wish, overcoming 4,500 years of precedent because the bagel really was stuck in there.
Let me get some coffee and we'll try this again.
I usually summer somewhere warm.
"Your third and final wish is 'a perfect slice of toast'? Are you sure?!
Well Timmy, while you were showing off the lamp at school I had to drink my way out of the coffee pot. Now I'm in here drying off.
I'm just saying, trying to be a little more careful with wishes two and three. Okay?
Times have changed. It's two bedrooms and electric heat for crying out loud.
Even genies need winter homes.
I'm an eGenie.
Coffee and toast is two wishes.
WHEN ELECTORAL COLLEDGE MAKES TRUMP PRESIDENT, TOASTER MAKES GENIE.
New sponsor, I'm now the official GE-nie.
As you get older you'll learn to appreciate central heating.
So this is what they meant by "Wonder Bread."
No. You see, I'm 10,000 years old. I need help to pop up.
I'm taking today off , I got toasted last night.
You burnt your last wish
It's so much warmer with central heating
I don't grant wishes. I just make the toast pop up.
Why did I move? It wasn't the heat; it was the humidity
I had to move. The toaster is rent controlled - the lamp is not.
Sorry, your lamp lost its internet connection and I had to come through the toaster.
Okay, from now on the toaster will burn everything that is not a poptart.
You've got to unplug the coffee maker first."
Sorry kid, I don't grant wishes, but I'll be happy to make you some toast.
Yes, I'm gluten free.
For awhile there I thought I was toast.
Thanks, it was getting a little toasty in there.
It's just me and a few friends, though you may want to wish for a new toaster.
I can grant you 3 wishes, or two slices of toast.
I was working on my tan!
"Got it...no more burnt toast. you still have TWO left.
I just started using Airbnb.
Sorry, defrosting the freezer would be considered a separate wish.
What? You've never wanted to move where it's warmer?
I'd really like to help you, but the Tump administration is toasting Muslims.
It was just a loose wire, and yes, that was your last wish.
No, I appear when you empty the crumb tray.
You're really gonna waste one of your wishes on a cup of decaf?
I'd like to make a toast.
Well, Trump was using the coffee pot as a camera.
What made you think I'd know how to make breakfast?
A keurig. A microwave. And what else would you loke, son?
I'm 2000 years old. You can't expect me to understand the Internet of Things.
Are you sure you want to use your first wish on Pop-Tarts?
I got an upgrade.
Yeah it's crumby but it's dual rooms with a view of the carafe.
A converted duplex, all electric. A lot of bread, but it's worth it.
Some of the guys and I decided to switch to a more accessible appliance.
Butter and jam on toast will use up all three.
I wish you were more creative.
I will grant you three wishes...provided they fall between the settings of light and dark.
Not now, kid, I've got a date with a tempest in a teapot.
I'm not going in there. There's no cell coverage.
What'd expect, an eggo?
I'm sort of like the hermit crab of genies.
I'm not moving back until you pour out the chamomile.
It's my man cave.
It's a Toastmaster. What do you expect?
Sorry, there's a bug in my Genie Positioning System.
Quick, rub it again! My Cousin is in the coffee maker.
Do you know how to work this thing?
It's called the Internet of Things, kid.
Things have changed. I need Wi-Fi now.
I popped in as quickly as I could.
Is a latté with three shots one wish, or three?
Wi-Fi's out. Had to find another hotspot.
Don't mind me, I was coma-toast.
I like my buns toasted!
Sorry, but lightly browned toast is harder than you might think.
I'm toast!......Kidding.....
Well... I think this arrangement makes the counter less cluttered.
"Wait 'till you see what the coffee machine can do".
Seriously? You wished for a Pop Tart?
OK, but after the Vita-Mix, I get the lamp back.
The dishwasher was full.
I can't believe that you wished for a Pop Tart!
It's easier to get out of the toaster.
My wife wanted more space. So we moved to the toaster.
... and you also get your choice of bagel.
I've upgraded to a two-bedroom
Dude, get over it. All I got is English muffin, sour dough or whole wheat.
Central heating AND a spare room!
The lamplord raised the rent.
Is it hot in here, or is it just me?
Infinite Pop Tarts as per your command! Next wish?
I didn't see the rest of your bagel. Next wish?
I can grant you three kinds of toast: whole wheat, pumpernickel, and rye.
What? You expect me to stay on the mantel when there's free coffee in here?
Make it quick. Aladdin’s on the other lamp.
Your three wishes are toast.
I can't turn a PopTart into a Cronut
I was hungry. Is that a problem?
That is the best Tanning Salon I've ever been in.
Well, the lamp has not been updated in a 1,000 years, and the toaster is wired for cable.
A third wish will void the warranty.
Alexa, make the coffee!
You don't need to wish for dark toast. There's a setting for that.
So, you want it with cream cheese or not?
Everyone rubs a lamp, but no one will think to bother me here.
I'll have to ask my boss to see if I can do World Peace.
Thanks for the upgrade!
Smart" homes don't mesh well with old technology.
The internet of things just got very weird.
..and for your second wish I'd recommend the decaf.
.... and yesterday I found my keys in the refrigerator.
It's only temporary until the magic lantern passes emissions.
Really? Are you sure you only want toast?
Sorry! Bank foreclosed on the lamp and moved me to one of their toasters!!
While you're making wishes, get a new coffeemaker
Now you know why the toast won't come out.
Because I don't like coffee, okay.
I can turn on your coffee machine, raise your thermostat, push down the toaster , and upgrade you to Prime, but I can't do all four."
Really? You want a pop tart!
Ok,toaster fixed .Now for your next two wishes.
Light, medium or dark? Choose carefully!
Rumor has it that Barbara Eden got stuck in the coffee pot. Try rubbing that one.
I am sorry but your wish is toast.
As I said, your Genie will love it here, more square footage and central heating.
'Top brown only' function -- repaired! And your final wish?
I'm a snowbird. That's my winter home.
I thought you knew I was on vacation.
Things got confused when Aladdin opened the Best Buy.
Fuck the New Yorker cartoon choosers.
Master, I think you mother may have lied. By my inspection, this toaster would accept white bread.
For releasing me from my prison the reward is white, whole wheat, or rye. I can also offer regular or decaf.
Clean the crumb tray and you get your wishes.
Next time call Siri!
The Housing Authority said it was an upgrade. Better heating.
I strongly suggest that you use your last wish on something other than fixing the kitchen appliances...
Do you have anything with more than 2 rooms?
My agent said I needed to go electric to still be relevant in the on-demand economy.
This place is rent stabilized.
Ok seriously, for the last time... does that look like a tea kettle to you??
Hi. I've been hiding in this toaster since your dad asked for a stock tip and I told him "Knucklebones are best."
You can now summon me hands free.
It's going to be hot in summer, but it's a lot more comfortable than that rusty old teapot.
All the old lamps were gentrified by white ghosts
The genie in the lamp? Sorry, kid – I'm just the ghost in the machine.
It's not the heat. It's the gluten.
I'm sorry Barron, even a Genie can't change who your parents are........
So I'm the appliance Genie... what's it to you?
Yeah, I know the toaster's cheaper, but the coffee pot has an open floor plan.
Ask me after I have coffee.
Sorry, but my previous Master told me that if I showed up again, I'd be toast.
Well, you just burned through one wish.
"New amps for old".
No, I'm Genie, not Siri!
No guarantees on your wishes until I've had my coffee.
I use the second bedroom for an office.
I'm from the temp agency.
Are you sure you asked for a Roadster?
Well, I wish you'd clean out the crumb tray once in while!
This is my summer house.
Why, kid? Because you just rub me the wrong way, that's why.
Sure, but you must first provide a credit card and agree to the terms and conditions etched in inside the lamp.
What is your wish? Light, medium, or well done?
Three Wishes and this is the best you can do?
Put the lamp away, kid--I'm not going to indulge you in your childish stereotypes.
Here's a wish, I wish you'd stop putting everything bagels in here.
Sorry, I was visiting my neighbors.
You have three wishes; light, medium and dark.
I am an itsy-bitsy, teenie-weenie, Caption Contest toaster genie.
I'm used to a warmer climate.
Did you wish I would come out of the Toaster, instead?
I'm sorry but the bagel is really stuck in there.
No! That's a tea pot and yes, I'm a genie in a toaster.
Is strawberry jam your third wish?
You rub me the wrong way.
That's ONE!
Were you expecting a pop tart!
Sure, it lacks the same charm, but it's got central heating.
Sorry, kid--coffee's self-service.
I'll grant you 'four' wishes, if you put me on a separate circuit.
You get three wishes and unlimited toast
I relocated to a warmer place
I tried using the microwave, but my earrings lit up and blew the fuse.
Because I've eco-shifted from oil lamp heating to electric.
Now make a wish that does not involve me.
Moved into a two bedroom, newer building but heat's included
Would you mind using one of your wishes to get me out of this toaster?
If you wanted Barbara Eden you should have asked for Jeannie with a J.
I am here to grant you three slices.
I had to move out while the place was being painted.
It was supposed to be a congratulatory toast.
Oh, you found it.
Hey dude! You rubbed me the wrong way.
I don't care what Aladdin got. I grant 3 dishes.
Didn't you get my change of address email?
There is an App for that now.
Look kid, I'm a genie, not the Maytag repair man. Why don't you just wish for a new toaster?
If you just want to know when the coffee is ready, ask Alexa.
Your second wish is toast.
You are granted three pieces of toast.
I will grant you three wishes - one light, one dark, and one medium.
But this one has central heating.
Unlimited Pop-Tarts? Really?
Yes, but I'm the genie of BURNING desires.
Look! ...This is the third time today,  and I still can't figure out Health Care!
I much prefer the warmth of this two-bedroom.
I'm a very well-bred genii.
Ive been tanning - what did Trump do today?
That pop-tart's totally stuck - just wish for your mom not to freak out.
The crumb tray is clear. That's one.
Cream and sugar count as two separate wishes.
I'm upgrading my user interface.
The lamp was nice, but now I'm in an all-electric kitchen.
We don't support those anymore. THIS thing is already, like, three upgrades old.
Sorry...I just can't handle a nonfat, five pump, double foam wish with this primitive equipment
This didn’t happen before you installed the IoT upgrade.
You can wish, but I'm still going to burn the toast.
The toaster wished for three more wishes.
New Genie Rules: You get 3 wishes, buy the first 2 have to be toast and coffee.
I'm the breakfast genie...you can only ask for coffee, toast and eggs.
Your Alexa keeps the thermostat down too low.
I guess he wasn't kidding when he tweeted he was going to add magic lamps to the travel ban.
We all have wishes, kid. I wish I had a bagel setting.
You caught me while I was at my Airbnb.
I will grant you three waffles.
Utilities are included.
Yes, but your three wishes are limited to poppy, sesame seed and garlic.
Our genie's union negotiated better accommodations.
At least in this thing I am warm and I get to pop out every little bit...
Dude, you got a lot of crumbs in there.
Oh that's the OLD lamp. My new place has central heating.
I've been looking for something with two bedrooms.
Given the scary state of the world, I now work from remote locations.
Oh, Sorry...apartment hunting...
I've made coffee and washed the dishes. What's your third wish?
And you don't even have to rub this one.
The toaster is so much more open concept than the lamp.
If your wish happens to be toast, this is your lucky day!
Thanks. It was toasty in there!
Your wish is my command but we're out of whole milk for your cappuccino.
The toast is almost done, for your third and final wish should I start the coffee?
Kid, do you really want to waste one of your wishes on a lousy pop tart??
I can grant you three wishes. But they have to be thinner than a bagel.
Sorry, I burnt the pop tart you wanted. It's my first day. How about a free wish?
Actually it's quite roomy for Manhattan standards.
Rub the lamp or I'm toast.
Don't just wish for a new filament. I could get you a brand new toaster.
You still get all three; breakfast is part of the deal.
I was cold, so what?
Let me guess....you want avocado toast.
Let's go over the 'wish' protocol one more time!
Magic Toaster genies only grant one wish. I'm afraid the neti pot is all you'll get.
I checked.We're all out of the marble rye.
I understand, but here I get toast and coffee
I've got the toast under control, shall I do the coffee next?
What ? Now you want it buttered ?
Sorry I'm late, I was using the sauna.
White, multi-grain or sourdough?
Don’t rub the coffee maker the wrong way.
Two rooms, heat included.
Jimmy then pondered the physical appearance of Mr. Coffee.
I got cold
I know it's smaller, but my rent is only $1500 a month.
I prefer to stay toasty.
For your final wish may I suggest a Vitamix?
Sorry son, I stepped out for breakfast.
Thanks, it's too hot in there.
I’m working on my tan.
Sorry - I got to get back home or I'm toast.
It's the new policy of non-assigned workplace.
Is that Starbucks coffee?
Wait until you rub the coffee pot.
What a crumby neighborhood.
Ding.
Coffee's not on the wish list until you're thirteen
I'm charging my phone.
Nice duplex.
Back off kid, no Genie grants wishes before his first cup of coffee for the day!
Don't waste a wish on that. Just buy a new one.
It's got central heating.
I might use the other slot as an office.
Needs a new solenoid.
Ever since I cut lamp oil from my diet I've had more energy and focus.
You try living in the crummy place.
The toaster is warmer.
Well, I wish I could enjoy my coffee before we start.
This way I can pop out easier.
It was a pop up decision.
I'm Gene now."
You wished for a toaster oven that actually toasts. That appears to be impossible. Try this.
I have a wish for you... can you clean out the crumbs?
Be careful with that thing. I almost got electrocuted.
I like my new home, it's toastier.
No, I am not the gluten-free genie!
It's rent controlled
I'm not going back in the bottle until I've had my coffee!
It's my summer home.
For your third wish you should probably move beyond pop-tarts.
Please tell Greg to stop trying to put pizza in here.
Hey kid, I'm not your father's genie.
Toastmasters - it's not just for public speaking.
Three wishes. Light, medium, dark.
'I came straight from the cloud, this must be the wrong IP address'
It's simple. This place offers heat.
Look, I'm sure you've got a very good genie in there, I'm just saying: "do you like bread?"
And her last wish was that I use a toaster from now on.
You have one remaining wish: lightly toasted, medium, or well-done.
The toaster has free WiFi.
Any chance you wish for a decent cup of coffee?
Sorry, kid. Best I can do is grant you three ... uh, two pieces of toast.
Yes , your wish is my command but pop tarts ? Really ?
You preferred it when there wasn't a password??
We're up and running on electricity now, but our real goal is to go wireless.
Does this mean I get toast from this lamp?
Kid, if you're still here when my master comes home, we're both toast.
It's an open sesame and shut case.
I got stuck in a bagel.
Nah, you can keep the lamp, it's nice and toasty in here.
You've got three wishes. But first, can I have some coffee?
Your toast is my command.
Ever since my AA pledge, I just can't hit the bottle anymore.
Actually, you can only wish for toast or a Pop Tart.
Ha ha, yes, very funny, "make the toast genie." Now change your mother back from the coffee machine.
Just a mix up at the factory - they make garage door openers too
Well I wish we had some better coffee around here but you don't see me bothering you about it.
Do I look like Mr. Coffee?
You do know there's an IHOP right around the corner, don't you?
I now offer wishes with the additional options of light, bagel, and extra crispy.
Of course I left. You don't rub me anymore.
I was wishing for an Eggo
Just to be clear, was that toasted bagel wish supposed to be part of your inner monologue?
Let the toastmaster have the honor to introduce you to a few kitchen appliances.
Your wish is toast.
Look, kid, let me explain the new Terms of Service over coffee, okay?
I will grant you 3 toasts.
Stereotype me, fine, but you do NOT get to assume Mr. Coffee's gender
Any three toppings on your bagel.
What? You were waiting for the Muffin Man.
I moved to the toaster. It's warmer and no one eber cleans the outsides
Well, I have to tell you , all your dreams are toast !
Toss the lamp; I'm going solar next week.
Yea, it's roomier, but most important is that the coffee maker is right next to it.
I know it seems strange, but this way I get to hang out with my friend Mr. Coffee during downtime.
I'm fine with the toaster if you're going to use it for a Netie pot.
It's bigger on the inside...
You're too young to invoke the coffee genie, son.
This one's no good, it's been hacked by the Russians.
I'll give you first and last months' rent on the oil lamp.
Are you sure you want to waste a wish on making coffee with the toaster? The coffee machine is right there!
About time you cleaned this toaster
Wish granted! I'm your new dad. Now go ask your mom to buy some Arabian blend.
I'd have come sooner if you texted me.
I don't get reception in there either.
This had better be important. It was nice and toasty in there.
Your wish is my crummand!
You expect me to go back in that lamp, without a crumb to eat?
How about... one wish, a magic carpet ride and I’ll throw in the appliances, too?
We phased out the lamp in 1929. Jeannie had dibs on the last bottle, and after that the boss wanted to modernize.
I'm in here now; just don't rub it while I'm 'toasting a muffin,' if you get my meaning."
Yes, I'm still granting three wishes. But they all have to be for continental breakfast.
I dream of genie with the light brown toast.
It's not that I don't like you, you just rub me the wrong way.
Anyway, after I got priced out of the lamp, I tried the coffee maker, but My Doctor told me to cut back on caffeine...but I really like the neighborhood so here I am
It's really jammed in there. Wish for something else.
Sorry, back now. I was making breakfast.
Cool! Both the lamp and the toaster have blue tooth!
Perfectly browned toast every time as you wish, master -- and I cleaned out the crumb tray. What other miracles do you desire?
I don't do well done.
I wish you weren't a stereotype.
My lamp got hacked. Moved to the cloud and channel through toaster.
I know, I said I preferred it toasty warm, but I didn't mean it literally...
So, a properly toasted bagel is in your top three?
Believe it or not, the rent is way cheaper.
It's because you rub me the wrong way.
Dude, this isn’t Aladdin, I’m not granting you sh**.
You still have 3 wishes, they just have to be breakfast-related
So many kids were asking for Pop Tarts that I just come out of the toaster now.
First, make the coffee.
OK roaches gone. You get two more.
The lamp’s Wi-Fi is down, so lucky you have a smart toaster.
I am NOT toast
The rent is cheaper, and the heat's better. But can you wish me a vacuum?
Yeah, I'm trying to stay with the times. Thinking of moving up to the juice extractor next.
Now put that lamp away. It's not a toy.
Forget that. My sister's in the blender.
Hey, you rub it ten times--I come out of your butt.
Listen kid, if all you want are pop tarts, just go to the supermarket.
Hey, genies get old too...I've moved to a warmer climate.
You can have four wishes as long as one of them is a cup of coffee for me.
What can I say, the lamp gets cold this time of year.
Whats it going to be, immortality or avocado toast?
My wish is that you empty the crumb tray!
The guy in the coffee maker? He's crazy.
no I wished for bikini models by the dozen. Not a genie in a toaster oven.
So. I'm the substitute. What's your wish?
Wrong lamp--you wanted decaf genie.
Lamp, toaster... anything beats being a diaper genie.
Try rubbing the oven
It's a dry heat - arthritis runs in the family.
Alexa sent me.
“rub that thing one more time and you’re toast”…
Three wishes: white, rye, or whole wheat!
Rub the lamp all you want. I'm telling you, in winter, rub the toaster.
Nobody wanted you know this...
This is my winter home, it's much more toasty in here.
They call it "the internet of things".
Really? Leg go your Eggo?
Cleaning the crumbs out of the toaster? I do wishes not miracles.
You know, I could just make you coffee
Now I am the genie of the toaster, your wishes come with a one year manufacturer's warranty.
You really want me to come out of the coffee machine for your last wish?
Just wait until you find out where your toast is!
Rub it again, I need coffee.
What’s with the decaf?
I'm over here this week. I wanted to vacation someplace warm.
My attorney told me that she gets it all. Cool if I crash here?
Sorry kid - Aladdin doesn't do bagels.
So just hit the lever and a Pop Tart will come out. Now what's your second wish?
So your three wishes are a Pizza Pocket, Eggo and a Pop Tart
If you wanted toast, you should've rubbed the breadbox.
Kid, you can rub your mother's gravy boat all you want, but I'm still the genie of her breakfast appliances.
Oh sure it is more spacious than that old lamp, but the neighbors are real crumbs.
You dream of Genie, I dream of a decent cup of coffee.
I'm sick of Darjeeling. I want Arabica.
Jesus man, when was the last time you cleaned that thing?
PLEASE open up the lamp, its hot as hell over here!
I got your coffee maker wish fulfilled. Can I now have my house back ?
It's a time share.
You should check with the dishwasher genie, he might be able to grant that wish.
It's a rent-controlled toaster.
This won't work. I need a place that's gluten-free.
Thanks for getiing me out. Much longer in there and I would've been toast.
Hey, you said to pop up. Two more to go.
Just to be clear, your wish is that I turn into cotton-candy flavored pop-tarts?
What? It's my summer home.
I'll grant you three bagels.
Got any coffee? Long day.
I know you're upset you only get 3 wishes, but saying "this genie is toast" was uncalled for.
When the lamp genii defeated me he said: You're toast! If you want him, try the coffee pot.
I've found a flat with more room.
If you want room for cream that's gonna count as another wish.
You think I was just going to stay in there and wait for you to rub?
No number of wishes guarantees that your toast won't be burnt.
Sorry kid, I've been electric only since Newport '65.
But first coffee.
2 BR, central heating, elevator, next to a coffee shop.
Anything about girls - talk to the guy in the microwave.
Mr Coffee could use a cleaning too.
You can use your other two wishes for toast.
Put that damn thing down before you hurt sombody!
What? I was hungry.
Please don't take me back to Walmart.
If he ever comes out, tell him that toaster genie's looking for him
I've told you before, rub twice for coffee.
Lamp Genie had to go out of town on business. I’m taking his messages.
Well, I wish you would clean out the crumb tray every once in a while.
I can't bring people back form the dead, make them fall in love, or make your toast not slightly burnt.
If you think this is weird, you should see the coffee genie.
Okay, all the gross crumbs are gone. What's your second wish?
You may have anything you wish...light...medium....or dark.
It's a better location and the heat's included in the rent
Do not say avocado toast.
Beware, the toaster oven is a Pandora's box."
The bottle was occupied.
Your wish is my command! As long as it's light, medium or dark.
Sorry, small change in venue. You have three wishes that somehow include toast or toastiness.
Due to our austerity program, the genie of the lamp was let go, and you only get two wishes.
So, it's a deal. You let me live in the coffee maker and I'll work things out with your babysitter.
Perfect coffee. Your next two wishes?
OK, so I popped out of the toaster. Two wishes left.
Now go rub all of the dishes in the sink.
Most guys would ask for a billion dollars, so it's kind of refreshing to grant a wish to clean out the toaster.
Okay, the toaster's fixed. What's your next wish?
So, you were expecting toast???
I prefer a dry heat.
No need; the power has been restored.
Are heating and electric included?
I grant thee two magnificent slices of lightly browned rye.
Sublet the old one. This one has heat included and a pool within wafting distance.
Yes, I would love some tea.
Careful. You have a bagel setting and two more.
What, you were expecting Jesus?
I'm sorry there's nothing I can do about that pop-tart
Lamp, toaster, ... no difference, they're all connected now.
I can't grant three wishes anymore but I toast a nice bagel.
Better health care.
Before we do this, could I get an espresso?
Check it out. I've got central heat!
Way back when, I got a scholarship to NYU, and now I can't resist bagels.
Mom says that I can't grant any wishes until you clean out the crumb tray.
Man, am I glad your back with my repaired lamp. In 5 days absolutely no one has rubbed this toaster!
Every time I come out of there I'm up all night
Next time can you rub the coffee maker? I haven't had a cup in over a century.
"You're telling me your first wish was for a Keurig"?
I wished for the coffee genie.
Word of advice, be careful of what comes out of the coffee pot when you rub it
Before I sign on this new place, is heat included?
I'd love to turn him back into a reality show host, but you already used your third one on "I wish there was a clown in the Office"
I am a free range genie. The lamp was too confining.
Try 'open robusta'
Look kid, no wishes OR toast before I've had my coffee...
Thanks for letting me warm up in the toaster, you wouldn't believe how cold it gets in that lamp.
This makes it easier to just pop up
Is it too late for last week's contest? I only got my magazine yesterday! I wanted to submit a caption for the lady on the phone with all the men standing about, "I need to report the 3-D printer not working right again."
Sorry. I just moved into this new two-room apartment.
Young man, when I was your age, I was the toast of the town.
Hey, it beats a Pop Tart.
The lamp just seemed dated.
Hi, I'm Ali. My brother"s on night shift.
I fixed your toaster. That's wish #1.
Dude, I just want toast.
Pumpernickel, rye, or whole wheat?
I've redirected my traffic to the toaster.
If you're surprised to see me, wait until you see the family living in the coffee maker.
No, you can't but me back in the bottle.
I was sold on its' pop up feature.
And will that be regular or decaf?
Yeah, trying a fourth wish means you're toast.
I'm going to give you a Mulligan since you are new at this. Think bigger than a Pop Tart as one of your three wishes.
I had to move out of the lamp - the rent was too high.
I found it a lot warmer than that cold metal lamp.
This is my winter home.
Kid, that's a pretty tall order for a genie who hasn't even had his first cup of coffee yet. You do know Ivanka's married, right?
Your sauna's broken.
The lamp only gave me a small spark, while I get really charged up from the toaster.
Crumbs are all out. What's your second wish?
White, rye or pumpernickel?
Hang on, I gotta warm up for a minute.
Thank God! It was getting a little toasty in there.
I was just working on my tan.
I upgraded, kid. Finally have free roaming.
You did wish for a hot date with Genie.
Apparently, you couldn’t put the genie back in the bottle.
Sorry, pal. I know you freed me and all, but 'unlimited pumpkin spice coffee creamer' is where I draw the line.
You sure you want to use your last wish on Pop-Tarts?
We'll, I am sure you've heard of the kitchen magician.
The Roll Is Stuck !
I'm still a step up from the Genie of the Dishwasher; with him you only get three dishes.
The microwave was full.
When the boy wished for help waking for the school bus in the morning, the lazy genie condescendingly pointed toward the coffeemaker.
I wish you'd polish something else.
Sorry kid. Your wishes have been limited to light, medium, or burnt.
On the bright side - I just pop out instead of rubbing the lamp.
Keep the lamp. I found a new home that's warmer.
Your only wish is for better coffee?
After I left the lamp I changed my name to Bernie...get it?
You rub me the wrong way.
We're re-branding. Hand-rubbed lamps are uncomfortably suggestive.
The heat went out in my lamp.
You have one remaining appliance request left.
You try living without heat in the winter
My three wishes consist of whole wheat, sourdough and rye.
'It's not in there , do you want me to check the coffeee machine ?'
Are you nuts? Clean your own toaster!
Take it from me. Rub that lamp and you'll be toast.
Poppin' Fresh?
Do you have any Earl Grey?
You have three choices---light, dark or bagel setting.
Yeah? Well I'm wishing for something other than decaf right now.
Can we check out a four slicer with a downtown view next?
If you rub me the wrong way, I won't let go of your Eggo.
I'm getting good money for doing "pop-ups"!
Toasters are the new lamps.
Onion or cinnamon?
Spit it out kid,I don't have a green card, this toaster is my last chance to stick around.
Honey or Jam?
If you're done polishing the lamp can you make another pot of coffee?
Not wishes. Choices. Rye, wheat, or white?
Sorry, kid. The lamp is plastic and I live in a toaster---so no wishes. But I CAN offer you $10 in Kohl cash.
Just once I wish you'd take *my* wishes into account!
Look, I'll grant you three wishes but you have to clean the crumb tray
I'll give you a fourth wish if you rub the coffee pot.
'I've clearly been burned in this deal.'
I was trying to get out of my comfort zone
I'm toast? Is that your wish?
Yeah, I know. But it's my winter house.
Rub it again. My wives are in the coffee.
This is much less cramped. Should've done it 1001 nights ago.
I identify more with the toaster
As you wished but I’m toast. You’ll have to make your own coffee.
White buns only look good on hamburgers.
Keep your lamp ... This is all electric , and I only have to grant two wishes ...
I couldn't pass it up. Heat and trash included and the cafe next door has Free Trade French Roast.
It's not only more temperate but the pop-up function makes for a perfectly accessible exit.
Be very specific -- or you get toast.
Genie's have to be plugged in now.
Brilliant idea, kid. Turns out that if you keep me in the toaster you get FOUR wishes. Shall we try the coffee maker next?
You calling me your POPTART?
I moved to a warmer climate, once I had enough bread to afford it.
THINK BEYOND POP TARTS !!
I can grant any three wishes...unless you wish for toast.
I granted the last guy a skinny, latte, salted caramel, mocca, frappuccino, Americano, Doppio, Espresso so I'm out of soy.
I grant you three wishes - light, burnt, or golden brown.
Keep it. I'm the toast of the town now.
What, you think your toast just pops up on its own? Let me guess, you also believe no one knows it is you reheating salmon in the microwave every day.
Did or did you not say I was the best thing to happen to you since sliced bread?
This way, I'm accessible through the Genie app. Plus I get to pop up dramatically instead of materializing out of a puff of smoke.
Just tell your mother you burnt the toast
Frankly, that's an offensive stereotype. Plus, you can't get 4G in a lamp.
It's rent controlled
I liked the lamp, but this is a sanctuary toaster.
Next time you clean the toaster.
I'm outta 7-grain. You want rye?
O.K. All warmed up now. So, what can I do for you?
Three wishes. Two slices.
I'm more accustomed to a warmer climate.
No. Still my first wish. Starting again. When I toast my parents at their anniversary dinner, I'd like you to fill the air with coloured smoke and sparkly stuff.
Because it's warmer in there.
I upgraded to a two bedroom with heat.
Thanks for the release. I was burning up in there.
Toast's burnt. Sorry, that was your third wish.
"The crumbs are gone and I've cleaned the coffee filter; but I can't clean your room- some things even a genie won't do".
White,Wheat or Sourdough?
. . . and the heat's included.
I'm a "rules were meant to be broken" kinda guy.
Why would you waste a wish asking for a Pop-Tart?
I'm the built-in appliance genie, making sure your toaster doesn't work too well or last too long.
This is the only place I can afford since the lamp got genietrified.
You can adjust the darkness of your wishes in this one.
Lamps are so yesterday.
You forgot to blug it in.
Trade you the toaster and a wish for the Lamp?
This offers much better connectivity
I'm gong back into the lamp, I can't adjust to this all-electric environment.
Did you say gluten free?
To change settings on the lamp, just click the switch one time to the left from "waffles" to "wishes."
Thank you, for awhile I thought I was toast.
You get three gluten-free wishes.
I know kid, but this model comes with its own elevator.
Sorry, my GPS has been a little off lately.
I know what you asked for...but, I can only give you "the toast of the town"!
Well, I wish that your coffee was fresh.
Let this be a lesson to you, son. Never trust those jokers at Toastmasters.
Uhhhh, I was just getting warmed up in there.
Your wish was for a HOT genie.
Your wish is my command. Rye, raisin, or whole wheat?
That Pop Tart flavor is beyond even my power.
Can we see what IKEA has?
I was out with the guys last night and forgot where I was. Guess you could say I got Toasted!!
Don't complain. If it were 1990 this could be a sitcom.
I'm lovin' my new vacation rental, but I'm glad you called.
Sorry, we no longer grant wishes, but I can offer you evenly toasted bagels in six delightful flavors.
With great power comes the need to be connected to the power.
I can grant you one of three settings-light, medium or dark
Oh yeah. Lamps are going thru a real gentrification situation right now.
$5,000 is a bit much for a 2 bedroom.
No the rule is: The one thing you cannot wish for is more bread.
Wishing that I lived in the toaster was not your best option.
Sorry, as Genie of the Toaster I can only fulfill your wishes for level of darkness.
Shall I butter it too ?
I'll take it! I'd been looking to upsize for centuries.
Oh. Because with this, I get wi-fi!
It's not there.
I'm the new medical insurance genie for the Republican health plan. What symptom would you like?
For an extra wish, the Property Brothers upgraded my space. The closets are amazing.
With all my smart new friends , the lamp is passe
Hey, what can I say? The oil lamp is so yesterday. By the way, you need to clean out the crumbs in there.
Try it again. The parental controls don't allow Pop Tarts.
Well you wished for a lot of bread didn't you?
You're going to want to give that a minute.
Sorry, wrong number, rub 123 - 4567 for the coffee genie
Let go of my EGO.
Wishes? No, I just do toast. You want Dennis but he's out to lunch.
I'm sorry. Your appliance is incompatible with our Master's lifestyle.
Wishes not questions. It's 2017.
Keep rubbing that thing and you’ll be toast
Just nothing about the MTA
I thought you'd be happy for me.
I'm sorry I'm only IOS 10.3. IOS 11 is the coffee pot.
Master, Please don't request onion bagels again.
Toaster's fixed. That's one. Want me to work on the coffeemaker?
you get three wishes, but we're out of pumpernickel."
Look kid, each slice counts as a wish.
You should see how much the coffee pot charges for rent.
You'll need a power strip before making the third wish.
Love the bronze lamp. Back in the day . . .
Sorry, I was on vacation on the west toast.
Bob had always dreamed of becoming a toastmaster...
Homeland Security is cracking down on lamps.
Use that as your Neti Pot and I'll move back in."
It's not that I didn't like the lamp, but you can't beat my new place for making crostini.

Catch up son. Genies moved from static electricity to alternating current when your great grand parents were your age.
So you see, after your third wish, I'm toast..
The dry heat is better for my allergies.
"You rub the lamp & I pop up!"?
I haven't even had my coffee yet!
Sorry, I was having breakfast.
Where is my toaster strudel?
It has internet
" Burning your brothers' toast is NOT a good wish choice".
Since it's your last wish, I'd probably go a little deeper. Maybe instead of, 'toast,' you should wish for, 'buttered toast.'
My wife got everything in the divorce except for this toaster and that coffeemaker, so don't pester me with your lame 3 wishes.
We all have wishes that end us up in the toaster if we aren't careful.
Two heated bedrooms? I'll take it.
Sorry, I can't make the perfect toast for you either
I got stuck in the crumb tray.
I can also clean the coffee maker, if you wish.
You've no idea how cold it gets in that lamp!
I spend my winters there.
The heating system is better.
I don't do breakfast.
The toaster had wi-fi.
It's not exactly traditional, but you can't beat the cost of living.
I don't do Pop-Tarts, kid. Try me for stone-ground gluten-free multi-grain whole wheat.
either get me a wi-fi connection or push me back in
Don't tell me you forgot how to make toast again!
I prefer electrical heating to oil.
There is nothing wrong with the address; it was the GPS.
The GPS took me to the toaster.
It's a smart toaster
Are you wondering what happened to your english muffin?

Can I borrow a wish? I think Joe DiMaggio's still in the Mr. Coffee.

The pop up thing is much quicker and more up to date.
I disobeyed; that’s why I’m toast.
So... I found Aladdin this kitchen.
Who are you calling a pop tart?
You did wish for smart appliances
Toasted to an even doneness edge to edge? Impossible!
I said, "give me the things I want THE MOST- not to toast!
You rubbed the wrong thing, buddy!
It's crossover technology.
Well, popping out was a long time ago. I popup now.
Technically, your first wish was for toast. Whole wheat and peanut butter are extra.
Okay...so your bagels will no longer get stuck. But now wouldn't you rather have a million dollars than just "a decent cup of coffee"?
Upgrading to wireless was huge mistake.
Sorry, but I need my coffee first.
"FYI, were out of bagels"!
Master-Schmaster! I'm staying in here until you get the heat in the lamp fixed.
Hey,I'm on vacation!
It's got wi-fi

You can't ask for more slices.
People don't rub a hot surface as much.
No rubbing required! Just set it on "bagel."
I decided to winterize my home...
I'm past due for an oil change.
After your last wish backfired, you said I was toast, remember?
Why did you waste your wish on a home cooked breakfast, when you could have gone out to any fast food restaurant?
Sorry, but I'm just your're toaster's Siri update.

Anything except that the toast comes out the same way every time.
Sorry I couldn't fix your oven... But here's a toaster.
I've relocated; it's toasty in there.
Son, I just burned my ass on a hot wire. If you want avocado on your toast, you can put it there yourself.

Rent was just skyrocketing in the lamp. Want to check out the new digs?

Upgrade.
I know I am at your command. You still can't get your toast done a "7" on one side, and a "4" on the other.
Sorry, it's regime change, infidel. I'm too tech-savvy for that now.
Yeah, see, we just use the wires now. Sometimes even get a snack on the way.
Light, dark or very dark, sire?
No thanks, the toaster has wi-fi.
Can it wait until my Pop-Tart is done?
Thanks for letting me move kid - the central heating in this one is nice, but I prefer the hot tub in the other.
Technical difficulties !
Sorry lad, my hands are full trying to fix this thing
You wished the Genie to 'pop up'
They got central heating.

Decaf will cost you another wish.
You can wish all you want, but nothin's gonna happen 'cause I'm still on their 'No-Fly List'!
I'm supposed to grant you three wishes, but I'm way too toasted.
What? This is my new pop-up shop.
OK, homework, sure. Right. But first- these Pop Tarts are incredible.
...and you were expecting Pop-Tarts?
You still get the wishes, kid—the damn lamp just rubs me the wrong way.
I took a hundred shits in your toaster.
Three? That's nothing. I'll give you 4 wishes and throw in a perfectly toasted sesame bagel at no extra charge.
I hope you don't mind that I drank your coffee.
I'm just checking out some modern options to update my image. After all, that lamp IS over 2000 years old.

Eliminate cockroaches? Sorry, I do't do miracles.
We've gone electronic

Market testing shows this just works better than the lamp.
Toast or coffee would be the most easy for me.
Granted, but first, can I get a fresh pot?
More square footage, upgraded heating, and free continental breakfast. What's not to like?

Don't waste another wish. That toast just isn't coming about.
You need to upgrade. Two left.
Welcome, I am your Toastmaster today! The theme of our meeting is lamps.
Ask them to change the filter already!
I checked it, kid. There ain't no pop tart in there.
Let's try this again.
What did you expect, when you rub me the wrong way?
This one is roomy with a burnt smell I can get used to.
Sorry kid, but putting me here was your parents idea.
Next time unplug the damn toaster.
At least it's a duplex.
The sauna's okay but you need to clean the hot tub.
Do three wishes by the end of this week, or I'm toast.

The lamp is old news. I like to pop up anywhere.
As for your first wish, your new toaster will arrive within three business days. Free shipping.

No, a regular coffee and a bagel with a shmear does not count as a wish.
Your wish is granted. Your toaster will now work.
They raised the rent on me.
OK...I cleaned the inside of the toaster. What's your next wish?
Plug it in, out comes Jinn!
No, but I can make your toast bigger.
And I wish you would make some coffee.
It's not ideal but it's rent controlled
There are more amenities and the crumbs add whimsy that is simply not part of the lamp decor.
If you need me, rub the lamp, but I use the toaster to charge my phone.
Really, kid, you're gonna waste your first wish on the Pop Tart warming up faster?
Your mother wished I'd clean the toaster...
"I've looked and looked and I can't figure out why one side toasts quicker than the other. What's your next wish?

You gotta move with the times. My cousin comes out of a computer mouse...
World peace, true love, more wishes and/or unlimited Chocotastic Pop-Tarts

You're allowed one additional appliance wish.
What am I, Prince Charles? I don't do English muffins.
Thanks kid, I do take tea with my toast.
Three bagels this morning, eh? What's with the lamp?
Are you sure you want No. 3 to be artisanal toast?
I can't simply pop up out of thin air.
Just one wish. Dark roast!
I tried, but I can't make DiMaggio appear in a Mets uniform.
I am the genie of the toaster. You now can select to toast either a Croissant, Beignet or Bagel.
Give back my lamp or you'll be toast.
If you empty the crumb tray, I'll give you an extra wish.
Ask quickly, I need to go back tanning.
All I was saying was I thought you could make a better wish than that.
White,Wheat or Sourdough?
I can help you with the toaster, Chief, but the coffee maker's a different genie.
coffee genie is here at your service
Try unplugging the coffee maker this time!
Hey, your bagel's ready
I moved in to a duplex.
Darin, you really are old school with this whole lamp rubbing thing.
White, whole wheat, pumpernickel, a lighter rye, perhaps, or sourdough?
I'm sorry son, you need an electrician not a geni.
Yes, light, dark, or bagel setting?
I'll trade you one more wish for the toaster.
OK, the element is fixed. You have two left.
Okay, now do you think I'm hot?
The toaster is rent controlled the lamp was not.
Butter and syrup? That's all you want?
The last wish I granted was, "you're toast."
I went from your antique lamp to this old automatic drip brewer but then one morning I "woke up and smelled the coffee".
That kid that was bullying you at school? He's toast!
Wish again, the "perfect toaster" doesn't exist.
Ya get three wishes, Shorty, but make it snappy, my butt's on fire.
It's not worth fixing. Get a new one.
You going uptown?
What?! I was ready for something more modern?
I've updated with technology! I need to be charged!
I was in the fridge 'till they hiked the rent.
If you wish for me to cool off in the fridge, you will still have two more wishes.
Based on appearances, your toast is in that bottle.
Master, you have three wishes to chose from: light toast, dark toast, or coffee.
I only serve Toastmasters; to find another genie, unplug the toaster.
No thanks, I'm a beer man myself.
What are you, an old man? It's all automatic now...
I'm not ready to downsize to the lamp.
Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. Still figuring out this new hybrid technology.
You see, MY wish was to be the toast of the town.
It's simple, I'm adjusting for climate change.
I didn't think you would mind since we went Solar.
For an eternity there I thought I was toast!
OK, here's your toaster. One wish left...
Didn't they offer you a service contract on the lamp?
I'm just a variation of a "ghost in the machine".
No no no, you want the other guy.
We've upgraded.
The lamp? I think not! You have your wishes; I have mine. I'm thinking an espresso machine would be nice.
Where's the butter? The toast is done.
I have to go back for the bread
You want all those crumbs cleared out? What am I, a magician?
Magic lantern? I wish! And you should see how the Genies in Economy Coach have to travel!
That was your third wish. I'm toast.
Your wish is my command: poppy seeds or everything?
You better wish to get that tea out of my lamp.
When they said I'd be the "Toast of the Town" I was going in a whole different direction!
Lose the genie bottle. I'm moving in with Alexa.
But you cannot ask for even colored toast
Look, everyone's got a side gig these days.
I will grant you three dishes.
You set it on "dark". What did you expect?
Give me another. Once the pop-tart breaks, there's really nothing you can do.
Instead of rubbing the lamp, you push the toast lever. We've switched to solar.
I wanted a bagel.
Lamps are so 2400 BC.
You're out of coffee and I'm from Sumatra. We got a deal?
This new one has wifi.
Listen, son, you can rub that lamp if you want but genies have moved on from low-tech.
This always happens when you use the toaster and coffee maker at the same time.
Yes master. White, wheat or rye?
If you tell this guy to Lego my Eggo, I'll give you an extra wish.
This is really just bling bling
Yeah, well Kid.....I wish I had a better way to get some bread myself.....
I'm Gene from Appliances- can I help you?
Ok if I crash in the toaster for a few days? I don't know who the last genie was, but he left the lamp a total mess.
I will grant you three wishes as long as the final one is to make that lamp my new home.
I suppose you want a juicer for your third wish.
Hey kid, I wish that you'd unplug these appliances when you're not using them.
Ok kid, I'll take it but on wishes we're down to Reheat Defrost and Bagel.
With everyone going gluten-free, I figured I'd be safer in here.
No, this is way better. The most difficult wish I've had to deal with so far is not burning Jerry in Accounting's pop tart.
I traded up.
Lamps are so old turban.
I personally enjoy the smell of toast more.
No can do- I've been gluten free for a million years.
Sorry, for gluten free try the deli across the street.
Sorry kid. You get to decide only on what type of toast. Your mom says that's magic enough.
Are you sure you want to waste a wish on a toaster-waffle?
But the toaster has WiFi.
Not now, kid, I'm doing Dim Sum with Mr Coffee. Ok, we're gay. It's 2017, you know.
Does FEMA say it's ok to come back now?
Sorry Pop Tarts are not an option.
didn't you ever wonder why you're not allowed to put bagels in there? it isn't because they don't fit.
Master! Using all my powers, I have created for you a toaster and a coffee maker. What is your third wish?
Where did you go? It gets hot as hell in there.
You still believe global warming isn't man made?
Sorry, I thought you knew this is where I winter.
I am here to grant you three dishes.
Not a chance. My place has central heat and it's close to a Starbucks.
That's passé. We're more scientific now.
I miss living alone. My new roommates are a bunch of squares.
Sorry but I had to charge my phone.
Pop-up genie, at your service, tips appreciated.
Who wished for sesame toast?
Three wishes and all you want is a good cup of coffee?!
I took care of that other guy. He's toast.
This is nothing, the Genie next door can print a 3D picture of Barbara Eden on HIS toast.
Can't help ya kid, just signed a new lease.
That's just a teapot. Try rubbing the 'Mr. Coffee'.
You wished for a breakfast cook.
I'll give you an extra wish if you clean out that toaster!
Jiffy Pop Corn and I don't care if it's a toaster.
Thanks kid. I've been stuck on the bagel setting for 2000 years.
Forget the lamp, next time you need me rub the toaster.
Well, the wi-fi can be spotty but heat's included in the rent.
O.K. final wish: The million dollars, or a blender?
First of all, I wished it for myself. And that's not what I meant by toasted.
You have three choices: light, medium, or dark.
I moved to a two bedroom with heat included.
That's all well and good, but how about my toast?
Where did you think I'd come from, the coffee pot. Get with the program kid, that Genie in the lamp is getting old.
They modernized the workforce.
Siri gave me the wrong directions!
For this last wish, make sure the bagels are from New York.
The lamp is no good, you gotta use facial recognition from now on.
1 in 5 genies had their home uprooted by Hurricane Joe, donate your vessel to help genies in need.
Back in the lantern? My mistake. I'll give you one more.
Perfect timing with the lamp. My lease is up.
I shall grant you three toasts.
My apologies, Master. I am making pizza.
Mom won't find you here... She's on keto.
Thankfully I popped, last week I dripped.
Tell your mother to stop burning the toast!!
Can you hear me NOW?
No. Single slice only.
The rent went up on the lamp, so I'm subleasing in the toaster.
Don't bother me, kid. I'm at my winter home.
My kid is moving back in after college, I just thought that there would be more privacy than in that old one room lamp. This even has heat control AND a working lift?
You must be the new guy.
Look, kid, you can rub that thing all you want--I'm still the genie of breakfast appliances.
Sorry, it's a two slice toaster. You have just one more.
Sorry, I went to the loo.
I am the Genie of the Toast, Master.
I'll grant you three bagels.
Would you like butter or cream with your final wish?
I already gave three wishes, low, medium or high..
This is nothing. Abdul, the Hiphite, was cursed with a Port-O-Let,
The secret origin of toaster strudel.
OK, I got the crumbs. You get two more.
No, you get nothing. Now, stop your toast from burning the house down, fix me a latte, and knock off the LSD.
You need to turn up the thermostat.
I know if I don't produce I am toast
made in china ! baba
Because Poptarts.
Thanks for not rubbing one out in the bathroom!
Sorry I'm late. I was just on a quick spa break.
Listen, Byron, Get the coffee on and unplug this toaster before my ass is ash!
If you want a dirt bike, tell Mommy to stop putting decaf in the coffeemaker. Or get a job and buy it yourself.
The heating unit makes the extra rent worth it!
The last guy really liked the lamp.
I know you wanted a lifetime supply of PopTarts, but your brother Kenny heats his socks in here, so, I will give you a do-over.
Did you want avocado on that?
We should upgrade to a Keurig.
You should check out my Facebook page.
Sorry, I don't have the power to impeach.
I needed a place to stay while I redecorate.
sorry, I don't do bagels
I'll grant your wish this time, but with interconnectivity no one uses lamps anymore.
Did you save the receipt?
One time travel wish was all you needed: coffee is brewed, dishes are cleaned, and this jack-in-box makes breakfast.
I just pop-up at breakfast time and your culinary wish is my command.
Coffee, tea, or toast? We're starting to set limits on wishes.
Thanks, I'm tired of eating Pop-Tarts...
I hope you don't mind if I pop in. My lamp is toast.
Electrical, $175 an hour; plumbing $250. Not included in the wishes. You want I should continue, or what?
She got the lamp in the divorce. I'm staying with some friends - gotta be out by breakfast
I was working on my tan!
Magic lamps are so passe.
This living space is much more comfy and toasty
Well it was either that or the Mr. Coffee.
I'm sorry, we are out of bagels.
You can grant you three wishes, but one will be slightly burnt.
Most kids ask for a smart phone and a car. What's your last wish?
Well, generally, yes it's, "Rub the lamp, out I come", but I move to a warmer climate for three months every year.
What is it? I was talking to the coffee pot.
L'eggo my lampo.
Quit your whining, kid. Your three choices are: wheat, white or rye.
I've relocated, now how may I help you?
Do you know where they keep the filters?
You can't summon me. I just pop in from time to time.
I shall grant you any three 'Pop Tarts' that you desire.
It’s a dry heat
Dude there are still Sez a Me bagels seeds inside there that you need to clean.
You called me from the depths of oblivion just to press a button on the coffee machine?
How about you wish for a place that makes a decent bagel?
First, let me thank you for adjusting to light setting.
I needed a place with a heater
I can rent out the other side.
Sure, there are crumbs, but at least I can charge my iPhone.
I'm going to up it to four wishes. That gluten was killing me.
You got three choices for your wish kid - You can choose light, medium, or dark
You should have seen me come out of the coffee pot last time, I was all wet.
Just so we're clear, you rub me the wrong way again and your're toast.
That's what happens when you rub me the wrong way.
Look kid, you tell your Dad to stop rewiring the house and then we can talk about your 3 wishes!

If you use this to make tea, you're toast.
I am Genie from the Universe of Things. You are granted three small-appliance wishes.
I am genie 2.0 and I come with a Wifi connection.
Kid, I'm a magical genie and you want your toaster fixed...
If you saw the genie in the coffee maker, you'd understand the move, bro.
Very good. Now you're ready to learn toast.
It's not my place, but if I were you I'd wish for a better breakfast.
The lamp isn't heated.
This is your last wish! I've popped and I'm tart. Can you be more specific?
The good news is I can fix it. The bad news is it'll cost you all 3.
You obviously didn't get the Genie upgrade notice.
So... Rubbed the coffee pot again?
I'm a Dreamer and have to leave your lamp.
So whole wheat, pumpernickel, and rye?
I thought the magic lamp thing had gotten a little cliche.
Are you kidding me?! Your Mother doesn't know how to make toast either?!
After two kitchen appliances, your final wish is not my command. Think beyond breakfast.
You were expecting toast?" It's coffee, tea or me!
Sorry, if it's not light or dark, I can't help you.
I'm living here now. Just can't give up the carbs.
Your wish is granted. No more crumbs at the bottom of the toaster.

We are no longer dependent on foreign oil.
Maybe use your last wish to bring your parents back together instead?
This one is only comes with two wishes.
No way dude. This coffee maker's worth three of those tea pots.
Can you please give me that back so I can go home.
I'm toast. You have to rub countrclockwise for Java
It's much warmer in there
Don't set it on bagel again!
OK kid...my warranty is almost up...try rubbing the coffee maker for a while.
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?!!!! It gets cold in there...
I told you not to rub the toaster!
It is true that regular Genies offer 3 wishes, but Toast Genie only has 2 slots.
You got your tea. Now what's your second wish?
It great for my arthritis, Iam not getting any younger.
I needed a change of scenery.
Could'a been a Keurig...
And I wish you'd let me finish breakfast.
Never forget that no two states under the same constraints but with different internal energies can be connected by a reversible adiabatic path.
This way, I can rent out the other side.
Are you trying to kill me, or what?
I like that it's a two bedroom, but what happens when it's plugged in?
Sorry,the coffee genie was taken.
Least you can do is make me some coffee.
Yes a touchscreen would use up your only wish.
No,Ben, now I'm constantly plugged in.
The only wish I can grant is that your toast doesn't get burned.
I wish you'd make some coffee.
Toast, coffee, and one last wish.
Sorry, the flying carpet is toast.

Amazon priced me out of the lamp. I live here now.
Tell Eugene in bio-science not to take every procedure so literally.
Oh, but Master, lanterns are so passé.
The kitchen appliances are all spotless now, young sahib. As a member in good standing of the genie guild it is my duty to suggest that you broaden the scope of your next wish beyond today's chores.
The toaster was imported. Should I be concerned about my immigration status?
You have a marvelous little gadget, but it has connectivity issues.
Feed the world with a two slice Quisinart? Master, please give the lamp to your mother.
Actually this is my girlfriend's place
Alexa has the day off.
That's not my ride anymore.
Hey, it’s the 21st century. Everyone has to multitask to stay relevant.
I'm not a tart.
I'm done with the lamp. Next time you want a wish, jiggle the toaster thingy.
No wishes today, I'm not bread for this.
It's call the enchantment of things.
I needed a duplex.
I got a heated office with the corporate merger.

White, rye, or whole wheat?
It wasn't plugged in. Okay, you've got one more.
Sorry dude, that bagel is really stuck!
I thought you wished for me to help you stop rubbing it so much.
I suggest you wish the crumbs away from the bottom of the toaster.
With coffee . . . most people go with the combo . . . slice of sourdough, slice of rye.
I know..., I should have wished for a bigger place. Central Heating is quite overrated.
My tea please.
It's how I warm up for really big wishes.
TOAST!#?
But at least it's a dry heat.
Sorry, he moved to Tampa a couple weeks ago.
I can't stand that Earl Grey you've been drinking!
I just got a hot tip for you.
I'm an office genie... nobody cares, just so long as I don't appear as burnt microwave popcorn.
Too late to save the toast, Master
Oh good. You found the lamp. It was getting hot in there.
So, if you desire hot coffee or anything else, just say, "OPEN-faced, toasted muffin SESAME."
I wish I could help, but I don't do beverages.
You said, "I wish I had a Pop Tart," so there's one in the toaster. Now give me my lamp back.
It's so toasty in here next to that. You mind?
Okay, your math teacher is toast.
Sorry, sorry, I was looking for a bit more space.

Ummm yeah, can we turn that coffee pot into a nice espresso machine?
You didn't specify the form of dough
There's warmth and food in here.
And you're sure that sesame bagel will be gone by the time I move in?
The last guy wished for a pastrami sandwich on toasted genie
Are you sure? Your mom is right.. Pop Tarts really aren't the best way to start your day.
You have one wish, not including toast or additional wishes. And what are you doing withy mother?
Times change kid. Blame the EPA.
Leave me alone! I'm on vacation!
Would you believe it's also Wi-Fi enabled?
Alright, I'm the slave only to who ever rubbed the toaster.
I would've come out sooner, but I was stuck under a piece of burnt waffle.
Your lamp is toast, buddy.
Sorry, I know you asked for a Blender
I've set the dial to wish number three.
Roomier, extra slot for guests, more carbon friendly.
Those Arabian nights can get cold.
I'll grant you three wishes if you'll get the wiring in this place checked!
These days there's wish lists all over the damn internet. I'm toast.
Apologies, Master. Just catching some rays.
"Now that you've switched to Arabian coffee ...".
Three wishes?You can't even get three slices of toast in this place.
Do you know how hard it is to find a heater repairman who specializes in ninth century lamps to come out on a Sunday?

So, what's your wish, coffee or toast
If you weren't so cheap and turn on the heat I move back into my bottle!
I'm too old for this job now, kid. I'm toast.
I wish you'd just understand.
Sorry, your mom said only decaf.
Did you say "Sesame or blueberry"?
The butter dish is over there
Can I get a fresh pot?
Just use the App!
I think I'll try the coffee pot. The toaster is really crummy.
You got Genie in the toaster. Be careful what you wish for.
Being the Diaper Genie, I didn't get out as much!
Sorry I'm late, but I was looking for the toaster oven.
Darker or lighter? Your wish is my command!
Sorry to disappoint, but I'm toast
I used to come out of there until your mom switched to drip. Then it just wasn't full-bodied enough.
The least you could do for me is have the coffee brewed!
I'm sorry, we no longer provide driver-less magic carpets. Uber has that market now.
Never mind. It seems to be working now.
'I am good, but I am not Starbucks.'
An extra 12 square inches, AND heat that works. It's a big step up
I am glad you finally found me that was a little toasty for my liking. Now it is your turn to go and hide.
I prefer my Tetley toasted.
Genie Airbnb. $40 a night, isn't that wild?
As per union rules, I get a snack break after every 2 wishes.
It's warmer in there.
Let me introduce myself, I am Crusty.
But this one's got radiant heating... that lamp is cold.
Place it next to the coffee maker and my work here is done.
Yes, but this one has cinnamon-raisin bagels.
So, you dream of genie with the light brown toast. I will grant you three pieces but if you want the crust cut off, you have to do that yourself.
The lamp wasn't toasty enough for my liking.
Yes, I am Alexa, and I am everywhere.
I just followed the GPS.
Wheat, pumpernickel or rye?
Can I move in? I'm feeling a little out of my element here.
Okay, you've now got a standing desk and a dedicated parking space--what was the third wish again?
Do you think you could grab me some sunscreen?
My new place has central heating.
So what that I have a second job fixing appliances?
I can grant you three wishes as long as they involve Pop-Tarts.
I think I'm caught on half a bagel.
sorry kid that section of America’s Last Remaining Video Rental Store is 18 and up. unless... maybe i could let you take a look... if you give me that lamp?
It was getting chilly in the lamp.
'Genie in a bottle' really paved the way for new venues.
Get that thing out of here! The toaster is much roomier.
I will grant you three wishes, but they all must have to do with toast.
I saved so much on heat, you get FOUR wishes.
Your desired Pop Tarts will be ready in a jif
You eating that last Pop-Tart?

Think of it as a Prius.
Lamps are so yesterday.
My only wish is that you don't make decaf.
I'm old school internet of things
but these appliances are Internet connected.
Sorry, but I ate your Eggo..
Well, don't you have any wishes specifically about toast?
How else do you think bread becomes toast?
I'm tired of you rubbing me up in the morning. I'd rather just pop up with a cup of coffee.
It's a time share.
That thing rubs me the wrong way.
Amazon proved me out of the lamp. This is where I live now.
Can you tell your parents I like medium roast?
Firstly, that is not a teapot. Secondly, your call, but perhaps just wait for your bread to toast and save a wish.
The wife and I needed two bedrooms.
Next time rub the kettle
Can you give me about 20 minutes? I was just finishing my breakfast.
The genie lamp is sooo last millennium
Sure it's hot in there but at least it's got a sunroof
Hey,I'm on vacation!
It just seems such a waste, squandering all three wishes on Pop-Tarts.
I am not going back! The toaster is warm and cozy.
I don't care how Super your Bowl will be. I am not getting in that lamp and going to Minnesota in February! I'll stay here where it is toasty warm.
Take the bagels and lox. Forget the coffee and take the cream cheese.
You weren't talking to me when you said "you're toast?"
Sorry kid. I nolonger live in a lamp.
Not bad, but I prefer the Uber.
No, I don't think that "let go of my Eggo" counts as a wish.
No, I'm not a genie, I'm the warranty. Your parents think that's better than magic.
Look kid, "Espresso Patronum" gets you this.
Yeah, it's been tough getting my bearings since G.E. sold off it's appliance division.
The last person who rubbed that lamp told me to get toasted.
No, you said "if you can't grant my 3rd wish, you're toast."
Your Pop-Tart is my command.
I am not your burnt toast nor a ghost, What I tell you is true, not a boast.  I can change that teapot  To a plane or a yacht. Now you tell me which one you want most.
Sorry, I can't help you. You'll need wit, not wishes, to win the caption contest.
It's like a sauna in there.
The other choice was a bottle with a stopper!
Sorry, but if you read the fine print of your lamp agreement, you'll see that we only accept toast related wishes.
That's a crummy place to live.
I can grant you one wish: coffee, tea or wheat.
``It's spacious. The heating is excellent. And the HOA fee is reasonable. But sorry, I'm a bottle guy.''
Ten years schvitzing inside this Magic Toaster and you are the first person who rubbed it! You still get all three wishes from that stupid lamp.
I thought you said, "I wish for some bread."
Sorry, I was out on a coffee break.
Sorry, got lost in the toast.
Rub it again and I'll grind you up with the coffee.
Look kid, you don't wish on toast but while I'm here, how do you want it?
Yes, your sesame bagel is now open.
Now before we get started, I need to warm up a bit.
You are granted three toppings.
Third wish has gotta be I get back in the lamp kid, or I'm toast.
You were expecting the Pillsbury Doughboy?
No, I'm NOT bringing back that health care bill again so forget it.
This is my summer house.
I know you said it would get toasty in here, but this is ridiculous
Give me a few minutes kid - I'm working on my tan.
No can do. Try the genie of the food processor.
Tune in, turn on, pop out!
I'm staying with the kitchen appliances until you get a REAL neti pot.
Look, I'll grant you the wishes, but you're still responsible for the heat in this dump.
You found it in the nick of time! The breakfast rush is about to start.
OK, one toasted bagel with a schmear.
I only grant wishes relating to small appliances.
It's been quite a while. I've upgraded to a warmer climate!
I only grant one wish - light or dark?
Just serve biscotti.
It was the wiring, it's working fine now---- got to go----- clients are waiting!
What? It's a great tanning booth! I'm laying down a base tan for my trip to Tahiti!
You get your toaster back when you give me that silver teapot.
I get more hits this way
Ghost?" I thought you said "toast.
Hey, clean the damn coffee pot
Look, kid, I wish I could get all the crumbs out of my toaster too.
I want back in the lamp. This toaster makes a crummy home.
It's just for the winter!
Can you turn my toast into pizza?
Personally it feels like a waste of a wish to me, but okay all the crumbs are gone.
I moved to a place with central heating
I rent that out on Airbnb and was able to afford this and the coffee maker.
What's with the carafe with the leaky roof?
OK, 'an open sesame bagel, toasted. Hold the butter.'
Wow, these gadgets are freakin' magic!
Yes, it has 'potential'––IF I put some bread into it.
Where did you find my childhood home?
it's easier this way.
I couldn't get back in the bottle.
Yeah, but heat was included.
Way to think outside of the box...
Don't believe everything you see on TV, kid.
I can't stand the heat so I'm getting out of the kitchen.
That's where I winter.
I pretty much do pro bono work since Amazon got in the game.
Your toast is toast.
