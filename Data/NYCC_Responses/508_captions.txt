Do YOU remember what you had for lunch last Thursday?
I suppose now you plan to grill me.
I'm not sure. What does the other leg look like?
I prefer the term 'high interest lender.'
Yeah, maybe I did. Like I said, I eat a lot of people.
So then this guy said, 'Hey, you want a piece of me?'
I'll be representing myself.
Would you wave it around a bit?
One hit movie 40 years ago and we're all murderers
Go ahead waterboard me
It was a feeding frenzy--who remembers faces?
No offense, but you all look the same to me.
I'm in the catch and release program
I know when I'm being baited.
Sure, I remember him. He tasted like chicken.
I eat guys like you for breakfast.
I want a maritime lawyer.
A little closer please.
Last time I heard, he was in the can.
Well, they should have had a bigger boat.
I knew this would come back to bite me.
Can we make this quick? I gotta keep moving.
It's not my fault! He was in my home and wearing a mask.
In my effort to find locally sourced food, I made an error in judgment..
Catch and release. Are you kidding?
That could be me, but like I said, Shark Week is all kind of a big blur.
All I can tell you is he tasted like chicken.
It was in international waters
Can we go back to water boarding?
