5285,2806,2,18,80,100,1.22,0.046231739501923746,679,Do you mean that there is no fresh salmon available today?

I'll definitely have the salmon again tonight... absolutely the freshest in town... but this time, could you please try to keep the teeth marks to a minimum."
4681,2806,5,12,83,100,1.22,0.05237780391954538,679,It's not my fault that global warming ended your hibernation early.
2862,2806,3,16,81,100,1.22,0.048367281703584904,679,So the catch of the day is salmon?

3019,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,My home's melting and you're ordering dinner? What're you thinking???
3036,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,"I'll have your ecosystem, thank you."
3041,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,"Can I just say, I bugs me when waiters don't write down orders, and drip."
3071,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,How do you know the wild salmon is fresh-caught?
3085,3359,3,12,75,90,1.2,0.05046599329648382,679,"OK, if the wild caught salmon isn't available. . ."
3097,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,"Well if you can't catch a salmon, do you recommend the household trash or the grub platter?"
3179,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,Hmmm... what do YOU think is better... the steak or the fish?
3184,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,I thought employees just washed their hands in the woods.
3895,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,I think I'll have the fresh salmon.
3246,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,That's the last umbrella I buy from a bodega.
2907,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,Bring me a dry martini.
3946,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,This is refreshing. My last date was a dry shrew.
4174,3359,3,12,75,90,1.2,0.05046599329648382,679,How's the bear soup?
3999,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,Ok.   I'll have the fresh salmon.
4881,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,How’s the iceberg lettuce today?
4902,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,The brook trout. Very dry.
4903,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,I'll take your word that the salmon is fresh caught.
4966,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,"I’ve changed my mind. I’ll have steak, not salmon."
5015,3359,4,10,76,90,1.2,0.0528819853025402,679,Bear with me while I evaluate the options.
5038,3359,3,12,75,90,1.2,0.05046599329648382,679,And you're certain the salmon is freshly wild-caught?
5055,3359,3,12,75,90,1.2,0.05046599329648382,679,How fresh is the day's catch?
5076,3359,0,18,72,90,1.2,0.04239991520025441,679,I take it you're out of the salmon?
5102,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,"Well, never mind the gluten-free salmon. I'll just have a salad to go."
5114,3359,3,12,75,90,1.2,0.05046599329648382,679,"Rain or shine, I wasn't going to hold up dinner waiting for you to finish yet another hibernation!"
5125,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,I take it there's no Catch of the Day?
5241,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,"I assume the salmon is really fresh, right?"
5323,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,"Well, at least you knew enough."
5337,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,OK; I take you at your word: 'No more salmon'.
5344,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,You're sure the trout is fresh?
5364,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,"Judging by your appearance, am I to assume that tonight's salmon special  is locally sourced?"
5380,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,"I'll have the catch of the day, please."
5412,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,"Sorry, they're out of salmon here too."
5465,3359,3,12,75,90,1.2,0.05046599329648382,679,"Your late again! Please, don't give me another soggy, wet excuse."
5414,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,"Well if you're out of the salmon, then I'll have the cabernet."
2580,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,"Trigger warning, Baked Alaska is the dessert special."
5490,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,"My regrets for the confusion, but I had asked for another libation from the wet BAR...."
5496,3359,3,12,75,90,1.2,0.05046599329648382,679,I’ve changed my mind.  I don’t want the fresh salmon after all.
4866,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,Have you got any fresh salmon?
4856,3359,3,12,75,90,1.2,0.05046599329648382,679,My apologizes but salmon will not be served this evening.
4853,3359,2,15,78,95,1.2,0.04636869624047491,679,I think I'll go with the steak.
4812,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,But how can you be sure the salmon is fresh?
4032,3359,3,12,75,90,1.2,0.05046599329648382,679,I am tired of your  constant whining about global climate change!
4168,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,What do you mean you can find any fresh fish?
4179,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,You need to start taking sponge baths.
4199,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,So why did you run out of iceberg lettuce?
4225,3359,4,10,76,90,1.2,0.0528819853025402,679,"I'm sorry, I forgot I was in Kentucky. I asked my waiter if they have a wet BAR!"
4238,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,I've changed my mind.  I think I'd like the pasta instead of the salmon.
4293,3359,0,18,72,90,1.2,0.04239991520025441,679,"So the salmon is fresh, and is the venison dry aged?"
4314,3359,0,18,72,90,1.2,0.04239991520025441,679,"Well, look what the bear dragged in."
4334,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,"No, I haven't made up my mind yet.  Chill, will ya?"
4354,3359,3,12,75,90,1.2,0.05046599329648382,679,"Oh, well then, I'll have it straight up."
4382,3359,3,12,75,90,1.2,0.05046599329648382,679,"I would like a salmon, fresh from the river."
3959,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,So today's special is a nice cool Gazpacho.
4427,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,Again?
4474,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,"No, I have my wine and did not order a cold beer"
4492,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,"Sir, have you read the sign? ""No gargantuan, hirsute, ursine pets in this vicinity"
4495,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,On second thoughts I won't have the freshly caught wild salmon ...
4497,3359,3,12,75,90,1.2,0.05046599329648382,679,"I would recommend our fish Sir, it is as fresh as they get."
4522,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,Could you say I'm with you? I need to use the ...
4529,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,I don't find the special sustainable at all.
4541,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,Sorry sir we are completely out of freshly caught fish
4559,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,How about if we share the salmon fillet?
4587,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,"Yes, the wild caught salmon."
4627,3359,3,12,75,90,1.2,0.05046599329648382,679,I'm told your specialty is the baked Alaska.
4676,3359,3,12,75,90,1.2,0.05046599329648382,679,"I’m not happy about this either, my friend, but once you knock back that Beaujolais aperitif, I think you’ll really get into the chef’s hazelnut panko-crusted seal filet on a bed of light cream sauce with just a tease of habanero."
4441,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,"...mais non, garçon, il fait encore trop froid!"
2567,3359,3,12,75,90,1.2,0.05046599329648382,679,"On second thought, another cold wine will be fine."
331,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,What’s that dripping off of you—the marinade?”
2545,3359,3,12,75,90,1.2,0.05046599329648382,679,I'm really in the mood for fish sticks.
558,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,"I'll have the advertised special freshly caught salmon, please!"
589,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,I'll have the fresh caught fish.
601,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,So your iceberg melted? Deal with it.
622,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,"Get off my case.  If I want a steak, I’ll have a steak."
629,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,"As the fresh salmon did not work out, the honey crusted veggies and roots will be splendid."
649,3359,0,18,72,90,1.2,0.04239991520025441,679,Did any champagne make it in the glass?
653,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,"I never told the maître d, ""Bear with me""."
668,3359,3,12,75,90,1.2,0.05046599329648382,679,"Sorry, you're in my seat"
704,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,Could you bring me a fresh Salmon for Dinner?
738,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,I'll have the Not-So-Artic Char
745,3359,3,12,75,90,1.2,0.05046599329648382,679,"Sorry, somebody just snagged the last salmon."
810,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,"Oh really?  Well tell me, exactly how fresh is this fish of yours?"
883,3359,3,12,75,90,1.2,0.05046599329648382,679,"I'll have the Arctic Char with Grilled Iceberg Lett... on second thought, I'll just look at the dessert menu."
904,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,Tell me about your Rainforest Basket.
910,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,"Do you recommend the ""Global Warming Special""?"
918,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,"Can you assure me that the salmon is fresh?"""
947,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,I suppose you’ll want me to pay for the dry cleaning.
964,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,"Sorry, no iceberg lettuce."
966,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,You've convinced me. I'll try the Fresh Polar Ice Cap Special.
976,3359,3,12,75,90,1.2,0.05046599329648382,679,"...Had you followed Smokey the Bears' guidelines the sprinklers wouldn't have activated, right?"
991,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,No!  I ordered BAKED Alaska!
1037,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,What do you have that's smoky?
1064,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,"The wild salmon is, I take it, freshly caught?"
549,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,Are you sure the trout is wild-caught?
1067,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,Do you have anything besides the freshly caught salmon?
530,3359,4,10,76,90,1.2,0.0528819853025402,679,"I'm sorry, did you say you caught the salmon yourself?"
524,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,"I’ll have the salmon, unless it’s on the endangered list as well."
722,3359,2,16,82,100,1.2,0.044946657497549475,679,"So, you're out of the salmon?"
542,3359,2,15,78,95,1.2,0.04636869624047491,679,"Well, I hope you'll bear with me, I have a great explanation"
1536,3359,3,13,79,95,1.2,0.04872391770757884,679,"Is the ""baked Alaska"" still available?"
1965,3359,4,11,80,95,1.2,0.0509704259596523,679,"All right, all right. Make it a veggie burger then."
17,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,"I’ll have the wild caught salmon, please."
70,3359,0,18,72,90,1.2,0.04239991520025441,679,"If I wanted to hear about the melting ice caps, I would watch Greta Thunberg on youtube."
93,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,"I can ""bearly"" refuse the fresh salmon."
117,3359,3,12,75,90,1.2,0.05046599329648382,679,You say the salmon comes from where?
146,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,Sir did you not request a quiet table with a view of the water?
181,3359,5,8,77,90,1.2,0.055192320658542765,679,I'll start of with a canister of Pepper-Spray.
185,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,"Well, if you can't get the salmon..."
243,3359,3,12,75,90,1.2,0.05046599329648382,679,I'll have the salmon melt.
255,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,So does this mean no more wedge salad?
275,3359,5,8,77,90,1.2,0.055192320658542765,679,I hear your salmon catch is very fresh.
297,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,How much for a salmon tartare?
332,3359,3,12,75,90,1.2,0.05046599329648382,679,You're sure the salmon is fresh?
336,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,So where's my trout
343,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,"OK, you've found me. This is about fish, isn't it?"
376,3359,4,10,76,90,1.2,0.0528819853025402,679,"If you really are out of salmon, then I will have the halibut.  Could you put a fresh huckleberry sauce on the side?"
399,3359,2,14,74,90,1.2,0.04792836935744237,679,We're out of fish.
402,3359,4,10,76,90,1.2,0.0528819853025402,679,"On second thought, forget the salmon"
406,3359,3,12,75,90,1.2,0.05046599329648382,679,I'll have the farm-raised salmon.
491,3359,3,12,75,90,1.2,0.05046599329648382,679,"I'll have the garlic salmon, the salmon vegetable medley and a slice of the salmon cheesecake."
528,3359,1,16,73,90,1.2,0.045248654113974406,679,Are you SURE the daily catch is fresh?
