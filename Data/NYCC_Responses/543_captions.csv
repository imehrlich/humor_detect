I really just thought they would send me a lapel pin when I registered.
If he farts I'm out of here.
Well, at least the 800-lb gorilla finally left.
I see it. Don't change the subject.
We're seeing the end of the Republican party.
The zoo won't pay the ransom. Now what?
Face it: 'Ms. Bigly' refuses to go with you to the Trump rally today!
It looked smaller online.
Why can't you just wear a button, like most people?
Well SOMEONE clogged the toilet.
...and we also have to do something about the bull in the china closet.
When you said "a large memory device" I thought you meant a hard drive.
It's your metaphor. You feed it!
I think we're gonna need a bigger pee pad.
Well he's ignoring us too, Sylvia!
It's hiding from the Republican Party.
If his memory is so good, why can't he remember that he lives in 12B and not 12C?
A homing elephant? A "HOMING" elephant? Well, genius, now we're gonna have TWO elephants in the room !!!!
Well, at least HE remembers our anniversary.
I can't wait until those Petersons downstairs crank their stereo again.
No, Steve, this isn't just about who empties her litter box.
You voted for him, you clean up after him
Are we speaking metaphorically?
Great, now I’m living with two Dumbos.
I would have preferred a bumper sticker.
That reminds me, your mother called.
At least, for once, you're using the word "literally" correctly!
Isn't it enough to just tell our friends we're Republicans?
We had a hellava lot more room when he was just a metaphor.
No darling, I said I wanted something elegant for my birthday...
You're right. With Trump we really are seeing a different side of the Republican Party.
We're gonna need a bigger newspaper.
No, there's nothing I'd like to discuss.
Let's hope he doesn't move any further to the right.
Large Mammal - 8 letters
I liked him better as a rhetorical device.
He just needs a place to hide until after the election.
Just list it as 'Low mileage, exotic leather seating, ivory handles, huge trunk space…oh, and costs peanuts.'
What elephant?
You gave how much to the campaign?
"Come and visit," you said. Did you think he wouldn't remember?
Ironically, he's ignoring us.
Why couldn’t you wear a campaign button like everybody else!
You know, we've been ignoring this for so long that I can't even remember what it represents.
It sure doesn’t smell like a metaphor.
A bumper sticker wasn't good enough for you??
Don't tell me what I can and can't ignore!
We don't have to talk about it. I just want to know how it got through the door.
I think I preferred the 800-pound gorilla.
What elephant?
What elephant?
It could be worse - the Petersons just joined Save the Whales.
Last chance, Frank. Does this make my butt look smaller?
The real problem is, that's not the biggest ass in the living room.
Actually, it's all we ever talk about.
Honey, be careful what you say. He'll remember everything.
He’s awfully smelly for a metaphor.
Whatever you do, keep that mouse in your pocket.
He's cute, you said! How big can he get, you said!
It's not his daily intake I'm worried about!
No, I said I wanted something "elegant" for my birthday.
Free shipping.
Not to alarm you, but today I saw an M - O - U - S - E.
Okay, but can you at least acknowledge that it's there?
We would have so much more room if we voted Democrat.
We need a bigger apartment or a smaller metaphor.
What elephant?
What elephant?
Then what do you suggest we do talk about?
What elephant?
What elephant?
What elephant?
We also need to talk about the giraffe in the kitchen.
This is the last time I'm doing AirBnB.
I much preferred the monkey on our back.
He can stay as long as he doesn't start leaning right.
What elephant?
Which reminds me, your mother called.
What elephant?
Next time play poker for money.
I walked him last. He remembers.
You haven't mentioned the new rug.
He's just hiding here until the election is over.
He says the party's changed. Says he doesn't feel welcome there anymore.
So are we going to discuss the dull, middle-aged couple in the room?
She says Donald groped her too.
You know what's really rigged? The caption contest.
Sometimes an elephant is just an elephant.
Of course I'm sure I told the decorator 'elegant'!
What room?
Do you ever miss the fly on the wall?
I think he makes my hips look smaller
What elephant?
What elephant?
We received another death threat from the nice couple directly below us.
I preferred the monkey on our backs.
You're going to need a bigger newspaper.
It's callous, but there are days when I wish he'd run away and join the circus.
No, I put the 800-pound gorilla in the dining room.
When you're finished reading the paper spread it on the floor.
His party abandoned him.
ANIMALS ESCAPE METAPHORICAL ZOO. Bull recovered from China Shop, Elephant remains at large.
Your turn to change the litter box.
What elephant?
Am I misusing "literally" this time?
Can we talk about the giraffe in the hallway?
I said I'd let him hide here till after the election.
Yeah, I know it’s just a metaphor, but it really stinks.
I preferred the 800-pound gorilla.
What elephant?
Even if you think it will make America great again, whose gonna clean up the mess?
You're not going to say anything about my new haircut?
You never notice the changes I make around here.
We got a letter from the condo board.
Your metaphor stinks.
We have to pick a smaller metaphor.
What elephant?
I think we'll need more newspaper than that.
Honestly, I preferred the 800 pound gorilla.
The zoo called. It wants your metaphor back.
I think it's time to talk about the couple in the room.
What elephant?
But doesn't it seem weird to you that SHE'S the one ignoring US?
When I ordered the extra memory, this wasn't what I had in mind.
Patience. After the election it should go away.
Tom, I said we should make this room more ELEGANT.
What elephant?
John,are we living with a metaphor or with a cliché?
So what were your other two wishes ?
We need to talk about how much you've donated to the G.O.P.
What elephant?
George, he wants to go outside.
You voted him in. Deal with it.
Guess which two of us remembered my birthday?
No, let's discuss your drinking.
I got it for peanuts.
What elephant?
The shelter said it's a Labrador mix.
I forget . . . are we flattening the rug or holding up the ceiling?
Next time when "Save the Circus Elephants" calls, let me answer the phone.
We need to talk about the giraffe in the study.
Don't mention Hillary. It gives him gas.
Well, the cliché is about to shit on the rug.
We need a place with more trunk space.
What elephant?
He was "fired" as mascot. Trump and his followers claim he was born in Kenya.
I refuse to discuss the elephant in the room, with the elephant in in the room.
I can't believe you finally noticed. Yes, Harold, that is an LED light bulb.
The difference is that the 800 pound gorilla is a figure of speech.
He's lying low 'til Trump loses.
I wasn't going to mention it, but I've always hated this lamp.
He's a rescue.
Well, then YOU clean up after the metaphor next time!
Honey, put down the newspaper. And we're gonna need yesterday's too.
No, it's actually all we ever talk about.
What elephant?
What! Two bumper stickers and a lawn sign aren't enough?
Oh, thank God! When you said "big, loud, associated with Republicans and stinks," I thought you were bringing Donald home for dinner!
You never want to talk about him.
Mind if I crack a window?
Be Patient. It will disappear on November 8.
Why is he ignoring the people in the room?
Whose butt is bigger?Be honest.
At least HE won't forget our anniversary.
Now you want to talk about it!
Geez, Richard, to think there could be a bigger ass than you in this room.
He's just not the party animal he used to be.
Fine, what do you want to talk about?
I'm torn. I like what he stands for, but he was born in Kenya.
What elephant?
What elephant?
What elephant?
He's now whining that this Cartoon Caption Contest is rigged too.
I said this place needed more ELEGANCE.
What metaphor?
Paint it white, and we'll sell it on Saturday.
When you said you were entertaining the biggest republican ass in town, I thought you meant....
Trump said she was too fat to represent the GOP.
No, he's the one who's pretending we're not here.
You haven't said a thing about the new rug.
It's so sad to think that he and the donkey in 4A used to play so well together.
They didn't mention this in the Airbnb listing.
Ignore what?
He is an elephant. This is a room. Why can't we just leave it at that?
I miss the 800 pound gorilla!
I can't help feeling there's something we need to discuss.
Let's just agree it's a gray area.
He's requesting political asylum.
Your turn to empty the litter box.
Any other cliches you want to bring in here?
There's a metaphor in the room.
"You never listen! I said what this room needed was something ELEGANT!
He doesn't want to talk about it either!
Actually, I was was referring to the fact that you're having an affair.
Fine, I had an affair.
I know you think his cold is no big thing, but I think it's a mistake to ignore the rheum in the elephant.
I told him he could stay until his party redeems itself.
I always assumed it was a metaphor.
Let's donate to the Democrats next time.
I don't complain about the donkey in the kitchen, Charles.
I almost prefer the 800-pound gorilla.
Don't worry. He'll be gone by November 9.
I told him it was ok to hide out here until after the election.
No more house-sitting for the Ringlings.
I miss the days when the political parties just called on the phone.
This is the last time we pet sit for the Ringlings.
Do you still want to stand right behind your party?
Why couldn't you have taken severance pay like everyone else when you retired from the circus?
He looked so much smaller on Ebay
Can we discuss the room the elephant is in?
I'd say that the elephant in the room IS the elephant in the room.
I miss the 800 pound gorilla.
Was that YOU or the elephant?
He's a rescue.
Kevin, I'm sleeping with your brother.
That reminds me, Ellen. Your mother called.
He asked if he could hide here til after the election.
I asked the company for a service animal that would help with my memory.
What elephant?
I miss the 800-pound gorilla.
Which big ass are we talking about?
We are all that's left of the Republican Party so we got the elephant.
I'm more concerned about the alligator in the bathtub.
Next time you win at poker take the money.
He’s hiding here until after the election.
Don't worry. She's only hiding here until November 9th.
All I'm saying is we'd just have more room if you were a Democrat.
His name is Harold. Stop referring to him as the elephant in the room.
I think he misses the ones in the other rooms.
Until 2020?!!
'Subsaharan mammal with 8 letters'?...that's a tough one.
This not mentioning him thing can't be good for his self-esteem.
He is in the witness protection program until the election is over.
You didn't even notice my new glasses.
What elephant?
You're just dying for me to say 'what elephant?'
He's scared, sad, and ashamed. So, I told him he could hide-out here until November 9th.
Please stop saying, What Elephant?
This is the worst Airbnb yet
So, what do you want to talk about?
You just had to join the 'Metaphor of the Month Club', didn't you?
On the other hand, our roses are flourishing.
I'd rather not talk about it.
I'm hoping he'll go away on his own after the election.
If you deny that there's an elephant in the room, then you clean up the mess!
It's hiding from the Republicans
Well, then can we talk about the 800lb gorilla in the dining room?
I tried sweeping it under the rug.
What elephant?
I said I wanted an "Elegant" coffee table...
i think we need more newspaper
... And the Zoo don't mind you working from home?
Stop being so literal.
Couldn't we have just gotten the bumper sticker?
You left the back door open, didn't you?
The cleaning lady said she's not coming back.
I never thought I'd say this but I prefer the 800 lb. gorilla.
Even if we're not going to talk about it, we should at least do something about the smell.
Can we at least talk about it?
What elephant?
But what if the elephant in the room is the elephant in the room?
What elephant?
He's only hiding here till November 9th.
The Humane Society said he was a lab mix.
What elephant?
I always thought it was a metaphor.
Because he remembered my birthday, that's why.
Dear, I think there's a cliché in the room.
Why can't you use metaphors like everyone else?
It was this or the 800 lb. gorilla.
A simple 'Trump/Pence' lawn sign didn't do it, huh?
What elephant?
The what?
Honey, remember those drugs I had leftover from college?
You know, you could have just gotten a lawn sign
I DID say no at first. But when he threw in the rhino I just couldn't resist. By the way, don't go in the den.
Call the exterminator and say we still have them.
First the political phone calls, now this! What's next?
Yes, that's right, it's the end of the Republican Party.
You voted for him. You clean it up.
Why couldn't you just put a sign on the lawn!
No, I said I wanted an elegant house.
Yes, literally.
They were having a trunk sale.
Where there's one, there's bound to be more. I'm calling Orkin in the morning.
All these years I thought it was just a figure of speech.
Is it me, or are we in a thinly veiled political cartoon again?
Where's the 800-pound gorilla when you need him?
No, I'm not speaking metaphorically.
Stop acting like you don't notice it! If you don't like the rug I'll just return it.
Either talk about it or be prepared to replace the carpet?
Is there anything you want to tell me?
At least he kicked out the 800-pound gorilla.
Bill, remember when we cared more about sex than politics?
What elephant?
So, we addressed it. Now what?
Ignore him. He's just an idiom.
We shouldn't have said we're undecided.
The monkey on my back was definitely worse.
Literally.
Most people just have yard signs.
I got tired of canvassers asking who I was supporting this election.
I was actually referring to your alcoholism.
It seems like we never have anything to talk about any more.
I need to tell you something. I'm a democrat.
Just relax, will you! I told you: he'll be gone on November 9th!
He wants to join the circus. I'm all for it.
I thought the 25th anniversary was silver.
I thought we agreed to stay away from politics for one night...
What Elephant?
What elephant?
Let's hope he is only a figure of speech.
So... what shall we talk about?
I've met someone.
I find the Republican canvassing a little intrusive this year, don't you dear?
He begged me to hide him until November 9th.
No, it's the elephant in the other room we need to address.
She's a rescue.
I thought it was just a saying.
If we talk about not talking about it, are we actually talking about it?
I need an eight-letter word beginning with E.
How much did you contribute...?
It really would be easier to be Democrats.
George, you do realize you're in his chair.
He's hiding out here until after the election.
No, you tell her 'her ass looks big.'
There must be a better way to flatten out the rug.
He's still endorsing him, but no longer out there campaigning.
A Trump sign on the front lawn would've been enough for most people.
I should warn you. I saw a mouse downstairs.
She wants to hide out until the election is over.
Mind if I hang out here till November 9?
'I always thought it was just a euphemism"
What elephant?
Ok, but as soon as the election is over he's gone.
What elephant?
What elephant?
We're married, but we're first cousins. You're gay. My combined SAT was 578, not 778. Grandpa Todd was the mixed-race illegitimate son of a Grand Wizard! … So what am I missing?
And there's an 800-pound gorilla in the kitchen.
Go ahead Captain Obvious, just say it.
Couldn't you just get a Trump T-shirt?
I see you're now ignoring both of us.
Would a little subtlety kill you?
I know you're voting Republican this year, but most people just go put a sign on the front lawn.
Honey, I can't sit here in silence anymore. You have a piece of food in your teeth.
Well, he can just hide from Trump somewhere else!
Did you ever feel life has become one big cliche?
Well at least I don't have to clean up after the metaphorical one.
Sometimes the elephant in the room is really an elephant in the room.
This is still not the biggest ass I've seen for the Republican Party.
Next time we post on Airbnb, we should just say ‘no pets.’
The counseling did really help: I don't see a problem either.
Maybe we can live with that 900 lb. gorilla after all.
When you said you wanted a convention souvenir I was thinking more of a button.
Some memory. He can't even remember to wipe his feet.
You promise he will be gone Nov. 9th?
Well, it hasn't been a circus for me, either.
I knew you couldn't go an evening without bringing it up. I just knew it.
I needed someone who might actually remember our anniversary.
Watch this--I've been teaching Pixie to roll over.
If you smell something, say something.
And she knows we're peanut-free?
All right, what DO you want to talk about?
Is there any way we can regift this.
Couldn't you have just gotten a bumper sticker like everybody else?
We could try to ignore him, but I've heard he never forgets a face.
You brought him home. You walk him.
What does "sort of housebroken" mean?
What room?
Hurry up with that paper. I need to put it on the floor.
I can't believe you bought that rug.
No, I am not speaking metaphorically.
A couple of days, ok, but he's using your bathroom.
It's your turn to walk it.
Oh, I don't know, what would YOU like to talk about?
If you are not going to talk about it, at least get some more newspaper.
While you're at it, look in the classifieds for a huge shovel.
I said I wanted an ELEGANT rug.
Define "housebroken."
What room?
No, I don't think an elephant door is the answer
I thought it looked better in the corner.
When I said we should help save the elephants, this isn't what I had in mind.
Your idiom left a steaming metaphor on the carpet
You let him in. You own him. After November 8th, you clean up his mess!
He wants to make the living room great again.
The lease said service animals, not circus animals.
I understood the metaphor; I don't need a demonstration.
How's the therapy elephant working out?
I'm this close to buying a mouse.
I couldn't say no. He needed a place to hide until after the election.
It's like we have nothing to talk about anymore.
Yes, I meant that literally.
I'm fine with not talking about it, but how am I supposed to not smell it?
Let's move to the den, he just ate.
Honey I can't hide it from you any longer... I bought a new rug.
Does everything in our life have to be a cliche?
What elephant?
If you could look up for a minute, you'd see I'm not speaking figuratively.
Let's see you sweep this problem under the rug.
It's your turn to take him out. And you better bring a bag, he didn't go earlier.
Sometimes the elephant in the room is just the elephant in the room.
Did you ever consider not letting the kids have the final say about what pet to get?
Well, SOMEONE farted.
I hope that was you.....
Yes, but who is the HEAD of the Republican Party?
Of course I can't see the big picture. The damn elephant is in the way.
No, the other elephant in the room.
You haven't said a word about my new hair color.
Sometimes the elephant in the room is just an elephant
What I wanna know is, when's he gonna acknowledge US?!
I think it's time we talked about the room the elephant's in.
You didn't even notice I had my hair done today.
If I can ignore him, I can certainly ignore you.
I told you if you fed it, it would follow you home.
Trust me, everyone wants to talk about it.
I liked it better when it was just a metaphor.
And I say someone's been feeding him cooked cabbage again.
I don’t care what Mr. Ringling said at the retirement party, most people get a gold watch.
He knows you're ignoring him.
I didn't think that in all New York I'd have such trouble finding a walker.
We stole their mascot. Now what?
I'd rather talk about what's on the floor in the other room.
Somebody was not a good pachyderm today.
Where did you hide the P-E-A-N-U-T-S?
Did I complain when you brought home a ferret?
Well, aren't you going to ask?
He looked so sad. He was just hanging around the polling place with tears in his eyes.
Just when were you planning to tell me about her?
"Here it is, Pachyderm Pampers. Box of two $47.50.
Sometimes I wish we were Democrats.
I hope your metaphor is housebroken.
He remembers everything you tell him and is willing to work for peanuts.
I think I prefer the eight hundred pound gorilla.
How about an eight-letter word for buyer's remorse?
I hope you used Amazon Prime.
Don't worry, it will be gone November 8.
His name is Cliche'.
I think the couple downstairs will appreciate the throw rug.
Here's a new wrinkle.
What election?
At least this time you're using "literally" correctly.
This is the only way I know to stop the rug from curling.
It wasn't me.
What room?
What elephant?
This reminds me. I want a divorce.
That's the end of the GOP as we know it.
Now he says he isn't leaving after the election.
There must be SOMETHING we can talk about.
Yes, but how did it get in?
It'll be nice to stop talking about this on November 9th.
The end is near.
Metaphorically speaking, he's the perfect pet for us.
Okay, we've addressed it...now what?
Anything interesting in the paper?
Fine. What do YOU want to talk about?
NOW do you see why the Shankars were so eager to housesit our cat last month?
Dump Trump. There I said it. Now make it go away!
It was difficult for the elephant to ignore the people in the room.
I told you we should have bought the skeleton in the closet instead.
What elephant?
So long as he never sees our piano keys, we have nothing to fear.
No, not literally as in 'figuratively,' but as in 'literally.'
How long can he just pretend we're not here?
Where?
Being married to a taxidermist is no picnic either.
He's hiding out until the election's over.
I just wanted to see how far i could go with our Amazon Prime membership
The maid wants a raise.
So... What should we talk about this evening?
I'm truly at a loss for a metaphor here.
I think it's time we finally addressed the obvious: We need a larger apartment.
It looked smaller in the showroom.
He's starting to identify as a donkey.
I told you not to get rid of the 800-pound gorilla.
Further to the right and we're in trouble.
I don't look fat now!
It says here nine out of ten idioms go unnoticed.
What elephant?
Are you still not thinking about what I'm not thinking about?
Anything interesting in the news, dear?
So we're in agreement, next month he's gone but the jackass stays.
I think I'm just more of a cat person
I don’t care if he stays. Just keep him out of the oval office.
What elephant?
We're living a cliché.
Well, guess who DID remember our anniversary.
I don't mind talking about him, I just don't want to clean up after him.
You're the one who wanted to live in a Trump building.
I get the hint, Carl, but I'm still voting for Hillary.
You don't want to see what's in the closet
He just wants to hide here until after the election.
I'll stop using that expression if you get rid of him.
Well, he's not interested in talking about you, either.
The elephant in the room IS the elephant in the room.
What elephant?
Discuss what?
No other Republican would take him.
Point taken, I'm still voting for Hillary.
This is not what I meant when we agreed to host a refugee from the Congo.
You're always 'too tired' to walk him!
But shipping was free.
At least he won't forget our anniversary.
That's it; am registering as a Democrat next time. I'm used to living with an ass in the house.
What elephant?
No, what I said was I wanted to be relevant.
He said he didn't leave the party, the party left him.
Whew--was that you?
People always say the house seems so empty once the kids move out.
I got it here, you gift wrap it.
Wake up Mark, it's not a metaphor!
I said I'd like something elegant, e l e G a n t!
After we avoid discussing it, I'm calling the zoo.
What elephant?
Sometime I wish we were democrats.
I assumed “watch Jangles” meant their cat.
I don't know. What's an eight letter word that begins with E and ends with T?
I was looking for something less metaphorical.
He wants to lay low until the election's over.
No, really, I would prefer a skeleton in the closet.
All we need to do is move to another room! There, we addressed it!
So I'm guessing you're no longer a closet Republican?
I couldn't find an 800 pound gorilla
No, I don't mean figuratively.
What did you want to talk about, dear?
"Did you remember to buy garbage bags"?
I think it's time to talk about the walrus in the kitchen.
The elephant in the room and I are leaving you.
It's hiding until the election is over.
Do I need to explain figurative and literal to you again?
With two day shipping it was too good to pass up.
I'm thinking tile.
Maybe next time just bring me back a T-shirt?
Because it was a wedding gift from my aunt, that's why. We never use the crockpot from your Grandmother, why don't we get rid of that?
I know about the affair.
Never thought we would need more trunk space in the house.
What happened to the 800 pound gorilla?
The elephant in the room is the elephant in the room.
No more raffle tickets from the ASPCA.
I thought you said it was a figure of speech.
No, I want to talk about the other elephant in the room.
It seems like all we ever talk about is the elephant in the room.
It's time we address the cliché in the room.
Oh? And do you have a better solution for those corners that curl up on our rugs?
The kids are calling him T-Rump.
It's not 'if,' it's 'when,' and you're the one who picks it up.
"What's an eight letter word for 'Large circus animal"?
Don't say it.
Lesson learned. Never let the kids pick out a pet.
The 800-pound gorilla had the night off
If he's not housebroken, we're in deep doodoo.
I kind of thought it would leave once we addressed it.
That wasn't me.
At least he's out of the closet.
And best of all, he doesn't shed.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I think we should talk about it
Well, as far as I'm concerned...we're not ignoring it, it's ignoring us.
Let's NOT talk about it and see what happens when your mother gets here.
You promised he'd be gone after Election Day.
Al, you haven't said anything about the new rug.
I'm not letting you sweep this under the rug Harold.
The elephant in the room IS the elephant in the room.
Ignore him, he's idiomatic.
Look, you didn't eat them and I didn't eat them. The peanuts didn't just walk out of here on their own.
It really ties the room together.
Did you fart?
The bumper sticker would have made the same statement.
Hopefully, he'll be gone by a week from Tuesday.
Sometimes I think he ignores the people in the room.
What elephant?
Stanley, tell him you're sorry. You know he never forgets.
No it wasn't me! I thought it was YOU!
He just wants to stay here until November 9th.
We still need to talk about where you were last night.
It's just until after the election. He's ashamed to show his face in public.
Well its better than the 800 lb gorilla that was here last week.
Couldn't you have just put an "I'm Republican" sign in the front yard?
We have to talk
Sometimes I wish we were democrats.
Actually, I think it's time we discuss the 800 pound gorilla in the bedroom.
Do you smell gas?
I told him he could hide out here until after the election.
Next time, I suggest you use 'the fly in the ointment' reference instead of 'the elephant in the room.'
What do you mean you don't want to talk about it?
I walked him last night.
When you said we could get another boarder for peanuts... I had no idea....
Just lift the tail and vote.
Honey, he knows he's in the room. There's no need to make him feel bad about it.
I can't wait until this election is over.
The poor thing just needs a place to lay low for awhile.
Was that you
Really Henry we couldn't just put a Trump sign out front like everyone else.
I don't care if he got thrown out of Trump Tower. He's not staying here
This is almost too obvious.
Alright, I'm just gonna say it.
You know you can tell me if you voted Trump, right?
Right, like he's going to forget that snide remark.
I think I prefer the 800-lb gorilla.
I'd rather not talk about it.
Not much, you?
I know you like the Republicans but I'm not cleaning up all the crap that comes with that
But on the upside they don't shed
He wants to be a donkey for Halloween.
The election's over; why is he still here?
Honey, it will leave as soon as we acknowledge that it's here.
Please have it move along dear, before it drops a trump.
Let's discuss the obvious caption in the room.
Seriously, I am still voting for Hillary!
It's the Trump in the room
We either have to talk about it or get a bigger room.
You never listen to me. I did not say it would be nice to have an elephant living in the room. I said it would nice to have an elegant living room."
It's fully inflated, now what?
At least with the 800 pound gorilla we had room for a loveseat.
What do you mean you forgot to pick up a litter box?!
I think he wants to go outside
You can ignore him, but I'm not cleaning that rug.
This is the last time we offer to watch the neighbor's pet while they're away.
You were always one too many Republicans in the room, Wayne. This is a crowd.
Put the paper down Harry
There's something we need to talk about.
It's your turn to walk him.
He wants asylum until after the elections are over.
You could have just let a cat out of a bag.
If we're not going to talk about it at least tell it to get off the rug.
I'm more concerned about the one not in the room.
You couldn't book us a table by the trunk?
I thought they were supposed to go away, or something, once you talked about them.
I wouldn't recommend tickling the ivories right now,
He says he wants to represent a new party, preferably in Canada.
We better take him for a walk before he takes another trump!
I liked him better when he was allegorical.
You still can't see it??
The figure of speech is very pungent.
Then again, maybe he's ignoring us.
We really need to move to a swing state.
There. We don't have to talk about the 800 pound gorilla in the room any more.
Oh no? Well, nothing bothering me either.
Still no notice of a reward for a missing elephant?
I brought him home so we'd have something to talk about.
Aren't you taking your Republican State Chairmanship assignment a bit too seriously?
Do you smell gas?
Still not changing my vote.
The 800 lb. gorilla smelled better.
He hasn't been the same since we got rid of the 800 pound gorilla.
No, I mean literally.
Have you been leaving out peanuts for the squirrels again Martha?
Sooner or later, they're bound to realize he's missing.
I've always thought that was just an expression.
You can't revive a dead metaphor with a visual aid.
No, George. It's the antelope in the bathroom that upsets me.
The Feng Shui consultant also thinks we should take the skeletons out of the front closet.
The 800-pound gorilla might have been a better fit.
I'm switching parties
But on the positive side, he doesn't shed.
I refuse to make this about politics.
The house is going to feel empty when he leaves for college.
Can't we EVER talk about something else?
We have a mouse problem.
You haven't even mentioned my new hairstyle!
If it stays much longer, the elephant won't be only thing in the room.
I don't need to know more about Dumbo, I'm voting for the Jackass!
Let's see how you'll sweep THAT under the rug.
I don't know. What do YOU want to talk about?
I spy, with my little eye, something grey.
Let's not talk about it and just get a bigger room
What's wrong George? It's like you've been walking on peanut shells all evening.
Trust me, it's going to look a whole lot worse deflated.
You can't keep ignoring him, dear - his name is Donald, and he's not going away any time soon.
I cleaned the litter box last night.
No need to go "graphic" on me Carl, I know what a metaphor is!
All I'm saying Peter is that a donkey would be much easier to manage in the house
It's your turn to clean the litter box.
Some mirrors could make the room feel more spacious.
Can't we just sweep it under the rug ?
He's been sulking since Election Night.
Yes, but to him, we're the people in the living room.
Must you speak to him like that? You know how long it takes him to forget these things.
They were out of goldfish.
No. this is the one everybody talks about.
How ironic that the elephant in the room is not the elephant in the room.
This is just a big game to you.
For once, let's NOT talk about it.
I don't think we can brush it under the carpet
I assure you, it wasn't me
No, I quite clearly said that I miss my Oliphant.
Should we tell him he's adopted?
Good news, Lenore. Peanuts are on sale at the market.
Do you suppose he thinks that we're the people in the room?
He's hiding from Donald.
It's your turn to walk him.
I think she needs to go out.
Can we at least talk about emptying the litter box?
Don't worry, dear, on November 8th it will disappear for another eight years.
Frankly, I'd prefer we start with the 800 pound gorilla first.
I'll still miss him when he goes to college.
What happened to the "I voted" stickers?
We should talk about the inattentive husband in the room.
Ignore it? I've just named it Jumbo and taught it to roll over.
He's in hiding. Just until November 9th.
Let's hope he concedes gracefully.
Jumbo, it's time we talked about the husband in the room.
No, it won't make our living room great again.
It is magnificent, but I just wanted your mother's silverware.
I don't care how good a deal it was.
Doesn't this make our living room great again?
Are you certain he's housebroken?
Hang in there. He'll be gone after election day.
Would you have preferred the 500 lb. gorilla?
Only idiots put idioms in the living room.
No, I mean it literally, we need to discuss the elephant in the room.
Dammit - it's supposed to be a metaphor!
We could but it kind of ruins the metaphor.
Is there anything else that you don't want to discuss?
Then, can we talk about the humans in the room?
This election is taking up too much of my personal space!
Well, thanks to PETA he can't work in the circus any more.
Next time, turn Siri off when you're speaking metaphorically.
No, I don't want to teach him to roll over.
O don't care how h-u-u-ge he gets, I'm never going to vote for him.
If we vote Democrat does he go away?
Well, I wanted to talk about it during the primaries.
We should've voted Democrat.
It's just a metaphor.
What elephant?
Somehow I don't think you've told me everything.
If you're talking about the elephant in the room, he can hear you.
I hate it when they talk about me like I'm not here.
Well, okay, what would you rather talk about?
He looked a lot smaller in the store.
Honestly, it is easier than I thought to not talk about this.
That wasn't me .
First things first; how did you get it inside the house?
You're not going to give me that "what elephant" line again, are you?
It's pretending we're not here again.
We need to talk.
I took him out last time.
If we switched parties we would cut pet food bill in half.
Are you really, really sure you don't have anything to tell me, Harvey?
There are at least ten female elephants questioning his claim to forget.
I told you it wasn't a metaphor.
He's only staying until after the election.
I give up. Which political party ARE you supporting?
I'm torn between the elephant in the room and the fly on the wall.
We put down rugs, I stopped walking in heels...and the downstairs neighbors STILL complained?
My therapist says I suffer from peanuts envy.
WE need to build a wall, Bob.
This is just as bad as that time Godot finally arrived.
First things first...that light bulb is far too bright
Don't give her anything spicy to eat!
You said you wanted a housekeeper who will work for peanuts.
Just ignore it!
Now where is the 800-pound gorilla going to sit?
Can you believe this weather we're having?
Yeah, of course it clogged the toilet.
Don't you hate when the elephant in the room is an elephant in the room?
But he hates when you invite your blind friends over.
Honey, I think he needs to go out...
"It's your turn to clean the litter box".
I found him at a debate, and he seemed so lost...
Let's call him Bigly.
He's the first licensed therapy animal for--well, I forget.
So what HAVEN'T we talked about?
You know perfectly well what we need to talk about.
What makes you think I'm planning to vote Republican?
Nice try. I'm still not voting for him.
Are you sure it’s not a simile?
I know they're endangered but can't we just send a check?
We already discussed this, the rug stays.
What if the condo board finds out?
The Feng Shui feels wrong — can we rotate him ninety degrees?
The elephant in the room is the elephant in the room.
And when do you think WILL be the right time to talk about it?
I agree we need to talk about him, but not behind his back.
Sorry, dear. I didn't know it was a metaphor.
Watch what you say. He has big ears!
We also need to address the metaphor.
I think it goes without saying.
Hope he doesn't take a trump.
I wonder if the house keeper will want a raise?
Most people, of course, are content to indicate their preference with a simple yard sign, but ohhh no...
Obviously!
This is starting to feel different from ignoring NPR pledge drives.
We'd be talking about it if it was a donkey.
No there isn't.
Oh, and we will need a litter box.
Maybe after the election it will go away.
I wanted a dog but got an idiom
Maybe we should address climate change after all.
Don't worry dear, it's not turning to the left.
Hello... I’m standing right here! It’s not like I don’t know you’re talking about me!
I am still voting Democrat
Did it occur to you that we are the elephants in his room?
No Harold, that's not the roar of the crowd I hear.
It's safer than a Trump lawn sign.
John, is there something you want to tell me?
Why must you be so literal all of the time?
For once, can we talk about something other than the elephant in the room?
It wasn't me!!
G.O.P. refugee
You told me it was just a metaphor.
I just don't know how elephants can ignore the couple in the room.
Let's give them a break. The tenants downstairs are under a ton of pressure.
The shelter was going to put him to sleep.
Yes, I did say your cousin could move in, but you didn't tell me he was a Republican.
You only said you didn't want a cat.
They'll still consider it voter intimidation.
What elephant ?
Yes, we talked about having an elephant, but after we were settled and had a house out in the suburbs.
His party left him for an invertebrate.
So, what do you want to talk about?
We need to discuss the 800-pound gorilla in the bedroom.
No really, I mean there is AN ELEPHANT in the room!
I always thought it was just an English metaphorical idiom for an obvious truth that is going unaddressed.
I sense a "but" coming...
He's too embarrassed to show his face until the election's over.
It's insensitive to talk about the elephant in the room while he's still in the room.
Jane, stop with the metaphors and tell me what is bothering you!
So, how was your day?
I promise to quit if he turns pink.
Couldn't we just wear a 'Vote Republican' badge like everyone else , Abe ?
No, actually, I still don't want to talk about it.
And I thought he was YOUR elephant.
Oh, I dunno. What do you want to talk about?
Why do I have this feeling that we have a major obstacle in our lives that we refuse to acknowledge?
He said he'll move once you give him the sports section.
Well he doesn't forget he's here.
Literally!
What do you mean you can't see it? Tusk,Tusk!
Okay, we've talked about it. Now what?
Well, Frank, on November 9th it's going to be the dead elephant in the room.
What part of "Trump's behind" do you not get?
You are always so literal.
The downstairs neighbors want to pay for our counseling sessions.
Please be careful what you metaphor.
Did you fart?
What's wrong with you? I placed that newspaper on the edge of the carpet for a reason.
Isn't it your turn to take him out?
He's staying with us until he remembers his address.
Oh, and the taxidermist called.
He's hiding from the circus clowns.
Can't we talk about something else for a change?
So, Mr. Animal Planet, If he never forgets, then why is he standing on my good rug, again?
Did you finish my peanuts?
It's going to be OK. He's on his way out.
No, I'm talking about your affair with your secretary.
Is there something you're not telling me?
Oh my god, try telling me that wasn't one of yours!
We need to talk about the Republican in the room.
'Well, one of us has to walk him, and soon.'
Either we talk about it, or we get a bigger place.
Don't you think it's time we talk about 'you know who'?
You know, there's a limit to party loyalty.
Yes, Dorothy, cliches really do come true.
Are we going to talk about the skeleton in your closet?
I can't believe that our lives have been reduced to a cliche.
Is there something you're not telling me?
So, is there something we need to talk about?
No, honey, he can't hide here for 4 years!
my analyst said that if we don't acknowledge him today he will be even bigger tomorrow
"I prefer the metaphor".
Look, if you want to vote Republican, just tell me.
Well that makes two of us who will never forget.
If you won't say it, I will. This room needs to be painted.
Sorry...they were out of 800 lb. gorillas.
Honey, we need to talk about the two humans in the room.
That's not his breath!
It won't be much longer. He's just hiding out until after the election.
I thought it was a metaphor too, until I saw that big pile of poop.
I hope you remember what happened the last time you forgot to take him for his walk.
I think it's time we gave him his own room.
Mom, Dad... Am I adopted??
It's only for a few days. The Olivers will be back on Friday.
Your turn to clean the litter box.
To be honest with you, I'd rather not talk about it.
T-rump
Darling, I can't just ignore that the end is near.
He said it would be the greatest, biggest, most successful, beautiful dump we've ever seen.
Thought you'd never ask! From Amazon, but I had to pay the shipping.
If only he'd remember to put the seat down.
I said I wanted an ELEGANT conversation piece.
I just hope and pray she never wants to turn around.
You know, when he gets that look, we need to move fast.
The Republicans are taking up too much space in our marriage.
I don't want to talk about him - I'm more concerned with the hippo in our bathtub.
I don't want to talk about it.
I guess the 800 pound gorilla had the day off.
how much was the carpet alone?
It's ignoring us.
Must you always be literal?
Of course I noticed the new rug, honey.
It's Donald Trump's version of homeland security.
Talk? About what, dear?
Since I been going to AA they are no longer pink.
Some things we just don't discuss in this household.
I got him at a wide elephant sale.
Gee, what should we talk about?
"The elephant in the room is a 23-year-old blonde paralegal named Amy. Can you see it now?
Nobody ever said right wing extremism would be easy.
I only asked for a yard sign.
No, I meant the other elephant in the room.
I don't want to talk about it.
I think he's voting Democrat this year.
Why can't you just put out a yard sign like everyone else?
It's your turn to change the litter.
I read the lease. It said nothing about elephants.
It's not a metaphor for anything? Are you saying we've been living with an actual elephant in the room all this time?
Let's hope he doesn't forget we're sitting here.
I literally don't know what you're talking about.
I said elegant, not elephant.
The elephant in the room is the elephant in the room.
Your shirt collar, the lipstick, it's time we talk.
I'm just going to say it. We need a bigger place.
No, I want to talk about our marriage.
Look, I know I said I wouldn't bring it up again, but...
Either way, you just gotta hold your nose and vote.
If I put one in every room, then will you talk about it?
We deflate it November 8th .
"OK. You've made your point. Now how do we get it out?
Should we tell him that we're Democrats?
But, my therapist thinks I should stop ignoring it.
He's hiding here until after the election.
I think it's time you acknowledge the lady in the room, Tom.
...and now it's all anyone ever wants to talk about.
You promised to stop this after the china shop incident.
He has to go out. It's your turn. I walked him this morning.
Can we talk about the rug?
The cinnamon spice air freshener isn't doing it.
I'm hoping it goes away on Nov 8th!
He did go to the bathroom before you let him back inside... right?
OK, in our divorce settlement you can have the cliché.
Metaphorically speaking!? Metaphorically speaking, have you lost your mind?
Would you please stop using that expression!
It's not working. The more we talk about him, the longer he stays.
It's either him or me.
The sooner we address this, the sooner our grocery bills go down.
His name is Donald
You always take things so literally.
I think it's time for us to discuss metaphors.
I agree that he's trying to intimidate me, but I'm still voting.
I told you, I don't want to talk about it!
What makes you think I'm beating around the bush?
No one ever asks if there is ROOM for the elephant in the room.
I wish you'd just gotten a yard sign!
Thanks for making our house great again
I know it's between this thing and Hillary, I'm not happy either.
I miss understood it when you said that having a pet would only cost us only peanuts.
Wouldn't a "Make America Great Again" cap have sufficed?
I hate it when he butts in to our conversations.
It's just a figure of speech. Ignore it and it'll go away.
Do metaphors poop?
This may be the end of the GOP
He's hiding out until after the election.
Do you smell peanuts?
Despite his attempts, Jumbo simply could not deny the two people in the room.
Why can't I shake the feeling that there's something you're not telling me?
How did you think the Ringling elephant foster program worked?
They're all cute when they're small.
Of course I want to talk about the literal one.
What are you talking about?
At least I didn't adopt a highway.
Don't say anything. That's just what he wants
Literally.
I thought it was only an expression!
He told me he's sick and tired of being a damned metaphor.
You know people traditionally have just the head mounted.
I asked you not to mention it.
Honey, there is something I need to address.
O.K., I'll just say it. I HATE the new rug.
From now on, I'll handle our daughter's online transactions.
So when did this become a safehouse for principled Republicans?
We need to talk about your use of metaphor.
...literally...
I hate it when he ignores us.
I'm so relieved that its not a pink one.
When did you say they'll return from vacation?
What's that smell?
You had to bring it up!
You're so literal!
It looked so much smaller in the showroom.
Yes dear, what is it?
Don't worry, It will be gone by November 8th.
This last minute campaigning has gotten a bit out of hand.
He followed me home.
Yes, and there's a rhino in the front room. We never talk about that, either.
I miss the 800-pound gorilla!
There's A What?
He swears he made the reservation on Air BnB.
Now that we ACTUALLY have it here, I can confirm that yours isn't as big.
Very clever, dear. Mother is still coming to visit.
He said he was looking for the Reagan years but got lost.
Do you think if we leave him somewhere he'll remember where we live
She says it's not easy being a cliche.
When we closed the local campaign office, I had to take either him or Trump
It's my Party and I'll cry if I want to ...
You have cleanup duty on November 9.
I preferred when the Republicans handed out bumper stickers.
What happened to our 800 pound gorilla?
it's not the room I'm worried about. It's the nation.
I said be prudent what you feed him and you feed him prunes!
Anything we need to discuss?
It's ultimately his career decision, dear. Have you ever considered that he wouldn't MIND working for peanuts?
Don't forget, dear, later tonight six blind men are coming to feel Kimba.
I think we'll need more than one newspaper!
Don't try to change the subject.
We need to talk about our peanut budget.
The man downstairs called.....the same old complaint.
What elephant?
I understand you're making a point but think about the poor elephant.
Can we talk about something else?
This is nothing compared to what's in the bedroom
Damn Republicans really get in your face!
Earl, what's that phrase everybody uses when something is obvious?
Jesus, Frank, you take everything so literally.
Does this party make my ass look big?
I'm still not going to talk about it.
Why can't you admit the rug doesn't go with the room? For goodness sakes, just look at it!
The donkeys have been picking on him again.
My profile clearly said I like to tickle the ivories at home
I think a sticker would have sufficed to show your party affiliation
Okay, I get it. You're voting Republican.
...and it came with free delivery
I ordered the 800 pound gorilla.
We need to talk.
Can we at least talk about the grizzly bear in the kitchen?
We never should have switched parties.
I liked it better when we weren't talking about him.
I wish we'd bought the donkey.
He'd just as soon forget this election.
Well, honey, I think it's time we address the lamp in the room.
Don't say m-i-c-e.
So what do you want to talk about?
It's your turn to empty the litter box.
I'm having second thoughts about joining the idiom of the month club.
Let's first address your grasp of metaphor.
Because, Bill, it's impolite to talk about someone while they are still in the room.
It's your turn to walk him.
Ignore him. He's just an idiom.
After she delivers we might need a bigger place.
Does this room make my butt look big?
If that mouse comes back, we're doomed.
I've been meaning to talk to you about your use of the word 'literally.'
Who's being too literal now, Frank?
This time, it's NOT a metaphor, Larry.
I think you know what I'm talking about.
Some call this the end of the GOP.
The elephant in the room is the elephant in the room.
"When I donated to Adopt An Elephant, who would have thought.....?
No. I'm not trying to bring up your alleged affair. I'm being literal.
I took him out last time.
Maybe if we ignore him, he'll go away.
Now that elephants are off the endangered species list, can we give it back?
Let's at least acknowledge that the tenants downstairs are under a ton of pressure.
It is your turn to clean out the litter box.
She's trying to dump Trump, but seems to be constipated.
Don't try to blame that one on the elephant Frank.
I don't know, I just can't shake the feeling there's something big we're ignoring.
Have you seen the cat?
He wants the leash and you shouldn't forget the shovel.
Why didn't he just run away and join the circus when he grew up like his sister did.
Yes Dear, the concierge said he belongs to Anthony Weiner
Don't you dare say it.
She’s embarrassed by her affiliation with Trump so she’s hiding out here until after the election.
So. How was YOUR day?
You think it's easy being the only Ringling sister?
He was a terrible pet. Why'd we think he'd make a good coffee table?
I told you not to send that metaphor to the 3-D printer!
Life was so much better with the donkey.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I told you not to leave the door open.
It's not a metaphor
You can't avoid the discussion any longer, why can't my mother join us with our friends for dinner?
You could have made your point without being so literal.
Your turn to walk him.
What weren't we talking about again?
Metaphorical or not, he's standing on my keys.
No I do not think you've made our living room great again.
He's just hiding here until the election is over.
He just needs a place to hide until Election Day.
Do you think we can put it behind us after the election?
Nobody talks about the elephant poop in the room.
I have a nagging feeling there is something you do not want to discuss.
Our new neighbors have two elephants.
I know you are big on supporting your party, but wouldn't a donkey take up less room?
What?......I picked him up at the GOP estate sale. They were practically giving him away.
Why don't we try addressing it directly?
If we paint the walls red it might make the room look bigger
How long can you ignore the trump in the room?
Back when he was 200 lbs, you said there was nothing to talk about.
Harold, for once the 'elephant in the room' is an actual elephant, and you still won't acknowledge it.
do you smell that?
Elephant? What elephant?
We've been sitting here for hours and you haven't even noticed, so yes, I got new glasses.
I feel like we're in an ad for erectile dysfunction.
Couldn't the Republicans just send a flyer like everyone else?
So if the board asks, assure them that it's a teacup breed.
I'm sick of your clichés.
Honestly, I'd rather talk about the elephant.
We need to talk about the Republican in the room.
Vote as you wish, but I'm not cleaning up after him.
Are you sure you prayed for eloquence?
Nothing worth mentioning ... how was your day?
So how was Vegas last weekend?
My therapist thinks I'm a closet Republican.
I've been trying to tell you, Tim... I've switched parties.
I've never liked this rug.
Well, we've talked about him, now what do we do?
"Martha, I need an eight-letter word for pachyderm. ..?
You get the feeling that it is trying to ignore us?
I know it's something you don't want to talk about, but I have a real problem with the rug.
It's a good thing the lamp was included.
I still think that the new rug would have flattened out on its own.
More importantly, we need to talk about the manure in the room.
Go ahead. Talk about it.
Do we really need props for all of your idioms?
He's hiding here until November 9.
Well, It's this or an 800-pound gorilla!
It's your turn to clean the litter box.
Doesn't he know the party's over?
...elephant...gorilla...it's a metaphor you idiot!
I walked him this morning!
The lawn sign was one thing but this is taking your political affiliation thing a bit too far
For just one evening, can't you talk about something else?
I can't ignore it any longer--do you like my new glasses or not?
It's bigger than the both of us.
I've been trying to tell you... there's a donkey in the kitchen.
Not so cute when it’s bucket and broom time, is it?
All I said was, I'd vote for an elephant's rump before I'd vote for him.
Stampy and I decided that we no longer want you as a roommate.
You're going to need a bigger shovel
I told you there was no such thing as a teacup elephant.
When it craps on the rug, you'll see it's not a metaphor.
Fine. But after we address it, THEN can we discuss our unspoken relationship issues?
The next time we go on safari, I'm picking out the souvenirs
"pretending" the republicans don't exist is not going to make them go away
When the 800 lbs gorilla gets here, we have to talk.
It's your turn to empty the litter box.
If we talked about it more, maybe we'd have room for a sofa.
Pet friendly hotel when the circus is town, what were you thinking?
The litter box is full again again.
"Something you want to talk about?".
He was so cute as a baby.
A billboard on the front lawn isn't enough? Now this!
It was on sale at the Republican surplus store
So, is there anything else we need to talk about?
I'm starting to miss the gorilla.
I say, let's sweep it under the carpet.
He's using this as his safe house until after the election.
OK . OK. He's endangered already. So is our plumbing!
Honey, this is no way to heat the living room.
When your parents come over try not to bring up politics!
I bet you’ll acknowledge it when it’s your turn to clean up the living room.
You didn't notice my haircut.
This might sound crazy but let's get another elephant.
Don't worry. After election day, it will FINALLY go away.
A woolly mammoth was my first choice, but boy do they shed.
Well, does the structural integrity of the house satisfy you now?
If an elephant actually is in the room, is there really an elephant in the room?
According to my therapist, we are avoiding a major issue in our relationship--but I can't for the life of me remember what it is.
Do you think the GOP even knows they lost it?
Have you noticed it's been getting darker much earlier?
Just until after the election. I granted her asylum.
Since the debates, he's too embarrassed to be seen in public.
Sometimes the elephant in the room is just an elephant in the room.
You know how much I hate metaphors.
Fred, is there something you haven't told me?
It's an improvement on your eight hundred pound gorilla
These Trump ads are getting a little ridiculous.
I think he's hiding from Trump.
I actually hate that expression.
I preferred the 800 pound gorilla.
Hang in there. Come November 9, the 'uge ass will be gone.
It asked if it could hide here until after the election.
I walked him this morning!
All else aside, do you think it'd be okay to give him some Beano?
I feel like we're both ignoring the fact that we need a new cartoonist.
Metaphorical. Literal. What does it matter?
What
He is afraid he'll get deported.
Not figuratively. Literally.
I told you he was yuge.
Your therapist said, "Talk about the elephant in the room" not "Take the elephant in the room."
No, it is not just a metaphor!
Well it's still not obvious to me!
You just HAD to open the door, didn't you?
No, the elephant in the room is the elephant in the room.
Another party downstairs? I swear we have the worst neighbors.
He just wants to stay here until after the election.
Yes, I need the entire newspaper now
I will be glad when this election is over so he can go out in public again.
Now...back to the cheating husband in the room.
I can see the end is near.
You always take things so literally.
And you knew I had a peanut allergy...
And we need a bigger closet too. Its crowded with all those skeletons.
So that's it? You've pointed it out, and now you're done?
I know we disagree on a lot of things but this is now the face of the Republican party!
It's your turn to walk him, and don't forget the backhoe.
I think it is time to cancel that Animal Of The Month Club.
Have you seen the cat?
It's your turn to take him out.
Why haven't you said anything about my new glasses??!!
Ignore all you want. But you still have to clean up what he left in the foyer.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Can we talk about something else?
I can't help but notice that you moved my donkey out of the room.
It’s your turn to change the litter box.
Honey, I think we may be past passive aggressive.
Fine, we won't talk about it, but can we at least move to a different room?
Your turn to clean the litter box.
You should've said, "Fly on the wall.
No, this time I'm being figurative
It's just an expression
Sooner or later, we have to talk about it.
I don't remember.
So what do you want to talk about?
Shhhh, Harold.... keep your voice down.... he's very sensitive about his weight.
No, it's your turn to clean the litter box
And no, I am NOT speaking metaphorically.
See what?
...and you thought changing the cat litter was bad.
ED IS THERE AN OBVIOUS PROBLEM WE NEED TO ADDRESS?
Honey, you really do need to let go of this obsession with metaphor.
Does he leave after the election?
Ironically the elephant in the room is the elephant in the room.
My day was fine, and yours?
Are we talking about my attention deficit disorder or the actual elephant in the room?
Sometimes it's ONLY the elephant that's in the room.
what smell?
Literally.
I hope you remembered to scoop the litter box.
It's only an expression, dear.
This is why no one comes over anymore.
I don't get this Tiny House movement either.
It's your turn to walk her.
Fine, I'll return the chandelier.
I think we should get a mouse.
Milking this one is going to be tough.
He should have just promised a chicken in every pot.
Don't go in the kitchen without shoes.
Funny thing. I happened to come across a copy of our pre-nup this morning.
Can't you say anything without using a cliche?
Think he'll ever address us?
Oh, him? Well, I stopped off at Costco this afternoon to pick up groceries, and as it turns out, they're selling pets now...
What is that metaphor for an obvious truth that is going unaddressed ?
And he just stands there like we're not even in the room.
So, you mentioned there was something you wanted to talk about...
That's an antique rug your metaphor's trampling, Harold.
You know full well it wasn't me who farted.
Pull the tail. I dare you.
It's time we talk about the litter box.
This isn't going to end well.
Help me out, 13 across 'obvious truth'.
It's been so nice without your mother here, can't we just ignore it a little longer?
Well, obviously sending him to the corner doesn't work.
I don't care what the breeder said. That is not a Cocker Spaniel.
Where IS that mouse when we need him?
Tusk, tusk.
OK, so now we've addressed it...what next?
Because everyone has a dog!
I think the elephant in the room IS the elephant in the room!
The eight hundred pound gorilla was so yesterday.
Don't talk about what?
Runt of the litter, huh?
Stop pretending you don't see it.
If you didn't always have your nose in the papers, I wouldn't NEED an emotional support animal.
We can't not talk about it, alright? He said he needed a place to lay low until some "stuff" blows over.
Maybe we should just stop talking about it.
I'm worried. I think we have mice.
If we aren't going to discuss it we should get a bigger apartment.
Its so much more spacious now that we found a home for the giraffe.
Are you kidding me? What's an eight-letter word for "pachyderm?"
I don't know. What do you not want to talk about?
Does it say anything about house training?
You can't buy the tusks by themselves anymore.
I feel like there's something we should be talking about...
And don't even get me started on those stretch marks
I still think we should have gotten the puppy instead.
I thought it was a metaphor.
He just walked in here looking for the party he used to represent.
Why couldn't you just rescue a Pomeranian like every one else?
Let's not.
I'm starting to feel like we're the people in the room.
So, the bossman just struts into my office and says, "Barb and I are off on vacation, so I hope you can watch our pet."
Every four years! Let's move to a swing state.
I think the gorilla fit better...
It's what the elephant might leave in the room that I'm worried about.
You know, I heard the strangest expression today and still can't figure out what the person meant by it.
Trump's Rump!
Did you fart?
There's nothing to discuss?
I found him in my pajamas.
Should we finally discuss who you're voting for?
We need to talk.
No, I didn't fart.
Nothing. What's new with you?
Of course he remembers how he got in the room; he just doesn't know how to get out.
I just think we should talk about it.
I hate to use cliches, but that newspaper will be tomorrow's fish wrap.
I want to know what happened to the Chihuahua in the room.
This is the last time I'm sending you out to get a rescue pet.
No, seriously, there is one.
How long is your mother staying?
No dear the hard part isn't finally talking about it, it's cleaning up after it.
I know it's not ideal, but the rent's peanuts.
You left the back door open again.
Okay, since that didn't work, let me try a figure of speech.
How many 'elephant in the room' captions you think they'll get?
It's your turn, I took her out last time
What room?
I'm not familiar with the phrase.
You're sure nothing unusual happened today?
At least he didn't forget our anniversary.
He used to be the life of the party.
Couldn't you have just gotten a Trump bumper sticker like the neighbors?
It's your turn to walk him.
On our wedding day, this elephant was so much smaller
You are literally crushing me with your political metaphors
"What happened to the 800lb. gorilla?
We're gonna need a bigger broom.
You still read a newspaper? That is so weird!
He said he couldn't get along under the big tent.
At least let him have the book reviews.
Sadly, he feels he is in the way.
Definitely grand & ol'. Not much of a partier though.
metaphor schmetaphor
Are you ready to talk about it now?
I don't want to talk about it.
Well, you voted for the beast; now you get to clean up after him.
We've talked about him but he refuses to leave the room.
I told you, with a donkey we could fit a couch.
sooner or late we've got to talk about the room around our elephant
I can ignore him if you can.
Honey, it's your turn to change the litter box.
Look, if you don't want her to visit, just say so.
I DON'T want to discuss it!
Let's not talk about it.
If he passes gas, were screwed
Can we talk about alternative ways to tack down the carpet?
Trumpeting... it's the trumpeting. And the shoveling.
You know how you make friends on vacation and you tell them to visit if they are ever in town ?
Honey, I'm ok with living with a therapy animal but this is a bit much.
We should have put him outside when he was younger.
The elephant is ignoring us.
"He said calling him Dumbo is politically incorrect".
I think he's old enough to be told that he's adopted.
Not seeing it is okay. Not cleaning up after it is another matter.
This is what you get for voting Democrat.
It's already "Huge"!
You can ignore it all you want, but eventually you're going to be sorry you didn't take it out for a walk.
Yes, I admit he's here, I've just been trying to figure out how he got here.
If it doesn't give you joy you should get rid of it.
All we ever talk about is the elephant in the room.
I also have an 800 pound gorilla.
It's not the elephant in the room I'm worried about.
Look on the Bright Side, he'll Deflate after the Election.
Shouldn't talking about it make it disappear?
It's time we talked about him.
We agreed, no politics before bed.
I'm letting him stay until his party finds its way again. Is that a problem?
There are easier ways to annoy the downstairs neighbor.
It's your turn, and this time make sure you remember the plastic bags AND the shovel.
When's Noah coming back to pick up his stuff?
Honey, what do you think of my new haircut?
Well, wouldn't you want to go into hiding also?
I don't like metaphors.
We're going to need a bigger room.
What election?
If that's not an elephant, then this is not a room.
I avoid cliches like the plague, then you bring me this?
Frankly, I'd prefer more face time with him.
At least it's not pink.
What if the elephant in the room is not the elephant?
I ignored it like you said and it still ate all our cashews.
Well, if you'd get your nose out of the paper, you might actually see something for once.
I guess downsizing is out of the question.
Honey, it's time that we discuss the Republican in the room.
No - It's YOUR turn to take him to the curb.
He just needs a place to stay until after the election.
I just have a funny feeling that there's something else you have to tell me.
Isn't anyone going to address the people in the room?
Graham dear, do you recall if the lease said anything about pets?
You didn’t get him microchipped?
I assume you're undecided bigly.
No, I don't want a divorce I want to talk about the elephant in the room.
We need to talk about metaphors.
He said he is only hiding here until after the election
We should at least address it.
Yet again nobody said hello, let alone asked the elephant how he was. "I should have been content to roam the savanna, where others paid me heed" the elephant muttered, "rather than suffer this desperate indignity of constantly being ignored".
Is this lamp too small?
Don't mention you know who, it only upsets him.
Told you you'd be sorry for voting for Trump.
"Ok, how about an 8 letter word for 'pachyderm'"!
He won't go outside until the Republicans change their symbol.
I think we should just ignore him.
At least he's quieter than the neighbors' gorilla.
Am I just supposed to ignore the humans in the room?
I guess President Trump wasn't kidding when he said he would increase domestic surveillance.
T. rump
I know you never wantto talk about it, but the rug needs cleaning!
Point taken, I will quit stating the obvious.
What happened to 800 pound gorilla?
You call Barnum, I'll call Bailey
At least it's not pink.
Let's talk about the you-know-what in the you-know-where.
I sure miss the 800-pound gorilla.
You will like him better when you see our next heating bill.
Pretend like you don't know what I'm talking about.
If you think that this is going to influence me in voting for him, you're wrong.
It's your turn to walk him.
Just what exactly am I supposedly ignoring?
The counselor said we can't keep ignoring it.
The memory is great, but I don't like the footprint.
I say we just ignore it.
You were never good at giving subtle hints.
Oh, you're just smelling things
You know those commercials with the sad-eyed shivering elephants you said always break your heart?
Every time you use that expression, I think you make him feel self-conscious.
Half-way through the debate, he just turned around.
Well then what are we supposed to talk about, Todd?
Under the circumstances, I think we should see what we can get for him as a trade-in for a donkey.
You and your stupid cliches.
Listen, Roy, if we're going to keep this thing, let's at LEAST move the chairs toward its head.
Now can we talk about the other elephant in the room?
Can you at least limit the roughage in his diet?
It's just until we know for sure the poachers are gone.
'He's cute,' you said. 'Can I bring him home?' you said. And now look at him.
It's okay... he's a rescue.
I'd actually prefer to have the 800 pound gorilla back.
I thought we stated 'no pets' in our Airbnb listing.
The GOP was having a yard sale to get a new image after Trump?
I always thought the phrase would be as successful with a smaller scale animal.
Your turn to walk him.
He's not lost- He Just Lost- and He Won't Leave!
I've lived with two humans in the room for far too long.
Thank goodness the 100 pound gorilla is no longer in the room.
Why did you have to say she has a wrinkly face? You know she won't forget this.
No, I mean we need to talk about the LITERAL elephant in the room.
It's your turn to take him out.
It says here that some animals escaped from the zoo
It's your turn to walk him and don't forget the poop bag.
It was a metaphor, not a gift hint.
He seems to have lost his Party.
Apparently he saw a clown
Oh, I paid some bills, had lunch with Marge and did some errands.
Damn it, I'm not talking about the elephant! I'm talking about your drinking problem.
I told them they could hide it here until after the election.
I want this elephant out of the room by November 8th.
Stop speaking in metaphors, Roger. What are you really saying?
We also need to talk about the bats in the belfry.
Yes, Roger, I do know the meaning of the word: "literally."
I liked it better when you would blame it on the dog.
Sometimes 'literally' is just 'literally'.
For once can we just NOT talk about the elephant in the room?
Pull the tail for room service.
I don't know what you're talking about.
He's all we ever talk about anymore charlie, I suppose the freakin irony is lost on you ?
The other choice was a bull in a china shop.
When the Republican Party went under, why did you get custody of the mascot?
If you would just support Hillary, we wouldn't have this problem.
Do you smell peanuts?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't want to talk about it.
You'll just have to tell your mother we don't have room for her.
I agree with Jumbo. We need to address the procrastinator in the armchair.
That's a new wrinkle.
This makes it so much easier to bring up your alcoholism.
You're keeping something from me, aren't you?!
"The Macey's ad said they were having a 'Mammoth Sale'".
At least it's not an 800 pound gorilla.
He's lost, poor thing.
I'm just ignoring the two people in the room.
I'd rather discuss getting it OUT of the room.
Is there something you're neglecting to tell me, Stan?
I'm talking about divorce, not the elephant in the room.
I forget what we were talking about.
Did you even notice we have a new rug.
Did you empty the litter box?
It's your turn to empty the litter box.
Yes I still like Governor Chris Christie why do you ask?
The neighbor's tabby Jinx was found flattened in the hallway, who would do such a thing!
Can we talk about something else?
We need a bigger apartment or smaller issues.
Don't tell me who to vote for and I won't tell you where you can stuff your ballot
No, please enlighten me. What is the precise meaning of literally?
Did you notice that nearly half of this cartoon space is devoted to tRUMP?
Are you sure that's everything you wanted to talk about?
Is there something you need to tell me?
I'm not changing my mind and this just reminds me of the giant ass he is.
What was your first clue, Sherlock, that this time it's not metaphorical?
Hon, he wants you to take him for a walk...
I hope he knows we are in the room?
We could ignore it if we had a bigger room.
Honey, what's an eight letter word for a huge grey animal?
Don't forget it's your turn to take him out for a walk.
Great, something else to sweep under the carpet!
It's your turn to walk him.
It's your turn to walk him.
Why didn't we choose the metaphor?
OK, from now on our Airbnb listing will say; no cats, dogs or pachyderms.
You made your point.
He has not left the house since the last debate.
I take it there's something you'd like to talk about?
Put the paper down. We have to talk about the rug.
I mean, if you won't go to counseling, could we at least get a bigger room?
So there really is an elephant in the room!
That's no way to address the elephant in the room.
We're ahead in the polls, was it really necessary to steal their mascot too?
I spoke to our decorator and we are thinking about grey.
You invited him, you get him a drink.
I thought it was just a metaphor.
We have to keep him hidden. Donald Trump wants the tusks to decorate Mara Lago.
There's something we need to talk about.
That's the last time I order a fan, a rope, a hose, and a pillar from FourBlindMen.com!
Not my monkey, not my circus, not my elephant.
I know. But now he's just a euphemism.
Do you think he even notices when we talk like he's not in the room?
I wanted a 400-pound gorilla, but noooo.
Maybe we shouldn't have gotten rid of the mice
Even he doesn't want to talk about it
Ken, I said, "Give her a sedative not a laxative."
He's asked us not to talk about him.
Just ignore it.
Is he house broken?
He forgot your birthday.
No, I'm speaking to the elephant in the room.
Go get the fan.
"What's its name? I'd like to address the elephant in the room.
At times like this, I wish you were a Democrat
He grabbed my peanuts.
If we don't discuss this, then there are two elephants in the room.
This room seemed much bigger when we first bought the house.
I could counter with my donkey, but one jack-ass in the room is already enough!
don't look now but that elephant is back
Oh, no, I'm having that same dream again, with these two weird people in my house.
Animal Control says if you talk about him, he will eventually leave...
I just don't think we're ready to downsize.
He threatened to run away and join the circus.
So... how was work today?
That's it George.....no more rescues!
You still haven't told me what all those peanuts are for.
No, I don't see anything. Why do you ask?
It was supposed to be a metaphor
I tbought you had learned your lesson with that boat in the basement.
Why do you have to be so literal?
I don't think I've ever felt so intimidated by the Republicans.
All right, he can stay, but you're housebreaking him.
It's the eavesdropping that really bothers me.
She says she needed a break from the herd and found us on Airbnb.
Fine, we won't talk about it, but can we talk about its litter box?
Could we at least turn him around?
We can't just sweep it under the rug.
We need to work out the wrinkles.
It's time we addressed the real issue, Jeff: Your obsession with the metaphorical.
But he's for Hillary.
Must you always take everything so literally!
Can we not talk about something else?
Anything else you want me not to think about?
I don't feel like couples counseling is working.
You want to discuss the election NOW??!!
Was there something you wanted to tell me, dear?
Our marriage is one big cliche, Jack.
I thought we agreed: we can get one as long as you clean up after it.
I wonder where I put the remote...
Phew... was that you?
What did you expect when you bought the 25 pound bag of peanuts at Cosco?
Nobody respects elephants more than I do.
Was that thunder I just heard, Angela?
In hindsight, she's hard to ignore.
If we don't talk, it's just going to pile up.
It's the latest thing: the paca-doodle."
I can't find the laxative tablets that I set on the table.
I told you he'd get bigger.
The elephant in the room is that you won't admit there's an elephant in the room.
It's the excrement I can't ignore.
Maybe if we did discuss it, it'll leave.
You know, it's not going to go away just because you don't want to talk about it.
Oh Oh, Grab your shovel, He looks like he is going to take a Trump Dump.
We're going to need a bigger litter box.
I disagree. Metaphors *can* smell bad.
Now can we talk about getting it out of the room?
He just wants to be noticed.
It is embarrassed to leave the house until the election is over.
It won't go away unless we talk about it.
I agreed to let him hide out here from the Trump boys.
No, it's not because I'm a Democrat. I wouldn't want a damned donkey in the house either.
No, Harold, I am not speaking metaphorically. There is literally an elephant in the room.
It feels a little tight, but there's plenty of space in the trunk.
I know you don't want to talk about the you know who in the you know where, but it's your turn to walk him.
Unbelievable! They refuse to acknowledge me.
I still want to exchange him for a donkey.
She's pregnant.
Don't you think it's time we discussed the election?
Well, what DO you want to talk about?
Read quickly. Jumbo's paper trained.
We have to get up. He wants to turn around.
Shall we talk about the cliche in the room.
who farted?
Did you just fart?
We should have gone with fly in the ointment.
Don't blame me! I tried to tell you he's going to grow up.
You really don't know what we need to discuss?
Can we please talk about something else?
He's too ashamed to go out in public since Trump.
That's the problem with one-click shopping and overnight delivery-- no time to plan for the consequences.
We're gonna need a bigger room.
I told you we should have voted Democratic.
I don't know what you're talking about.
After the parade he doesn't come back, right?
Last night I heard her talking about the people in the room.
What - you'd prefer a donkey in the room?
What's that smell?
You're sure there's no notice about a lost elephant in the classifieds? Check again.
I don't want to talk about it.
Can we please talk about something else?
Yes, this is the rescue animal, Fluffy, I spoke of....
There's a poppy seed on your tooth.
The campaign souvenirs have to go.
Go see how he filled the other room.
We should tell him that Trump is gone forever now so he can go outside again.
You never want to talk about it.
He's pouting because no one will address the elephant in the room.
Why does it insist on ignoring us?
So what did you want to talk about?
Just paint the walls gray and maybe he'll blend in.
It feels so spacious now that his kids left
Regardless of what happened in college, Richard, my feelings about threesomes aren't going to change now.
Could we please discuss something besides politics for a change?
Dear are you sure Donald has sent one to everybody who made a GOP campaign contribution?
I have no idea what you're talking about
It’s definitely your turn to clean out the litter tray
'Can we talk about something else for a change?'
Don't worry, he is on his way out
I do so smell gas.
Are you sure you checked the Lost & Found section?
OK, you proved your point. There are some elephants in the room that people will talk about.
Do you know what will happen when he loses?
Hasn't this tif with the condo association gone far enough?
How come we never talk about the one ounce canary in the room?
Okay, Harold! We've been avoiding this for too long!
Well, at least he's not white.
And the best part is he's already housebroken.
I'm switching parties.
He should go to a red state where he belongs.
Our unspoken agreement covered the 800 pound gorilla. We can't dance around this one.
Is this really the best way to tell me you know about the affair?
We can't put off talking about your party registration any longer.
Frankly? I am tired of the footprints in the Jello.
I told you to back it in.
No. Nothing comes to mind.
Say you're sorry.
No, it's your turn to clean the litter box.
It's even harder to ignore when it's passing gas.
I won't mention it, if you don't.
I need to address the elephant in the room. What's his name again?
What can we do? He's hiding from Donald Trump.
No, it's your turn to empty the litter.
You've made your point. Now get him out of here.
Now this is the grey I want for the living room.
Actually, running away and joining the circus isn't a terrible idea.
The interior decorator said it's a conversation piece.
Well, I guess we all know how you're going to vote
We need to talk about how things have gotten way too literal.
It's a no-conversation piece.
He got voted out of the zoo.
O.K., this is me being 'literal'. We need to talk
Ugh! That fly is a nuisance.
I've been meaning to talk to you about Fluffy.
We could move it to a room in the back while they make the Party great again
Too bad we chose natural gas over natural light.
Did you smell that?
Because the rabbi suggested it.
She might forgive, but she'll never forget.
If we ignore it, I think it will go away.
I'm allergic to cats.
Well we can't leave him outside, this is a progressive area
I can't ignore it any longer—we've got to get an air freshener.
Are you ready to talk about the Republican in the room?
No, I didn't say the litter box is in the garage now. I said the garage now is the litter box.
Now I get it.
Me not Jane; you not Tarzan!
You are ignoring the fact he is the biggest ass in the room.
I know there is an elephant in the room, but is it Asian or African?
Honey, it's hard to ignore the elephant in the room when he's spouting nonsense and running for president.
I'm beginning to miss the 800-pound gorilla.
Why are we not discussing this!?
It's your turn to walk him.
He won't look at us since he forgot our anniversary.
We might lose the security deposit.
Are you wearing a new cologne?
You might need to look at it from my perspective.
The SPCA found him in the Trump Tower lobby.
I think we need to stop shopping at Whole Foods.
Do I smell gas?
I don' want to talk about him when he' standing right there.
You THINK she has IBS?
We need to talk about the palpable sexual tension between us.
So, how was your day, Honey?
It's the latest Trump mailer--they're getting desperate.
It's not going anywhere till you start talking.
He's trying to ignore the people in the room.
No one every talks about the smell!
You wanted a pet. . . you clean up after him.
Let's talk about the carpet in the room.
Was that thunder or does Elsie have the tummy rumbles?
You said it was only a metaphor.
Put down that paper, get his leash and take him for a walk before he goes on the carpet again!
We used to talk about everything
Oh, Robert, must you dredge up these tired cliches?
Its your turn to take him out
So..... is there something you want to tell me?
I got it at Harrods honey. Yank on it's tail and the light goes off.
Alright! Sorry I misunderstood you when you said you wanted to tickle the ivories!
What's that expression for an obvious thing that nobody talks about?
Then what ELSE shall we talk about?
But on the other hand, the flowers in the meadow should be rather spectacular this summer.
We've been ignoring it for years, Mort. It just won't go away!
Put the paper down. Don't ignore the Janet in the room.
Honey, I feel like there's something you're forgetting to tell me.
Just keep doing it. It worked for the gorilla.
Anyway, it's less expensive than going on a safari
Alright, then let's talk about the lizard in the dishwasher.
No. You go first!
Honey, does this actually make you a better Republican?
Okay, okay....we can talk about who you're voting for.
'It's your turn to clean the litter box'
Do you really think we'll be rid of him after Nov. 8th?
We'd both like it if you stopped calling things you don't like "irrelephant."
You've simply gone too far to defend your usage of the word "literally."
Your turn to take him outside
Why do we always have to talk about him?
I haven't seen our 800 pound gorilla all day.
For goodness' sake, Harold, put that paper down. You're blocking the light!
I'll need that section for his paper training when you're done.
On the bright side, he's teaching me pilates.
Just so you know. I'm not walking him.
Screw it, I'm going to talk about it.
I think it's about time we addressed the obvious, Frank... Did you wear that same shirt yesterday?
Because it hurts his feelings when we talk about him--that's why.
But I always thought it was just an expression!
Do you think this rug is Indian or African?
He ate the thousand pound Gorilla.
Noah called and said we could bring one guest.
No, right now I'm talking about the man reading the newspaper in the room!
Do we bill AirBnb or the Republican party?
Did you remember to go to your AA meeting this week?
Would you believe it's voting for Hillary?
I guess when you donate a generous amount, the gifts really do increase as well.
I hope you thought to buy a shovel, too.
It's gonna take a lot of kitty litter
Fine, I get it. You're "Not With Her".
He must think we are the proverbial couple who just sit around all day.
He used to be the GOP mascot but decided on a change of career.
If we talk about it, will it leave?
He would have been poached if I didn't take him.
Humor me Jim. Just walk directly over to the other side of the room and then back, and tell me about the experience.
It's your turn to clean out the litter box.
Notice what ?
It's your turn to walk him.
Just locker room talk, dear. It doesn't count.
Ignoring the problem, only makes it bigger.
Do you want to talk about it?
Bet you’ll know it’s in the room when you have to clean up after it.
I didn't mean it literally, Todd.
I have a feeling something bad is about to happen
Well, you're a man. I guess it wouldn't be obvious to you.
You can't tell me anymore the floor can't hold up under a tiny weeny pool table.
We gonna talk about what's on the dining room rug?
Perhaps a bigger light bulb would be helpful.
That's the last time I click on "Adopt An Endangered Animal."
So I'm guessing that either you cheated on me, or that's a real elephant.
He followed me home. You know how I get with strays.
Outside again? I told you not to eat so many peanuts.
Then tell me who Patty is, Harold!
He can't find his party.
We need to talk.
I will really be glad when the election is over!
My mother called.
It doesn't go with the rug.
I walked him this morning.
Why is it that you never want to discuss the gorilla in the bedroom?
Still think your vote doesn't matter?
In my dream a donkey swallows him whole, and we regain control of the house.
You still haven't told me who you're voting for.
How long are we going to avoid talking about getting a bigger room?
Put the paper down for a sec.
It's your turn to clean the litter box.
It really does look like Trump is the new face of the Republican Party.
When I said "Dump Trump," I didn't mean in our living room!
What do you mean "What elephant?"?
'Don't you dare say it.'
I find it easier to ignore him than an 800 pound gorilla.
Seventeen letters; unseen nemesis??
If we don't talk about him, does he exist?
Dear, Is there something we're avoiding?
We need to talk.
So, how is this better that the gorilla in the room?
She's left the Republican Party and decided to join the circus.
So the pet shop clerk asks: By any chance is this 'birthday boy' you speak of a Republican?
There's something big I've been meaning to talk to you about.
Seriously...? We're not going to talk about it?
Why so secretive? Just tell me who you're voting for.
Just because he is here does not mean that I am going to stop talking about the other elephant in the room.
Lets address this before it gets any bigger
Says he is looking for a party.
I think we should discuss the Republican in the room.
I don't mind the poop, it's that groping trunk.
I told you we should have gotten the donkey.
A cat would have been fine.
I'm looking forward to him moving out Nov. 9th...
I don't want to talk about the elephant in the room. I want to talk about what's wrong with our marriage.
Bubbles needs a bathroom break Walt.
It's your turn to walk him.
Still think I misused the word "literally" for dramatic effect?
I have a hard time visualizing Trump's base.
The decorator said it was jungle motif!
He didn't forget YOUR birthday!
Must you bring your work home from the zoo?
I told you not to trust photos on eBay.
I'm still voting for Hillary
Telling Albert "go big or go home" isn't being helpful, dear.
Anything for 'former circus star'?......
No more speaking metaphorically, Hubert. There is an elephant in the room.
There was one significant topic the de Brunhoffs rarely discussed
Your turn to run the sweeper.
I finally understand how Canada feels.
The doctor seems really optimistic about pet therapy.
I liked the gorilla better.
Looks like the 400 lb. gorilla called in sick again.
Who knew you'd receive such a grand retirement bonus from the zoo?
Keep reading if you must. But it's in the room....
It's your turn. I walked him this afternoon.
Can we at least talk about the air quality?
A typical politician, the public face a blowhard and the other end-full of crap!
The rug in the room, is it Indian or African?
No more house-sitting for the Ringleys.
Don't get mad at.him. He forgets where the box is.
Is there something you'd like to talk about?
John, we need to talk about the metaphor in the room.
We acknowledged. Now what?
No, you bring it up.
Politics today is devoid of decency, civility, serious policy discussion, and subtle, non-literal figures of speech.
If you would only address it, we would have so much more space.
So are we just not going to talk about your plans to vote Republican in the next election?
I have this feeling the end is near
No, I wanted the matching couch and loveseat, you're the one that insisted on the metaphorical idiom.
Mother warned me about marrying a Hannibal.
I like the ones who weren't captured.
They said it was just until they got their party back together.
My mother wears a size 14. Why do you ask?
You did get the XXXL broom, right?
Can you at least admit her presence ?
My psychologist suggested I bring him home... Let's talk about our sex life Frank.
He's a Grand Old Party pooper.
That's too literal a metaphor, doncha think?
He's the only thing we ever talk about.
He's hiding from Donald.
Look out! He's going to take a Drumpf!
The elephant in the room is in the room.
How did you get her on the elevator?
Fostering abandoned animals for the local ASPCA is a worthy project but I really think they're taking advantage of us.
Poor thing was frightened by an orange-haired orangutan.
If you say--It's the elephant in the room--one more time, I'm leaving.
Well, we can't ignore him any longer--we're out of kitty litter.
What do you mean, 'Things have a way of working themselves out?'
I see you're still leaning toward voting Republican.
Please tell me the Dems can take back the house this year.
These reminders to vote sure have gotten insistent.
So...because the Klinemans got a Great Dane, you had to one-up them again?
Do you ever wonder where he poops?
It's your turn to take him for a walk.
I thought it was just a figure of speech.
Well, that's funny. All these years I've been thinking you were the one who was uncomfortable talking about it.
You've taken your interest in the Republican Party too far.
You're sure it's just full of hot air?
It's so hard to keep a flying carpet on the ground.
I was thinking of a golden retriever.
Did you see that the pork roast is 10% off at Costco.
Can you believe the airlines turned down my service animal request again?
I looked a gift horse in the mouth, led another one to water, then finally decided to go with Jumbo here.
Let's not litigate it. What's dung is dung.
Fred, it's your turn: he needs to go out.
Does this elephant make me look fat?
He keeps his backside to the TV. Can't stand to watch the news.
I'm talking about your gambling. What did you think I meant?
You're voting for Hillary, right?
I think it's better if we don't talk about it.
T-rump
Are you blind Henry? It's YUGE.
We're out of peanuts again
They can have their mascot back after the election.
With the polls as they are, a GOP yard sign just wasn't enough to swing things.
Not to worry. Next week we get the donkey.
Did you clean the box?
Do you think the end is in sight?
Was there something you wanted to talk about?
If I were you I'd stop obsessing about the 800-pound gorilla.
He won't go outside until it's all over.
I have a strong feeling that there's something big that we're not seeing.
The Grimshaws have a champion poodle, the Wainrights have an albino ferret, the Russos raise exotic tropical fish. If I had known you were this competitive I never would have married you.
What are you thinking about?
You NEVER want to talk about it.
I didn't put my party's symbol in here because you're already such an ass.
I'm not talking about it.
You know, it's awkward for me too, you guys.
Well, at least the lawn looks good.
Oh yeah, now I remember!!
Really? Where are you going to put the litter box?
He's hiding here until the post-election stuff blows over.
Just ignore him.
Nancy, I told you, when my circus takes off we'll buy a bigger place.
I don't see him either but it's your turn to clean it up.
Nice try, but Trump is still the biggest ass to represent the republican party.
I don't care if he is the last member of his party, in November he has to go.
Must you always state the obvious?
Couldn't we talk about something else for a change?
I know he's a symbol and I appreciate all the trouble you've gone to but I cannot, will not vote for that man!
I think there's bigger things in the room to talk about if that tail goes up!
No big news?
Surely, this isn't what they meant by "Adopt-an-Elephant!"
just another big ass republican taking over the room
The room just seems smaller since we traded in the couch.
He didn't like the verbally abusive ringmaster.
Just a reminder.....measure twice, adopt once.
I don't see it, I can't find it, I don't know what you are talking about...
Not to bring up the lamp in the room, but...
Oh, look! The paper says the Circus is in town!
I think he ignores us on purpose.
Thanks for letting me stop by. It's a jungle out there this time of year
Sometimes I feel like our marriage is one big clichè.
If you don't want to talk about it, fine. I just don't want us to be accused of having started some metaphorical idiom.
It does take the fun out of being a Republican.
This editorial really brings the metaphor to life
Fine. Finish the paper before walking him. But if he has another accident, you’re cleaning it up.
No, it's YOUR turn to walk him.
I've had enough, we are getting a mouse!
Must you always bring up the obvious.
They were out of Gorillas
I don't want to talk about it.
Well, he's definitely not getting a good review on Airbnb.
And then there's the smell. You can't pretend you don't smell that.
First it was the footprints in the butter, now the broken fence...
You know...hon...today's my birthday...
I don't know what to tell you, Stew, the Health Department wouldn't sign off on the donkey.
We just never talk about it.
What will it take to get your attention?
Honey, we have to quit the party.
I wanted a bird in the hand, but you said, 'let's think big!'
We need to talk about what happened to the gorilla.
What about the no pet clause?
You are taking your loyalty to the Republican Party too far!
I am just going to say it, there's an elephant in the room.
It's your birthday wish from 1982.
Well, are we going to address the elephant in the room?
I'm praying that he's house broken!
Can we please talk about something *besides* the elephant in the room?
When you say that we can't keep ignoring him, you're referring to the elephant right?
It's just until after the election.
We used to be able to talk about anything.
You know he doesn't like it when you talk about the size of his ears.
I don't care if his name is idiom, metaphor or cliche, I want him out of my house!
Good idea, but do they make the kind of litter boxes we're gonna need?
And they delivered it in less than an hour!
Isn't it obvious?
Ok, Honey, what's bothering you?
Honey, can you tickle the ivory one more time?
What's that smell?
We'll tell him he's adopted next year.
Sydney, don't worry, he's only staying till the 9th.
And as head of the Auburn Alumni Committee, you thought stealing their mascot was a good idea? I mean, if it were a cat or a duck i might be on board, but this!
I don't have any idea what you're talking about.
I thought this would help mask the metaphorical version.
Nothing to talk about?
Let's agree to ignore this.
So when is your mother coming to visit?
You want to keep that thing, you go hire Mike Pence to clean up behind it!
You've referred to it many times. Now it's here. So what. .
How many times do I have to tell you that it is bigger than both of us!
Look, the deal we made when Mittens was alive is still in force: I buy the litter and you clean out the box.
Let's not talk about it.
She is not! Mama's just big boned.
Honest to God, I'm sick of it! Can't we discuss something else in the room?
"Elephant? What elephant?
You better move...Trump's about to speak again.
He reminds me of an older you.
Again...blocking my light.
No, it's your turn to change the litter box.
Nothing we've talked about can leave this room.
I would prefer a donkey in the room.
Honey, put the paper down quickly! On the floor to your left. Just do it, OK?
If you would just seal that gap under the garage door ,we would not have this problem !
Did you have a post-election plan for him?
Ignore him. He just wants attention.
Should we talk about who's coming for Thanksgiving?
Really? That wasn't you?!
I wish we could talk about the mouse in the room instead.
The elephant in the room is the elephant in the room.
Can you think of an eight-letter word beginning with "e" and ending with "nt" besides "erumpent"? /
Honey, your call. We can either talk now, or tomorrow it’s the 800-pound gorilla.
Even the elephant in the room is left-leaning.
I know, right? And fifty per cent off, too!
You can keep on ignoring it, but I still think it's a problem we have to discuss.
Eventually we'll have to talk about it!
Well, can't we at least talk about this?
I know, I know, but can we please talk about something else for a change?
And then there's the litter box!
Ignoring doesn't seem to be working!
When I said you could bring home a souvenir from your safari trip, I was thinking a hat.
I'm not being figurative. Look up.
Isn't your turn to take him out for a walk?
I'm not going to state the obvious, but christ, what an a**hole
I think he has to go out
The elephant in the room is the elephant in the room.
I still say our relationship needs more space.
Of course you don't see it.
Why couldn't you just get curtains?
The fact that we prefer not to see you twerk doesn't mean we don't love you.
Honestly Ed, you've let this Republican thing get out of hand.
I know we wanted to make a strong political statement, but in hindsight......
I've just got a lot on my rug right now.
Do you think NOW might be the time to talk about it?
He's not going to be IGNORED, Dan!
Well, what do ya know? This ironic elephant is ignoring us.
I'm with her!!!
I think the big elephant in the room is the big elephant in the room.
Why, again, is it so important that the carpet doesn't roll up on the edges?
Did you pack his trunk?
Yes, everything is fine. Why do you ask?
Our therapist said we're supposed to talk to it.
I'm just saying, I do not think probosciuity should not hinder anyone from becoming president.
Now do you want to talk?"
I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, now is never a good time for you.
He's here for the piano
Can't you at least acknowledge the elephant in the room?
Relax! If he's not house trained I'll take him back to SPCA
Must you always be so literal when we argue?
Oh Yeah!? Then you clean his litter box.
Nobody puts Baby in a corner.
But you promised; no more rescue animals.
Sorry, but he wouldn't fit in the basket with the other deplorables.
Luckily, "into the lion's den" wasn't a metaphor that Tom was familiar with.
Ok, so you're not speaking ,metaphorically.
Oh nothing. What's new with you?
Are you going to say something or shall I?
I feel like we're forgetting something.....
He won't go out. He's afraid he'll run into a nasty woman.
Darling, on the donation check, did you write 'pac' or 'pachyderm'?
I know you want people to know your still a Republican, but this is ridiculous.
He says he'll never forget he once lived here.
Oh sure, ignore me and talk to the elephant. Ask him why he's in the room Albert! Why is he in the room?
'This time, I ride and you shovel."
Your concern about ivory poachers has gone too far!
Okay I guess, but only until he turns to his left.
Let me guess, you want a penny for my thoughts?
That is NOT the elephant in the room I'm talking about!
He's not voting for Trump either.
Are we missing something?
There's something I need to bring up...
Why does it always have to be 'the elephant in the room'? Why can't it be, say, 'the impala in the room'?
I get the feeling that you're not telling me something.
He hates it when we talk about him.
You're right, it's better than the gorilla.
No. Why?
I'm not ignoring it, I'm giving it the cold shoulder.
This is not what I meant when I said 'African Decor.'
You can ignore me by reading the paper, but you can't ignore him.
honey, no offense but i just bathed the elephant, so i know its not her.....but you smell
We need to talk about the elephant in the room -- I hate this rug.
Either we talk about it or you are going to clean up.
'Do you think ears are for show? I CAN HEAR YOU!'
Keep quiet dear, he doesn't know he is here.
I think it's time we talked about you know what
Honey, I don't want to adopt again. There. I said it.
I think the landlord's getting suspicious.
It's your turn to clean up.
You can call it a cliché if you want but I still think we have to discuss it.
The vet called. He says it's going to be quintuplets.
Well, Gary, we might as well address it now. Is he up to date on his shots?
This is a good example, but I still don't think that 'bigly' is a real word.
I think we need to think outside of the room.
No, I don't want to talk about it.
You can't be serious.
I told you these chairs would crowd the room.
I said "elephant ear plant," not "plant elephant here."
You have a fly on your forehead.
Your turn to walk him.
I think he wants to go out.
Let's not even discuss it.
It seems that our 'little girl' was in the neighbor's Petunia bed again!
If I agree not to ask how he got in, could I at least ask how he will get out?
If you’re not crazy about this idea, you’re really going to hate the tiger in the backyard.
Well, Ethan's frenemy had a trapeze artist at his birthday party, and things just sort of escalated from there.
It's existential. It's a gray area. It's too big to get my head around.
Its only for the weekend.
Well, if we're not going to talk about it, we need a bigger room.
I don't want to talk about the fact that there is literally an elephant in the room.
Where is that 800-pound gorilla when we need him?
I was speaking metaphorically! Now take him back to the zoo
If Trump wins he'll be packing his trunk!
All you ever want to talk about is the elephant in the room!
I forgot what I was going to say.
I could have sworn I put the bowl of peanuts on this table.
Did I mention I found mice droppings in the kitchen this afternoon?
But in this case, Henry, the 'elephant in the room" is, in fact, an elephant.
It's your turn to walk him,
She's upset because the neighbor's hyena said the color gray makes her look fat.
I thought you said our daughter has a dumb beau.
Its your turn to walk him.
Why can't you just forget about it?
I think we need to talk about this in another room.
Just when you are trying to distance yourself from the other party!
He feels like there's no room to grow in this relationship.
Is it my imagination or has the GOP gotten a little...smelly?
I always assumed it represented your fascination with Internet porn, but now you're saying we've been living with an actual elephant in the room all these years?
It’s just for two days.
I'd rather not discuss it.
It's your turn to take her for a walk.
Trust me, dung is the fuel of the future.
I'm not voting Republican, George, and this power of suggestion thing is not going to work.
He's only staying here until his party returns to normal.
I preferred the campaign promise of 'a chicken in every pot' to what this 2016 election delivered.
Did you have to feed him beans?!!
Just what we need, an elephant with a peanut allergy.
Be honest -- does this room make my butt look big?
The elephant? It's a free gift for everyone who votes.
It's either Tiny or me!
I'd rather ignore the donkey in the room... it's the lesser of two evils.
I hate self-fulfilling idioms.
All right, now let's try ignoring it again.
We've ignored talking about it for years. Why start now?
Have you Googled 'Elephant removal?'
I've been cleaning all day.
Hard not to state the obvious.
Hey, you're the one who wanted to go to therapy.
I just know there's something you're not telling me.
He can stay, you need to go.
And the same thing will happen if I mention the 800lb gorilla?
OK Harry. I agree it's gotten out of hand. He goes but only AFTER you get rid of the donkey.
I have only to say "sit" and the argument is over - for good.
Do you think the elephant in the room is actually the elephant in the room?
OK, OK, already.......I get it.
My therapist thinks it will help.
Joe, we just can't afford the peanuts anymore
Well he said, " It's going to be huge, HUGE! "
Why? Does she ever talk about us?
If you don't take him out for a walk, we will likely lose the dining room!
Nothing is going to change. I'll still be the one you ignore.
It seemed like a great deal at the trunk show
Literally.
It's not if--it's when.
You see honey, now we never have to talk about our real issues.
It's just an expression.
When do the creepy clowns arrive?
All we ever talk about is the elephant in the room
Don't say it.
Can we discuss the people in the room
I adopted him as a therapy pet to help my early memory loss.
The six blind men are gone, but we both know there's still a problem.
Does this light make my butt look big?
How can we move when our rent is peanuts?
I can't believe he forgot our anniversary.
Let's not talk about it.
Our son used to be a closet Republican. No more.
'Okay, and we won't talk about the loser in the room either.'
It's a metaphor, Charles, a metaphor!
It's not like you can just sweep this one under the rug.
Just once I wish you'd resist saying the obvious.
Another super delegate, another pile of crap.
Have you noticed a faint odor of peanuts in the room?
Don't worry, it's just a Trump l'oeil.
So I suppose you expect me to walk him like the last elephant?
First an 800 pound gorilla in the room, now an elephant. Can't we just talk to each other?
I don't see the gorilla, and the bull's in the shop.
It's your mother back to haunt us.
I don't know. Where did you last see the leash?
Hold it in, Fred. This is your big chance to really impress them and finally make partner. Don't take a massive dump on the rug. You got this.
You left the garage door open again.
Can we please not talk about it?
He wants his girlfriend to move in.
Is there something we should be talking about?
Can we talk about something else for a change?
Just ignore it.
Oh, so you want to talk about the elephant in the room now, but not when our therapist asks about it?
And he thought miss universe needed to lose weight...
Elephant? What elephant?
Do you smell it, too?
Some things are better left unsaid.
He's trying his best to be inconspicuous.
Why is it that every time I want to discuss something important, you want to talk about the elephant?
Who's going to tell Donald it's all over?
His poop is worse than his bite.
I don't understand why we need to talk about it at all.
. . . which reminds me of a cliché.
He's got an allergy to what?
We can talk about it or we can move.
Don't worry, he'll move out on 9 November
John we've been married 35 years I think we should talk about the elephant in the room
What do you mean, we're not going to talk about it?
Do you think he'll leave on November 9th?
There is nothing to discuss!
Not much. I had some time to kill, so I stopped by the pet store.
Nobody in this room is voting for Trump.
Never tell an elephant he's hung like a horse.
It's your turn to let him sit in your lap.
I'll be so glad when the election's over.
But what if "the elephant in the room" is actually an elephant IN THE ROOM!
That inflatable beast will go in our yard over my dead body.
Isn't it obvious? She's upset he called her a fatso.
I appreciate your extended analysis of my evolving sex drive, Harry, but I was referring to the actual elephant.
Sure, it's housebroken, but I'm more worried about a broken house.
I'm worried about that too, but I think we'd have to feed it first.
Why do we have to talk about it? Can't we just get it out of here?
I know you addressed it, but that didn't make it go away.
I am mostly worried that our cleaning lady will quit.
Your choice, get the peanuts or get the shovel
No, ignoring it will not just make it go away...
There was no elephant in the room before we started discussing one.
It's a thoughtless gift. I'm a democrat.
Do you remember what we were talking about?
No, nothing's wrong. Why do you ask?
Call the mahout, Dear; I think she needs to go for a walk.
Do you smell peanuts ?
Anything else new?
I cannot believe these people are acting like they can't see me!
Once he's potty trained you'll barely notice him
What's your cat's name?
It's just not what I had in mind when I agreed to adopt a "rescue".
Even if I agree to take down the yard sign?
I did look at puppies! But he was so cute.
Oh, I don’t know, Karl – what do YOU want to talk about?
The GOP has more troubles than I thought.
How 'bout them Cubs?
You are absolutely sure nothing is wrong?
What makes you think I'm hiding something?
You're the dumbo.
I think a donkey would restore some balance.
I told you, they become very big.
Honestly? I'd rather have you make mountains out of molehills.
I'm not being figurative.
You and your damn cliches.
The elephant in the room is this elephant in the room.
This I can tell you, whatever the lying media may say, that elephant is huge.
We need a bigger living room.
Putin wants out.
All right, I'll walk him this week, but you have to clean up.
Give me one good reason why I can't have a mouse.
Can we discuss the elephant in the room?
I once heard a bit of advice that I thought was absolutely ridiculous until now: "When playing musical chairs with an elephant, let the elephant win."
Do you smell peanuts?
We're gonna need more kitty litter.
So are we going to address this lamp in the room? My pet elephant doesn't like the lamp.
"Lets return it and get the donkey........its litter box trained".
You'd better show him where you put the litter box.
I think he'll go away if we stop paying him any more attention.
Should we discuss the lamp in the room?
At least everything is out in the open now.
At this point I think we have to do more than just talk about it.
I had an urge to tickle the ivory, okay?
I knew there was a reason this timeshare was so cheap.
Honestly, I've never felt closer to you.
You can ignore him all you want but it is your turn to walk the elephant.
Hurry and check Classifieds and see if anyone's missing something obvious.
Well, we'll soon know if it is real.......the people below will start complaining.
remember the last time we waited to walk him?
I think its time to talk about how our apartment just isn't big enough for you to help all stray animals.
Don't mind him, eventually we'll sweep him under the carpet
Your first safari too?
Don't talk about it.
I'm getting sick and tired of being called The Queen of Denial!
Which "elephant in the room" are you talking about?
Um, is there something we need to talk about?
i don't see the problem.
The jackass in in the other room, we’re still undecided.
Two weeks BEFORE the Election and the party is already asking us to store this?!?
So, how was your day?
A rather bold move to show your support don't you think?
You know very well the elephant in this room is that bimbo you call a secretary!
Well, I'm not going to say it either.
Bill. I want a divorce.
He's on loan from the RNC. Can we keep him?
I'm pretty sure he's talking about us, too.
Don't look so surprised, dear. We need to talk.
He wants to go out.
I can't wait till this election is finally over and it will be the three of us again!
That's not the end of the election process I'd like to discuss.
You get her leash and I'll follow behind in the front end loader.
Well, you'd think he would remember the way out.
Morton has always been very concrete with his metaphors.
He absolutely denies ever being in a room.
John, do I need to tell you this relationship isn't working?
Are you going to continue to pretend that it's not there?
Define 'room.'
She always ignores the people in the room.
I think My mind is being taken over by this election....
There's an old cliche that needs to be discussed immediately.
And how 'bout this lovely fall weather we've been having!
No, I said try not to think about an elephant.
He's 18 now. We can't make him stay.
If you're not going to talk about it, can you at least put the paper under it when you're done?
We just have to discuss...the Cubs being in the World Series.
NO! You squeeze the toothpaste wrong!
I told you not to check into a Trump hotel before the election.
I made him a dinner he never forgot
What did you say you want to talk about?
I'm leaving you.
Your party loyalty is getting out of hand.
Just thought I'd test your ability to ignore things.
That rug really ties the room together.
Lets name him Metaphor
No... I mean the real elephant in the room
Cute... but, we're Democrats.
Nice weather we're having.
Can't you even consider the possibility that it's not a stray and someone might be looking for it?
Let's ignore the Republican in the room.
I forgot what I was going to say.
I'm just happy we're talking about it.
Let's not talk politics tonight.
The elephant in the room is the elephant in the room.
I remember when he was a cute baby elephant.
Out of the room November 8.
No, I don't think he got in through the pet door.
And nearby hangs a tail.
We have acknowledged the elephant in the room, now, the question is who is taking him out for a walk
But Frank, there must be a more efficient way to prevent poaching.
We know it's a circus but this is ridiculous.
A Trumpet could mean a bowel movement. Let's get out of here.
But dear, I got him for you. You said you are dung hoe about gardening.
He promises to leave on Wednesday.
No, he can't sit anywhere he wants. He isn't an 800 pound gorilla
Is there something you're not telling me?
I feel we really need to talk about something but I can't remember what it is.
No,really,we have to talk about it.
It's just a saying, you know.
I thought we agreed not to talk politics!
No, I'm pretty sure we've covered everything.
I've told you three times--*nothing's* the matter.
I say we put a big sectional sofa in here! That way we can both stretch out. They can deliver it Tuesday the 8th which is perfect because there is nothing important going on.
I had to give her a time out.
Guess what?" "Elephant butt!
Do you have to be so subtle about my mom coming to stay for a month?
I'd rather not discuss it.
As a woman, I really feel the GOP candidate is violating my personal space
It's your turn to clean the litter box.
Would you have preferred the 800 lb. gorilla?
I'll be glad when this election's over.
I felt sorry for him. He said his life was a circus.
All we ever talk about is the elephant in the room.
That Really Tied the Room Together
Sure, we have some problems but I never thought it was a big deal.
No, why do you ask?
But we're independents. Is this supposed to help us decide?
If you had registered as a democrat like I asked,we wouldn't have this problem!
It's time I told you, Clyde; Jumbo is not really your son.
I don't care if he is endangered. This isn't an ark, and you aren't Noah.
He was on sale from Ringling Brothers.
Well, it's better than a skeleton in the closet.
I don't care if he did follow you home, you can't keep him.
I thought you said it was just an expression!" " I thought you said it was just an expression!
I know you don't want to talk about it, but ...
NOW will you talk about the elephant in the room?
You're more than a little behind.
Are we also not talking about clean-up duty?
Alls I know is Airbnb said it was in Dumbo.
It's getting harder and harder to ignore.
I want a divorce
Well they certainly don't promote the fact that the b's in Airbnb stand for Barnum & Bailey.
Darling, we seem to be out of vodka.
The Republicans could have just mailed us a voting guide, instead.
You're sleeping with my sister and the elephant in the room?!
Peter, your drinking seems to be getting out of hand.
Just this once maybe we can talk about something other than Donald Trump.
Yes, I know we have to talk about it!
I don't want to talk about it.
I think you know what we need to talk about.
There is nothing you can do that will convince me to vote Republican this year.
Nice try, but we're still going to talk about you voting for Trump.
His memory is unbelievable but very selective....he can recall 2000 & 2004 in great detail. But 2008 & 2012--nada.
No, I don't think you drink too much.
Finally, the elephant in the room, IS "The Elephant In The Room"
The vet says he and the donkey will perk up after the election.
I heard it's leaving on November the 8th.
"Elephant in the room?" If I had a nickel every time I've heard that.
'I can't wait for this election cycle to end...'
I'm getting this eerie feeling that you're not telling me something.
How many times must I remind you to call the exterminator?
It's not a cliche when it's literally true
It's hard to ignore the Republicans in the room.
Why do you always take everything I say so literally?
And that donkey you swept under the rug--are they house trained?
I don't think that witness protection is working for the GOP.
He made the elephant great again!
Don't even mention it!
He's been sulking ever since the convention.
Just LOVE what you've done to the place!
What we need to address is who's going to clean his litter box?
His name is Donald
No! I said I don't want to talk about it!
Did you remember to vote?
But honey, they stole our donkey.
Looks like the GOP circus is in town.
Honey, is this your way of telling me you're going to vote for the Republican candidate?
Really, Frank? You don't even smell it?
I'm teaching him how to wipe his feet.
I know you’re nonpartisan – don't get a donkey.
I feel like there's something we need to discuss.
See?...THAT'S the difference between donkey and ass!
You staring at me like that is extremely distracting.
I much preferred the gorilla.
We've been talking about it for months and it hasn't gone away.
Our lack of intimacy is not the proverbial elephant in the room that needs discussing!
My family? I thought he was yours.
The circus was in town. End of discussion.
Never send an elephant to do a Donkey's job
The suspense is killing me.
OK, he can stay tonight, but tomorrow he's got to find a new party to represent.
What do you mean "What elephant?" He's been standing there for thirty years.
You're ignoring the Republican in the room
I'm pretty sure it will be gone for good the day after the election!
Okay! You win! I admit there's an elephant in the room.
I really don't think there's anything we haven't talked about honey!
He doesn't let on we're even in the room!
Let's talk about it tomorrow.
Sometimes we should ignore our therapist's ideas.
Something you wanna talk about?
Is it close in here or is it just me?
He's ashamed to show his face.
You're a Republican, act like it.
Honey, let's quit the bnb listings.
Fine. I grant you that there's no more mouse problem.
No I would not prefer your mother moving in!
How’s that pooper-scooper law looking now?
What!? You can't miss it. It's on my right and your left.
Isn't that a figurative, not literal, expression?
Can you at least acknowledge there's no air freshener in the room?
The Trump in the room.
I can't wait until the election is over.
Once again, you are going to leave it to me to address the elephant in the room
Stay alert. She always rolls to the right.
For God's sake Harold, he didn't JUST follow you home!
I prefer not to talk about it.
For once, let’s talk about the real elephant in the room. Are you seriously voting for Trump?
Don't throw that paper away. I need it for his crate.
The Republicans are still in a time out, I see.
I don't want to talk about it.
All we ever do is talk, talk, talk about it!
Okay...Truth be told...He followed me home from our honeymoon...Are you even listening to me?
Ordinarily I'd agree, but there actually IS an elephant in the room.
I really thought he'd leave after the election.
How about a trunk sale?
He still takes less room than Donald Trump.
God help us if she eliminates.
I smell gas!
Subletting to the director of the zoo was not a good idea.
Supporting the Republicans is one thing dear, this is another
Your turn to take him out. DON'T FORGET THE SHOVEL!
Ignore it all you want, but it won't be gone unti November 9th.
He's just waiting to be acknowledged.
Well, I'll give you a hint: It's not the lamp in the room that we should probably talk about.
When are we going to discuss the ass in the room?
Of course he's depressed - he knows he has to vote for Hillary.
What elephant in the room?
So...we're not going to talk about her, but can we do something about the damn smell?
Exactly which elephant are you talking about?
The GOP? Well, this year they ARE behind.
No politics.
I don't do cliches
"Do you think he'll ever forget us?
What's a meta for?
Alexa, how do I eliminate pet odor?
I see a lot of gray area in this election.
He's moving out as soon as he pays off his student debt.
Ok, someone has to bring this up.....How on earth do we get the elephant out of the room....
Don't you think it's time we talked about it?
Hey honey, get a load of this stupid cartoon in the New Yorker.
well, you’re never using one click shopping again…
Tell me again -- Trump can't win, right?
Did you order the litter like I asked you to?
Look, I'm sorry, but we've GOT to talk about him.
I've exhausted my genteelisms
No, I said I live WITH Dumbo.
They said she'd bring our blood pressure down.
David, I was speaking *metaphorically.*
I know it's tough to be a proud Republican these days, but we should let him go outside.
Wonder if elephants have hindsight?
He may resent us now for kicking him out, but he’ll thank us later after he learns to get by on his own.
You can't blame that on the dog.
Really?
It's time to address the G.O.P nominee in the room.
What a relief! When you called me at work and said you wanted to discuss the elephant in the room, I figured I was in big trouble.
What elephant in the room?
Do you think he knows we voted early?
What is an eight letter word for Savannah pooper?
I still don't want to discuss it.
We're going to need bigger pooper scooper.
WHY won't you talk about it?
It's glaringly obvious you're ignoring me.
He's demanding a recount.
There's something I've been meaning to talk to you about.
What I want to know is how do you get the elephant out of the room.
I'M SORRY! Comey's October Surprise was the only chance at the big house. Damn that early voting.
Which room?
It's a metaphor for our mutual disinterest.
Who do you think drew him here?
We need to talk.
Ok, I'll go get the leash while you drive the pooper-scooper around front.
I don't want to say anything but I think he's in the wrong room.
Darling, would you bring our guest a chair?
Can't we please STOP talking about the elephant in the room?
What I asked for dear, was an ivory accented trunk.
Face reality, honey—she’s pregnant.
Hurry up and figure it out. In 15 minutes, I have to be in another room.
I'd be really worried if there were also a mouse in the room.
Well, are we going to talk about it?
I think he wants us out of the room.
This place is a zoo!
If it's not one circus,it's another.
There must be an easier way to flatten the rug.
Save the Circus Animals my foot! Couldn't we have rescued a kitten instead?
I think a two bedroom with a jungle view would be perfect
Do you smell peanuts?
They were fresh out of chihuahuas.
Do you smell something?
So then what is stopping us, if we both want to talk about it!?
It's the Republican parties 'Last Hurrah!'
What was wrong with the giraffe?
It wasn't funny the FIRST time you "rang for the butler!"
OLYPHANT! I said I like Tim OLYPHANT.
Well yes.....but why not just a lawn sign.
I don't care about your affair with Debra. There is something else we need to talk about right now.
There must be something besides Trump we could talk about.
Your therapy pachyderm squashed my support Schnauzer.
I'm sure it's your turn!
I'm not the one who said anything would be better than the 800-pound gorilla.
I'm talking about a REAL elephant in the room.
"See honey? Isn't it better just to suppress our feelings when we disagree on topics we're deeply, emotionally invested in?
We should have gone with the RINO.
Of curse I'm a loyal Republican, but I don't see why it has to hide out at our house.
Okay, if you insist, we can talk about it.
I'm not falling for that elephant in the room trick again.
Yes, of course I'm speaking metaphorically.
But it's really difficult not to talk about it.
If we don't talk about him, maybe he'll just go away.
I'll bet he gets trampled.
But he was such a cute puppy!
Bit of a cliché, don`t you think?
Sorry, honey, I forgot. What were we talking about?
It's like you don't even want to talk about it.
No!... It's YOUR turn to change the litter box!
I've addressed the elephant in the room. It's ours.
I told you, there's no such thing as a teacup elephant.
Harold, can you really dispute that our life has become a cliche?
I'm not acknowledging it, per se. I'm just saying that I'm tired of picking up 400 pounds of manure everyday.
Is it blocking your light?
Have you built a boat in the basement too?
There's something we need to talk about.
I actually wanted to talk about the metaphorical one.
and we don't have to make any donations to the zoo fund for 30 years
This is really bugging me. Is it "The Emperor has no clothes . . . ?"
I think Slow-Pokey wants to go out, dear.
What's a three letter word for donkey?
I know you said, 'marry me, marry my elephant' but does he have to spend every day in the house with us?!
Dear, put the paper down and there is something we have to talk about.
What do you mean you don't see it... It's an elephant!
It is time we talked about the elephant in the room
"Honey, what are your plans with the Trump piñata? You have two more weeks, max
It's not funny anymore.
Next time I want vaulted ceilings.
Can we talk about the elephant in the room?
How much longer are we going to go before we address that godawful rug?
Why did you think that naming it would help?
Is it me, or is there something we should be talking about?
I don't know where the Republican Party goes after Trump, but it isn't here.
Is this our therapist's idea of a joke?
But Marty, it was the last one left at the Barney's trunk sale!
Really? You're telling me you can't see it?
I don't want to talk about it.
It is Donald Trump's favorite pet peeve.
I think it's time for us to clear the air now.
Darn, what's that phrase again for the obvious problem that everyone is ignoring?
I haven't followed politics in a while. What's new?
I told you we should have left that elephant under the table.
I know what it is, and I don't need to keep hearing you say it.
Plus there's still that unicorn in the garden.
Dear, I think it's time you took him for his nightly rampage.
No! I am certainly not going to pull his finger.
What do you mean you don't want to talk about it?
I thought you said you'd closed the door.
If you haven't been eating all those peanuts, then please tell me who the hell is?
Can we stop talking about him?
5 letters across, starts with T: Makes loud noises and habitually hurls mud.
No, you get the shovel.
I wonder if he knows, that we know he's in here...
OK, fine. If I agree to talk about the elephant in the room, will he finally go away?
You know that any caption contest entry about 'the elephant in the room' doesn't stand a chance, right?
Really, Do you have to be so literal?
What elephant? It's just a mirage of Trump pretending not to be a donkey.
Where's the donkey?
Honey, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about.
Oh, don't mention it.
Let me guess, there is an elephant in the room.
Do you expect me to cook for both of you?
Well you have to admit that the room seems a lot bigger since we got rid of the 800-pound gorilla
We'd be better off just getting him stuffed.
Is this the new elephant in the room, or the old one?
I try not to think about it.
If you think Trump's a problem, consider this: the maid just quit.
I swear I hear the kitchen faucet dripping again.
He looked cold, so I let him in.
No more excuses, we need a high volume toilet!
Is there? I hadn't noticed.
I don't know about you, but I plan on ignoring it.
It's just until the election's over, and then we'll let him free.
That's not the grey I had in mind.
Let's talk about something else.
Address it!
Well, Mr. Figure of Speech, we have to, because I just Googled it: every 6 hours and 20 pounds a pop."
It's your turn to ignore!
you pick it up next time.....
Speaking of Republican asses...
I don't want to sound cliche but...
Is there anything in that paper about a missing elephant?
Mr. Trump never is subtle
I think we should discuss it before he does something we will both regret.
Race in America? I thought it was our sex life.
I think you're missing something really big!
You are losing it. There is no elephant in this room.
I don't mind that your parents are Republicans, but agreeing to watch their pet while they're away is ridiculous.
Can we just forget about it?
I think you are taking the Party support too far.
Was there something we needed to talk about?
Maybe it was okay having him around early in the primaries, but that was then and this is now.
I mean that literally. And we have to deal with it.
I was not being trite. I really did mean "literally"
I am not even going to say it Honey, it just to easy!
Looks like the GOP Establishment got kicked out of the Tea Party next door.
We're going to need a bigger litter box.
YOU get under there, Mr. Twister champ.
i thought you said he was a horse's ass
I don't care if it is a rescue animal.
He's just pissed because I wouldn't make him an 800-pound gorilla costume.
I know.
Mary, we need to talk about your volunteer work at the rescue shelter.
This is your week to clean the house.
Voting Democrat; need the space!
-------- in the room" meaning an unspoken presence. "Honey, what is an 8 letter word for...
Honey, it's just our imagination. Everything is just fine.
Can we talk about the elephant in the room?
We need to talk.
She's waiting patiently for you to walk her.
I think he wants to go out.
So you showed them that the bylaws permit elephants as 'comfort animals'. Now what?
What elephant, Honey?
Must you always be so graphic?
Okay 41 across..Large pachyderm....No don't tell me it's on the tip of my tongue...ummm.
I think it's time we discussed the humans in the room.
Fine. But you're cleaning up after him.
Was that you?
Let's talk about what??
So where's the fly on the wall?
Honey, not yet - he's still in the room...
He's also scared of mice, but at least he won't forget our anniversary.
I won't mention it if you don't.
We need to discuss the elephant in the room...these tiny, uncomfortable chairs.
We can talk about it on Nov 9th.
"Pin the tail on the donkey" just took another meaning.
Did you happen to ... never mind.
We REALLY can't ignore this one.
No, I don't think this is the best thing to emulate my mother visiting us.
Fine. I'm an elephant. I'm in the room. So sue me.
I agree that we want to ignore it but I wish it weren't so literal.
I smell peanut butter
Let's get Reince Priebus to clean it up.
You're going to ignore it for being literal?
You should see the one in the foyer.
Couldn’t we just get a simple yard sign to show our political party support?
I hate living in a "red" state!
Absolutely no more table scraps.
"Did you fart?
He'd better not!
If I have to look at this animal for another week, I'm moving to Canada.
All I wanted was a "Make America Great Again" button.
Really Richard...and that's what you think this is about?
When I said that, I was speaking METAPHORICALLY!
It depends what you mean by 'Elephant'.
It's only here when you ask how I am voting.
Oh yeah? Well, I bet your dog can't alienate minorities AND control Congress at the same time.
I see we're out of peanuts again.
Why do you insist on filling the house with Republican propaganda?
You wanted an elephant? Fine, we got an elephant. Now YOU have to empty the litter box!
To create some more space, how about storing a few things in the trunk?
If you say "literally" again, I'm going to kick your "donkey."
...nothing much. How was your day?
Do I need to use that trite expression!
It is butt ugly!
Dear, I have the oddest feeling there's something you wanted to tell me.
You're wrong, Honey, I was the one who last took him out.
Yes, I know, dear. The joke writes itself. It's not funny.
All right. Now, let's discuss my plans for the kitchen.
You and I need to have a serious conversation about the weather.
If it gets any bigger, it'll be the room in the elephant.
How can they ignore me?
it's just a metaphor...
What if she's not potty trained?
Let’s talk about the elephant in the room, my mother is here to stay
I feel so lucky that we can talk about anything.
Okay, Gerry - I bought the pinata, now you get to fill it.
Look, it's either him or it's Hillary.
I told you we should have stuck witrh the Trump yard sign.
'Elephant in the room'? His name is Simon, and don't talk about him like he can't hear us.
We need a donkey to keep him company.
I don't want to talk about it!
I don't want to talk about it.
Maybe we're going about this the wrong way. How about we turn off the light, sit very quietly and simply stop acknowledging it altogether?
Can't we ever talk about something else?
He's getting teased at school about Donald Trump.
Honey... You're not thinking of voting Republican, are you?
Although some might argue that there is such a thing as taking party pride too far.
Must we always bring the elephant into THIS room?
Stop asking her, "What rhymes with Trump?". You're making her self-conscious.
It hasn't been that much trouble, I usually never even meet the Airbnb guests.
I think you've carried your Republican ardor a little too far.
What, and quit show business?
Maybe if we turned it around it wouldn't look so scary.
Go ahead. You can say it.
He got here after trampling all of the independent candidates
Party Loyalty is one thing ----- but not in our living room!
The GOP sent out their biggest weapon.
'He just wants you to acknowledge him, that's all.'
Point taken, Mister Metaphor.
It's the only Donald phrase I agree with at the moment, "Get'em out of here.
I am just saying, I don't think probosciuity should hinder anyone from becoming president.
Harold, I think its time we deal with the lamp in the room.
She won't mind me saying that she's a bit on the large side, she's got very thick skin.
This should keep the Clintons out of the House.
Well, I guess they showed that Democratic jackass a thing or two.
Sure I'd like to move to a bigger unit. But no other rental has as liberal a pet clause.
Are you sure the exterminator got all the mice?
I have the sense there's something we need to discuss.
He's mad because I don't want to talk about the people in the room.
I said I thought it would be nice is we had a plant in the living room.
Oh, I'm sorry! Does his ass cast a shadow over your glorious paper?
What are we missing here?
Are you happy now? The elephant IS the room.
I don't think he did, dear, but did YOU forget something?
Wow, the literal elephant is much larger than my figurative one!
To be honest, I'm not even sure how it got inside.
Don't worry. It's just symbolic. It'll be gone November 8th.
So...what are you thinking for dinner?
It's a big mammal and has 8 letters.
...and what are we gonna do about the tRUMP in the room?
yes I already explained to him no Trumpeting in the house
Really, George, I thought we got rid of this one in marriage counseling.
Can we talk?
Are you wearing a new cologne?
Dear, There is something we need to discuss.
Remember when I used to be your imaginary friend? Now you never look at me.
I can hear you.
Can we just admit this cartion isn't going to be funny.
It's your turn to get the super duper pooper scooper.
Do I have to spell it out for you?
His art teacher assigned a project on Hyperrealism." "What happened to bead bracelets and clay pots?
I think we need to discuss the room around the elephant?
Ask Reince when we can stop pretending he isn't there.
Do you think he would leave if we finally talked about it?
Show a little kindness -- how can you ignore him when his party's been ruined?
What do you mean John when you say you pulled a thorn out of his foot.
It is hard to ignore, you know . . .
OK. I get it. Now how do you get him out of here.
Well, no one can say we didn't talk about it.
Regardless he is leaving November 9th!
Once the camel got his nose into the tent, the cat was let out of the bag, and now we have an 800-pound gorilla.
Well what do YOU want to talk about?
Then I heard her say, 'What are we going to do about the humans in the room?'
What! Two bumper stickers and a lawn sigh aren't enough?
As soon as you know who leaves, there's something I have to talk about with you.
Did you have to mention Trump?
It's your turn
Gah! Aren't you done with the newspaper yet?
They say, barring some miracle, he only has until November 8th to live.
It's just another reminder to vote for Democrats.
There's an elephant in the room.
So, any other bargains at the Barnum & Bailey white elephant sale?
"Let's not sweep it under the rug".
I told you a studio wouldn't work.
Don't even.
He acts as if he owns the place!
Are you ready to talk about it NOW?
Trunk Tower, eh?
...and, he's got a big butt!
No, it's your turn to walk Ellie.
It's obvious that he's figured a way to manipulate the numbers on his Fitbit.
Are you sure you put your ballot in the right box?
I get the message, George, you're voting Republican.
HE didn’t forget my birthday, Dumbo.
Well I'm not going to be the one to bring it up.
I know we agreed not to talk about him, but it's your night to clean up.
Nobody wants to talk about him but can we do something about him?
Honey, all fighting aside, I think it is literally time we talk about the elephant in the room for once.
It's your turn to take him out.
"No Gladys-shhhh! I don't think we should talk about it. That's EXACTLY what he wants us to do!
Can we at least agree to ignore it?
I know you want to talk about it, but wouldn't the gorilla have been better?
I'm tired of talking about the Elephant. Let's talk about the room.
You realize that if he wins the election we'll have to move.
Please reassure me that he is housebroken.
Let's just acknowledge we're not a wild and zany couple and quit trying.
I changed the litter last.
You're forgetting the first rule of Elephant in the Room Club
What 10,000 pound gorilla?
If he farts one more time, I'm leaving you.
Can we at least have a trunk sale.
No, YOU take him for his walk!
I still say it looks like his comb-over to me.
Fine, thanks, and how was work?
Are you sure this skirt doesn't make me look fat?
This negative campaining is oppressive.
Lets keep ignoring it until it defecates or gives birth.
Maybe you should have looked up the meaning of pachyderm before you bought the ticket.
I'm the only one for Trump in the precinct, so the party said I could keep him until election day.
George!The elephant in the room IS an elephant!
Your mother called to ask if we voted. I'll take the Arts and Leisure page when you're finished with it.
Does it feel like there's an elephant in the room or is it just me?
Look in the "Troubleshooting" section
I told you ignorance is not bliss!
He can't find his birth certificate
Just a cliche?
You read sports page to relax...give me an elephant any day.
The giraffe was already in the refrigerator
Now can we talk about it?
Lock her up!
To be honest, I preferred the Gorilla.
All you do is sit and read. I want us to go out. Just the three of us.
Well, can we at least name it?
Which came first, the elephant or the room?
There's a saying but I forget what it is.
The elephant in the room is the elephant in the room!
I wish that you never signed up for the RNC.
At least he got rid of the 700 pound gorilla.
He wants to talk about the lighting in the room.
I've been struggling whether to tell you, but there's a fly on the lampshade.
Do you like it? It's a metaphor for your 22 year old lover.
HENRY, ARE YOU HAVING AN AFFAIR?
I'm for supporting the republicans as much as you but I think we might have finally crossed some kind of line here
I'm telling you we need a huge tent to deal with this.
We need to talk about the marriage in the room.
It's time to walk him.
You know, we are definitely not going to just sweep this under the rug.
I'd rather have an 800-pound gorilla.
NOW can we discuss the 800 pound gorilla?
I know you are Trump supporter but do you have to be obvious about it?
Anything else?
Now you do you remember
We need to either talk about it or find a shovel and a bucket.
I'm not normally one for clichés but I think we really should talk about this
You said you'd do ANYTHING to save this marriage, Harry.
Ok, so talking about it was Plan A. Plan B is going to involve peanuts and a tranquilizer gun.
Junior may be getting too big for time-out.
Yes, Dear, I notice it too - the thermostat's broken again!
Your point being?
I still think that Aladdin is a perfect name for your pet. Clearly that is some magic carpet.
Must you always be so literal?"
I think I've got the better end of the argument.
He's pouting to get attention. Just ignore him.
Now can we address the 300 square-foot apartment?
Nooo... I'm pretty sure you said living in DUMBO.
At a minimum, we'll need a wheelbarrow and shovel and a new rug.
I don't understand why we can't host game night.
I don't know if we should have traded the 800 pound gorilla for it.
So, is the ‘truth we want to ignore’ staying for dinner?
I bought him to take our mind off of the election.
I thought it was a metaphor.
At least when I over imbibe, they're pink.
I think there is, uh, what do you call "an obvious issue we are unwilling to discuss?"
There's something we need to talk about.
Let's talk about your discomfort with me talking about what you avoid.
I don't care if it's the only ethical way to own ivory!!!
I think it's time we discuss.....you know....
It's not always just an expression.
He's afraid to go outside until Trump leaves the party.
No, you're the dumbo!
It's your turn to walk him.
The ad says, "DUMBO adjacent."
We have started the process of releasing him back into the wild. Today we find out if he is ready to attack unfamiliar humans rather than ask them for food.
I say we talk about it.
I think he's been talking about us.
Did you remember to pick up the T-R-A-N-Q-U-I-L-I-Z-E-R?
It's the end of the Republican party as we know it.
Joan, just get it off your chest, I'm starting to feel claustrophobic.
It's hard to ignore this end of the elephant in the room.
He's a rescue animal. I got him away from a donkey who was beating him.
Any unusual stories in the papers?
They're big in Europe.
No, it's not considered a metaphor when the figure of speech is literally applicable. It's just annoying!
You might as well admit it, you're a republican!
Thank God he's housebroken.
Could you, PLEASE read somewhere else? You're entering my personal space!
But just to play it safe tell him again his stay is over after November 8th. Then my mother can return.
Well, you have to admit, it's a great conversation piece.
Wait a sec...where did you get that newspaper??
Where's the Tic Tac's?
Don't worry honey. It won't become president.
Don't say it.
Have you seen the cat?
The safari guide did say animal viewing was guaranteed.
Phew! What made you think you could sneak that one by me?
Do I even need to say it?
Your mother's lease is up in December?
Must you always be so literal?
Don't let it bother you -- after all, he's ignoring the humans in the room.
Don't you think you're taking this republican thing a little bit to far.
"What's that expression again that describes an obvious truth that is being addressed?
I thought we agreed, no politics after dinner.
He hasn't wagged his tail since the election.
She'll never admit it, but I think she forgot why she came in here.
John, it's your turn to walk him.
"It's your turn to walk him".
This is the last time we're pet-sitting for Noah.
A sleeping dog would have been more affordable.
Can we talk about the people in the room?
Hey, remember when I said "There's an elephant in the room," like figuratively, and you said, "We should totally get a real elephant and put it in the room!"? Yeah. We shouldn't drink so much.
Hand me that paper, this could get messy...
It's only temporary, dear. Once the election's over, he's got to face the public again.
Do you smell peanuts?
Like how much it annoys me when you say "literally," when you mean "figuratively?"
So, we're just not going to talk about it?
He used to be at the main office of Wells Fargo.
We never should have invited him to the party.
When I said the GOP could hide out here until after the election this is not what I had in mind.
I know, I know, but can we PRETEND to ignore it tonight?
Of course this is about the elephant in the room!!
Harold, we need to talk...and if there was a ever a time to use the word "literally" correctly, it's most certainly now.
It's your job to clean up after our metaphorical idioms.
You know it's just a phrase, right?
No. I'm sick of talking about it.
I heard a 'Who' too
If you say, "Tusk, Tusk" one more time, I'm going to shove you up this elephant's ass.
Can we please talk about something else?
We just have to learn to get past the elephant in the room.
You made your point. The "rescue" stripper was not the worst possible choice.
Literally Literally Literally
He came with a shovel and a wheelbarrow.
I don't know, maybe we downsized too much.
I always assumed it represented the sorry state of our 401(k), but now you're telling me we've been living with an actual elephant in the room all this time.
I feel like there's something you're not saying.
I knew we should've voted democratic this year.
Did they even see the elephant when they built this house?
The elephant in the room is 'an elephant in the room'!
....
If you just put the paper down, I'm sure you would see it
She finds bedbugs.
Yes you are too literal!
I said I don't want to talk about it.
Let's get right down to it without acknowleging the obvious, shall we.
[no caption at all]
Is there a draft in here?
I get your point now deflate it.
His name is Paul & he wants to hide here for 4 years
Yes Howard, you are the last true Republican.
But I can't go on ignoring it till November 8th!
Nobody wants to talk about the lamp in the room
Should we discuss it?
I believed you Harold, when you said it was over, but why then is she here?
It's not a good election year to keep him outside.
..and there's another GOP surrogate hiding in the kitchen !
Could you be more subtle?
I told you to vote for Hillary!
Is their something obvious you need to tell me?
Just say it!
Ugh honey, was that you or the elephant in the room?
If You See Something, Say Something.
We should finish making that inlaid ivory table this weekend.
"Please stop talking in cliches".
I suggest denial as the best way to cope with this
How did he get in?
See--each party has their bad side.
He seems uncomfortable about the people in the room.
Honey, I think your breath smells like peanuts.
It's easier to talk about him when he looks the other way.
I'm ok with the elephant, as long as the orangutan is kept in its cage.
Sometimes you think we should talk about what?
Is there something we should be talking about?
I can't compete with your need for a bigger audience.
I think we should say something about it.
Instead of counseling, we could just expand the room.
Sure, but there's no ignoring the huge orange turd.
Did you leave the door open again?
No, let's talk about the one in THIS room.
You think that's going to persuade me to vote Republican?
What made you think we could save the Republican party?
We found that most people who buy these things use them for workshops
After this, I don't think you have anywhere else to go with your taxidermy.
Who's going to clean up his shit after the election?
... Well I think it's time to talk about your MOTHER.
I don't want to talk about it
He's tired of being a cliché.
Can we donate it to the white elephant sale?
He's not leaving until we talk about it.
We need to talk about the Republican in the room.
The poor thing's ruing the day Trump got a hold of her.
What's the discuss? It's an elephant.
The armchairs have to go.
For Pete's sake, will you just stop beating around the bush?
He said he's feeling ignored
Please put the paper down and let's talk about the elephant in the room..
He's refusing to acknowledge us.
I don't want to talk about it.
He asked if he can stay until after the election.
"Just when I thought Trump was the biggest Elephant in the room".
Dear, what's that smell?
I foresee us cleaning up after this metaphor all night long.
Can we at least talk about the mess I have to clean up every day?
Did you step in dog shit?
The subject you've been trying to avoid IS THE DAMN ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM!
You can address it all you want, as long as you start cleaning up after it.
It's like there is an elephant in the room.
I thought it'd be more of a greeny grey.
He gets depressed when you talk about that 800-pound gorilla.
Sex.
Umm, no, we can't just agree to disagree!
Well, at least we know what the elephant in the room is.
I am not talking about it
Let's face it, Harry. The Republican Party is occupying too much of our lives.
I liked the 800-pound gorilla better.
Perhaps its time we talk about the 800 lb gorilla in the room.
Yes, dear. I'll put the skeletons back in the closet and return the elephant tomorrow.
I'm feeling behind.
Of course he's a cliche, but I still want to talk about him.
Will you promise me not to mention it?
I don't care if you want to talk about him or not. He needs to be out of here after November 8th!
If we must have trouble communicating, Arthur, I prefer the gorilla.
Did you not know that lawn campaign signs were limited to a certain size?
Why doesn't anyone want to talk about him?
If he's staying, can we at least dress him?
He looked a lot smaller in the store.
No, I'm not accusing you of avoiding anything. There really is an elephant in the room!
I guess we should talk about the affair I've been having.
how should I know? It's been here since we moved in.
I don't care if he is hypoallergenic.
Quick - lay down that newspaper!
He's telling you, he really needs to go for his walk NOW!
Are you sure it's house broken?
Can you hear me now?
What are we gonna do about all this junk, all this junk inside this trunk?
I would have preferred the gorilla.
Actually there is an elephant in the room
What are you people doing in my room?
Do you think you can move her out of the room without looking like you are groping her?
Forget the elephant in the room! We need to talk about Trump
It has something to do with November 8th, but he won't say what.
Things are better now that she is paper trained.
Did you notice I got those stains out of the rug?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I would like to forget this years election but...
I was so distracted by the elephant in the room that I forgot about your affair
Let's face it, we are subject to a huge cliché.
I tell you I smell a trump.
Will you PLEASE stop reading the Trump articles to me!
It's your turn with the litter box.
I said we need a Jumbo loan, not a Dumbo loan.
Actually, I'm talking about the whiskey in your coffee.
Don't act like you don't see the elephant in the room. It's your turn to walk him.
Let's acknowledge the couple in the room
Honey, our elephant is gay.
...and you're SURE he's housebroken?
You wanted to bring him home. You have to clean up after him.
The memory may be flawless, but the system is not.
She knows what she did.
Just because you don't see it doesn't mean you don't have to clean up after it.
"Let's face it, pet sitting just isn't our thing".
If we just ignore it, it will eventually go away!
Don't tell me you fed him beans again.
"You say it". "No No. YOU say it".
Something stinks.
No, it's your turn to walk him, & don't forget again to take a large plastic bag.
No, he can't hide here until after the election.
I've been cheating on you.
Honey, PLEASE don't grab the low hanging fruit.
You just h_a_d_ to know how the trick worked.
I know it's my turn, but would you mind taking her out for a her walk?
It's politically correct not to mention it.
Just as with those right-wing Populists, you need a really big shovel.
Well I guess this time we have to talk about the elephant in the room
This house isn't big enough for the three of us. Raj and I understand each other. I think, Dear, you should leave.
We have to talk about it . . . in about 18 months, she's delivering twins!
Do you smell peanuts?
Whatta ya mean, "What Elephant"?!
Stephen, you know it hurts his feelings when you refuse to address him.
"OK Stanley--If You vote for Trump then you get to shovel"!
He's voting for a third-party candidate this year.
He's tired of us calling him THE. He wants us to use his name.
No, this isn't about who empties the litter box.
We have to talk about the elephant in the room.
He looks lonely...I think we need to adopt another one.
I explode if I see one more "Elephant in the room" cartoon caption.
These days I really wish we were Democrats.
It was either this or those dumb red hats.
How many carpets does that make now?
I knew we should have begun talking when he was young.
John, I don't think this centerpiece is working.
I walked him this morning!
A penny for your thoughts
I think it's time that we talked about your party affiliation.
Think you'll get started on that umbrella stand today?
Honey, can you at least acknowledge him?
What did you want to talk about?
What, you didn't think I noticed the 500-pound gorilla?
Great--I just got done cleaning up after the 800-pound gorilla.
Uh, look, I really think we have to . . . Coffee?
Well, I think you paid too much for your mutant, hairless Chihuahua.
I can't believe he's still ignoring us.
I walked him this morning. It's your turn.
Of course he's depressed, how would you like it?
I don't want to talk about it.
Tell Jack and Marjorie the downstairs apartment will be available soon.
Is there anything you'd like to discuss?
There's an obvious truth that's going unaddressed.
It's bigly!
I have a couple of questions.
We need to talk about the room around the elephant.
The neighbors are STILL complaining? We put a rug down!
Vote for her and I promise he’ll go away.
Hon, we really, really, really have to talk about it.
This still doesn't change my vote
As you can clearly see my political affiliations are to the right
I want a divorce.
Enough about Hillary and her damn emails! This Elephant is about to shit on our head.
I'd rather not discuss it.
Yeah, he was cute when he was a baby.
We need to talk.
Isn't he supposed to be in the corner?
It's your turn to walk him
Can we please just talk about the elephant in the room?
He has huge rejection issues.
Don't you think I've tried "sit boy, sit"?
Perhaps we should switch over to Democrats before it's too late.
I hear what you're saying. But what if we just redecorate?
Of course, the elephant in the room is the elephant in the room.
Does it come with its own litter box?
Now can we discuss Anthony Weiner?
He's looking for the bathroom.
You want to discuss what?
He is not centered on the carpet.
I'd rather face an elephant's ass than an ass's elephant.
I think we are going to need a bigger litter box.
Remember? This is the one I told you about.
Don't address him, it's just what he wants you to do.
What.....did you say something, dear?
I can't wait for this election to be over!
Where do we put the litter box?
Your metaphores are getting harder to ignore.
Is this what they mean when they say, 'Trump's behind in the race?'
Costco has a sale on giant size Air-wisk.
All right, Gerald, I give up. Why the elephant?
Teddy saw a mouse today. Know a good carpenter?
Pardon?
I thought you said they were putting a sign in the yard. We don't even have any peanuts.
No, seriously, we need to discuss the elephant in the room.
No, it's your turn to walk her!
George always had a way of going overboard to make a point.
We've never talked about it before, darling, I don't know why we should start now. Would you like a glass of wine?
No. I thought you invited him.
Let's discuss the elephant in the room........
I thought we were past the " your pants looked a little tight" comment....
You can ignore him, but not his litter box.
This may hurt.
Remember when we used to talk about it?
Can't we talk about the news for a change?
I said I don't want to talk about it!
I can't be with a man who supports that mastadon.
Do you smell something?
Somebody needs to fess up... who's footprint is in the butter?
Ever felt the need for a Tic Tac?
Why does it matter whether she left the Republican Party or it left her?
Hmm. Humans in the room...
Do you smell something?
So, the weather today was nice.
I literally want you to acknowledge it.
I think it's about time we talked about it...
Ixnay on the ephantel-ay in the omro-ay.
We don't have to talk about it, but you know one of us is going to have to clean up after it.
This is ridiculous! We have to talk about the elephant in the room.
Nope. Nothing to say here. How about you?
You bought it, you clean up after it.
No, I did not "let one"!
Can we just watch a wild life program on t.v. tonight.
If I were you, I'd finish reading that newspaper soon.
Can we discuss it now?
I warned you he'd only get bigger if we ignored him.
Repeat after me, 'I won't talk about it. I won't talk about it. I won't talk about it.'
I think we need to talk about your taste in lamps.
Well you may not be ignoring the elephant in the room, but you sure never notice when it's time to clean up after it!
You just HAD to vote republican !
He dislikes your misuse of the term '800-pound gorilla.'
Just don't mention how fat he's become.
What Donkey?
When I donated to "Save the Elephants" I didn't know it would lead to this!
Well, it's his party and he'll cry if he wants to.
They never want to talk about the people in the room.
Did you hear something?
How can so much hide be hidden?
Don't pretend I didn't warn you! Now open all the windows!
Obviously, he hasn't forgotten you invited him.
We need to talk about cleanup.
People never want discuss anything except the elephant!
Do you think it's too late to exchange him and go back to the gorilla?
So... who are you going to vote for?
I don't care if he can understand us!
We never talk about the election.
... And you're telling me it'll just 'disappear' if we address it?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Roger, you are NOT going to let him hide in here until the next election cycle.
John, I need to talk to you.
I've put this off too long, Frank. I'm running off with Jumbo.
Okay, let's talk about it.
He hasn't been outside all day, and oh by the way, the service elevator is out of order.
Are you even listening to me?
Where did the gorilla go?
Do you think he knows we're talking about him?
I thought 'the elephant in the room' was just a figure of speech.
Sure, everything's definitely normal.
Doesn't it even bother you that your end of the party produced and still supports Trump?
Eventually we are going to have to address the you know what.
Yes, I bought it for you for your birthday...don't mention it.
Have you waked him today?
Why must you always bring up politics.
But what will we do with him after the election?
I'll flip you for the next enema!
well dear at least it was not a 2 for 1 sale
We need to talk.
I said "I don't want to talk about it'.
He doesn't want to talk about us, either.
I have this sudden, insatiable appetite for peanuts.
Just don't ask him to sit down.
Even if they take away our rifles, all we need to survive is bigger freezer.
Elections come and go. This one will, too!
Now us Republicans are going to have to clean up what's about to happen.
Harold, I don’t care whether Ringling Bros was giving away Donald or not. He doesn’t fit in our apartment.
He's hiding from their candidate.
George, I told you to vote Democratic!
'I didn't say anything.'
I couldn't get the 800 pound gorilla. So I traded up.
Barbara, I honestly don't know what you're talking about.
What? An 800 pound gorilla wasn't enough?
I know Ringling doesn't use them anymore but this is ridiculous.
Something beginning with 'E'? Nup, I give up.
I hope you bought enough Lysol for your precious point.
Please don't tell me you're still voting for Dumbo
Did you forget something?
Gary, I think it's time we address...well, you know.
When you read to him in that condescending tone of voice, you really hurt his feelings!
Don't kid yourself. Every body always sees the elephant in the room.
Okay, so denial is a powerful, primitive psychological defense. Says who?
I guess we need to talk.
It's your turn to take the Trump out.
Ignoring isn't working dear.
I guess metaphor is dead, too?
Look Jack, I'm sorry but you're going to have to move out. I just need some space.
By then, it was too late: we'd already signed the lease.
Sometimes metaphors can be a real drag.
The republic inn
This animal is the perfect metaphor for our current republican candidate.
Let's not talk about him on airbnb.
And where would you two suggest we'd even put a dog in this apartment?
It's not politics, or religion, it's the other thingy.
Do you smell peanut breath?
She signed off from Twitter because of all the fat shaming.
I never said your mother overstayed her welcome
Have you heard about the elephant who's escaped from the zoo?
These days he's looking for a corner to hide in.
Dave, what's going on? We don't talk anymore!
Thank reminds me, I took your gray suit to the cleaners.
Honey, do you smell something funny?
We need to talk.
Dear, there is something I believe we need to acknowledge.
I think it's time we both had a snow shovel!
So now we're ignoring two party icons?
You didn't actually think I'd forget your birthday, did you?
She says the rug makes her feet feel good.
He's always butting into our peaceful family time together.
Well, I voted for Hillary and you voted for Hillary, so who could've bookmarked all those Trump sites on the laptop?
So... Would you care to address the elephant in the room?
Its what's going to be in the room after he eats that we have to talk about.
So you don't want to talk about getting a bigger place?
I know he followed us home but think about what happens after he eats.
Do you think we should notify Congress?
I'm ignoring it, literally.
Remember, I might forgive and forget but Precious will never.
This puts you on my endangered species list.
Elephant ?....what elephant.
Listen ... we really need to talk
Elephants are the least of my worries.
I keep telling him, some things you DO have to forget.
He said he was in the GOP Circus, got lost, and was looking for a home.
I guess now we know where are those peanut shells are coming from.
Go. You know what happened the last time you delayed his evening walk.
Do you think the rug is flat yet?
Is there something we need to talk about?
Shall we keep ignoring it?
What did you expect when you bought the 25 pound bag of peanuts at Cosco?
It's a movement I don't want to be part of.
Honey, this silence is crushing.
We're gonna need a real big litter box.
I think we need to talk about my missing laxatives.
I'd like to address the you know what, in the you know where; elephant or ass, we're in real trouble here.
ignore it
We're officially republican.
Sure, Hillary's a horse's ass, but Trump ...
If you're not going to say it, I will. The elephant in the room needs a bath.
Don't look now but . . .
No, it's not just a metaphor! Check out that huge stinky pile by the door.
Is this really the best angle?
When you build a wall, it also keeps him in
His teacher called today. He failed another civics test .
I guess the donkey is whooping it up at the White House.
Africa or India?
This was never about the GOP. His name is Antonio...and we're in love.
Not tonight, buster! Tonight you're going to put down the paper, and we're going to discuss the elephant in this room!
Put the paper down and let's talk about the elephant in the room.
I said you need a barber not Babar
We need to talk.
You're reading the newspaper does not help make Dumbo Donald fade away.
Just look! I'm not speaking metaphorically this time!
He's not leaving until we talk about it!
I suspect that the flat below us may be getting flatter.
I don't mind ignoring the unmentionable in the room, but the unsmellable is a different kettle of fish.
Maybe we could just hint to the GOP that it's time to get out?
I am adjusting to the new normal.
Let's get one thing out of the way first.
The neighbours say they want to address something. I can't think of what it could be.
I wish he was a little more liberal with his space.
Did you remember to get more tissue?
Well I've tried everything else to get your attention!
Put down the newspaper darling so we can discuss the elephant in the room.
Enough, Charles. We can't pretend to ignore your obsession with interpreting metaphors literally any longer.
He never forgets to wipe his feet.
Let's wait until it leaves the room, this time.
That's nice dear...
THIS is why you wanted high ceilings?
Jumbo realizes that no one's talking about the humans in the room.
Is the elephant in the room house-trained?
Put your paper down, Ralph. We really have to talk.
She'll never forget you said that!
I want the sofa back, Steve, so let's just talk about it already.
If there were ever a time to address the obvious problem in our relationship, now would be it.
What happened to all of those beans I bought?
Are you trying to tell me something?
The elephant wants to talk about about the donkey in the room.
He’s not sleeping in our bed!
OK. Fine. Don't talk about it, but the GOP is not going away.
But, darling, we've always shared who we're going to vote for in the past. Why won't you talk about it this year?
I wonder when they're going to take me for a walk?
No, your literal-mindedness is STILL the elephant in the room.
And when, exactly, is it time we address the wife in the room?
No question about your party loyalty!
Can you put down that newspaper for once and discuss the elephant in the room?!

The Republican's must really need our vote.
What's the problem? I wanted ivory candlesticks; you lectured me about preserving habitat.
So beans fuel his magic carpet ride?
Look on the bright side, at least it's not an alligator.
Sure, I'll talk about it.
You promised you would teach him how to ride a bike.
I told you there was no such thing as a miniature elephant.
I promise I'll walk him every day.
Don't say it, dear. It's just too easy - even for you.
Let's hope his is constipated tonight
Quit blaming it on the elephant.
Can we talk about it?
And you thought the donkey was an ass?
It's the elephant in the room that we're not going to talk about.
And I always wondered where that expression came from.
There's an elephant in the room!
I didn't think you were serious.
You're happy with our relationship right?
You and your idiom artwork!
Call me nasty, but the joke's over. Get that thing out of here.
I'm glad THAT'S done. Now, should we get delivery confirmation?
It must be the welcoming gift from that party you think you belong to.
Its not my problem
I'm glad we solved our problem.
Oh, that elephant in the living room.
I think we've talked about it enough.
Anything you need to tell me?
I don't care if he's endangered, he's taking up our entire living room
can we at least order the peanut sauce on the side this time?
I told you we needed to talk!
I know you don't want to talk about it, but I think the elephant in the room is the elephant in the room.
I guess now the shit's really going to hit the fan.
I'm just going to come out and say it. You're a Republican, aren't you?
Whew... did you fart?
Goddamn Craigslist!
I told you he'd grow too big for a Manhattan walk-up.
We've seen that face before, haven't we?
I think we should talk about the elephant in the room.
I still think it's better than a tiger.
I refuse to acknowledge the Trump voters in the room.
We need to talk.
If he raises his tail, it's time for evacuation.
I don't know why I'm thinking of him, but, really, the Republican candidate is simply an ass.
They will never let us bring our little Pixie on the plane !
But I don't want him to keep government out of my life.
I swear it's not political. I'm really leaving you.
It's time to tell him to move his butt out of here.
seriously? you want to talk about the elephant?
It's a Trojan Elephant.
Let's hope his poop is just as easy to ignore.
I told you that elephant egg was a good investment...
Trump told him to go back to Kenya.
He does not want to be seen until the elections are over.
How many 800 lb gorillas do you see?
Time for walkies.
Could we at least talk about it?
Say, whatever happened to your pet elephant, Steven?
I don't care whether it's an Indian or African elephant, Charles.
Honestly, with the amount this dumbo was hyped up, I expected smaller hands..
No... I mean literally there is an elephant in the room...
Are you trying to tell me something?
I said a parakeet, or a goldfish, but N-O-O-O, you said this was the winner!
Who does he think he is, Trump???
You can thank your buddies at PETA for banishing them from Ringling Brothers.
I don't want to talk about it.
You didn't buy the litter?
No, I don't want to talk about the you-know-what in the you-know-where.

He wouldn't get so big if you didn't make hay out of very little thing.
No, I don't wish to discuss an unresolved issue. There is an actual elephant in the room.
Either that ... or we have to get a bigger room.
I want you to call Mr. Trump and tell him this not funny.
So, when are we going to talk about the Trump in the room?
Are you going to bring it up, or shall I?
If he does, you have to clean it up.
I guess the elephant in the room isn't Trump anymore
He'll just have to learn how to clean up after himself.
You know, a donkey will make a much more stable companion
Think of it as a conversation piece for all the stuff you don't want to talk about.
We really need to talk about this rug.
Honey, even in the elephant knows that you're in denial!
The headlines are bad enough but it's these rump lines that really terrify me!
Okay, let's get the obvious stuff out of the way...
You think we really should talk about what..?
OK, we'll talk. But only because i really can't keep up with all the elephant poop.
Alright, so what do you want to talk about first?
Damn you, Jeff Koons.
Seriously its in the room!
I don't know if you noticed, dear, but the taxidermist dropped something off for you today.
Are they changing their logo?
I think it's your turn to walk him - and none too soon!
Don't look at him. Just ignore him.
I’m afraid we’ll lose sight of each other.
The elephant in the room, or a pachyderm in the White House. Pick you poison.
I knew I shouldn't have allowed you to attend that Trump rally without me.
He wouldn't get so big if you didn't make hay out of every little thing.
Ethel and Frank were happy to ignore the elephant in the room, but soon when he pooped things would change.
A pet like that doesn't have to be eaten all at once.
Does this mean you are voting for Republican?
Honey, this is hardly bipartisanship.
His rump looks kind of like Trump.
So are you going to ask him if he's voting for Trump or am I?
Do you think it's available in Orange Chiffon?

We need to talk ...
Obviously our never-speak-about-it issue has now become a giant cliche.
No, you're the one choosing to ignore the the room around the elephant.
This is one elephant in the room we need to talk about.
Do you think he's over that indigestion?
If it farts we're toast Honeybunch
Let me guess you're a Republican
What did you do with my donkey?
I hope to God he's house trained.
Is this your subtle way of telling me you need more space?
Apartment below hates tap dancing.
in spite of what you heard, he always forgets to wipe his feet
So now we're ignoring two GOP icons?
I feel like there's a 165 pound human in the room.
So, to summarize; rug, painting, lamp, chairs, curtains, newspaper. Right?
Is it too late for buyer's remorse?
There's something we need to talk about.
Wrong again...it's supposed to be a gorilla!
In this election, the Republicans have really showed their . . .
We can't ignore the issue--how do you feel about shovels?
I feel like there's something we're not talking about.

When the say the 'elephant in the room,' I didn't think they were serious.
I'll say it: The apartment is just too small.
Please tell me you remembered to pack his tuskbrush.
He's not house trained?
We can talk about it all we want, dear, but who's going to move it?
Ok, let's talk now about the elephant in the room.
Sometimes I need to show up so the saying doesn't lose affect.

Adorable at the Animal Rescue Center, but not so practical.
Well, it does take our minds off of political polarization.

We need to talk

Are we ready to talk about it yet?
I don't want to talk about it.
We hope he'll deflate before Election Day.

So... did I tell you about my new pet elephant?
if he raises his tail better start running
Could we please talk about why I am in this room?
Her parents aren't getting along and he called her fat and disgusting. Can't we just keep her here for awhile until she's feeling safe again?
Not another word about him.
Who's that guy running against Hillary?
You push Republican but I just see Dumbo.
I think it's time we had a discussion
Yes, it's YUGE, but I'm still not voting for Trump.
Do you smell something?
Honey, it’s not that I don’t like him but the peanut shells on the floor drive me crazy.
Sam, it's time to talk about a bigger apartment if we're going to keep avoiding this problem.

This thing is house-trained, right?
I'm fine. I'm just wondering if you asked whether he's house trained?
He prefers if we use the term ""800-pound gorilla".
Why can't we talk about it?
Just ignore it, and it will go away!
The donkey wouldn't have blocked the natural light.
He says he thought he wanted to be in the room where it happens but now he just wants to start a TV network. Maybe you can show him out. He doesn't seem to listen to women.
He's a great distraction until our furniture arrives.
Yes I love baby elephants, I'm just saying this one has grown a lot.
Don't worry - He's house-trained....
At couples therapy this week, can we PLEASE discuss the elephant in the living room?

This wasn't what I meant by Safari.

We already solved the problem. Why did you have to bring him into the room?
This is why the litter box needs hourly cleaning!
Honey, we got such a great bargain. I only paid for the ivory!
