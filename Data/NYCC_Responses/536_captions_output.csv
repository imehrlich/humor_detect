Sometimes a dipstick is just a dipstick.
The impotence, that feeling of being out of control when you find yourself parallel parking against your will, probably started when you were being assembled.
I'd like to see you again in two thousand miles.
I'm afraid we're out of time, but I'd like to see you again in 5,000 miles …
And was this your first breakdown?
Where do the voices tell you to go?
So you're no longer attending your AAA meetings?
And are the clowns inside you now?
I don't think I'm charging you enough.
We have to end for today, but I've set your next session for 3 months or 3,000 miles, whichever comes sooner.
I just can't seem to control my emissions.
Wait, back up.
My father had a checkered past.
Lots of cars fall in love with their mechanic. It's called transmission.
Tell me about your last breakdown.
You got yourself here. That's a good start.
And how many clowns do you think are inside you *right now*?
My mother was an Escort.
I believe you are expeeriencing Prius envy.
Back up a moment
Let's back up.
I know this is unprofessional, but could you drop me home after our session?
These voices inside - do they always tell you where to go?
When did you first realize you had a fear of clowns?
Premature acceleration?
It's a classic case of Prius envy.
So tell me about these auto erotic fantasies.
I don't take auto insurance.
I'm tired of being the "smart" car. The girls all go for the muscle cars.
Let's go back to the day you found out you were pre-owned.
In your case I think a fear of clowns is perfectly rational.
And you feel that the road never hugs you in return?
And do you consume ethanol on a daily basis?
Would you describe yourself as a self-starter?
First of all, do you have insurance?
Well, I can validate your feelings, but not your parking.
You can break down if you need to.
I'm afraid we're out of time. Is someone coming to pick you up?
Well, problems may appear larger in your rearview.
You bet I'm going to charge you.
How much baggage could you possibly have?
Tell me more about your auto body experience.
Let's shift gears for a moment.
My longest relationship only lasted six blocks.
So tell me what drove you here
How long have you felt you don't know where to turn?
What drove you into therapy?
Look, the squirrel had choices...
Let's back up for a minute.
Well, our time's up here, any chance you are heading toward downtown?
If they trust me, why do I have a steering wheel?
How long have you been afraid of clowns?
That voice you hear in your head? It's the radio.
Would you describe yourself as self-driven?
How long have you had these feelings that you are being controlled by others?
Let's talk about why you automatically lock everyone out.
All my life they said, "Porsche's the pretty one, you're the smart one."
Unfortunately, we don't accept car insurance.
Have you tried turning yourself off and on again.
So, what really turns you on?
It's a clinical condition we refer to as Prius Envy.
Tell me more about the nightmare with the clowns.
Have you tried turning yourself off and then on again?
He just sits in you and does nothing?
Let's talk about your tendency to avoid things.
Do you mind, just this session, if we talk about something other than the road less traveled?
Sure, you're a smart car. But are you a happy car?
So let's be clear. This voice inside you tells you not only where to go but how to get there?
Tell me about your control issues.
Please put the reverse camera on and look at me when I talk to you.
Yes, Prius envy is very common.
How many clowns?
I think you could benefit from an AAA meeting.
I’m sorry but I don’t accept AAA.
The next half hour is free if you can give me a ride to the airport afterwards.
I'd like to work on your "my way or the highway" attitude.
That many clowns would frighten anyone.
We have to stop now. Could you run me uptown?
It's nothing to be ashamed about. Prius Envy is actually quite common.
This is a classic case of Prius envy.
Have you considered the possibility that these "accidents" might actually by your fault.
Seriously, if you don't cut back on the ethanol, I can't help you.
Given your history, the fear of clowns is more than understandable. But could you say you just feel 'so used' in general?
I'm a Smart Car, but I'm not living up to my potential
You've got a classic case of Prius envy.
I'm afraid you are suffering from Prius envy.
You're supposed to have avoidance issues.
Reframe it. You're not driverless. You're self-driven. Big difference.
Tell me more about your control issues.
Are you finding these emissions are primarily nocturnal?
Did you have any trouble finding my office?
Do you think perhaps you're being Uber sensitive?
Blue Book cannot determine your true self-worth.
It's perfectly normal, we all have gas.
So let's delve further into this fear of clowns
Sometimes a tunnel is just a tunnel.
Let's talk about your autoeroticism.
You are a Smart Car; figure it out.
It appears you lack self-control.
Have you been skipping your AAA meetings again?
You've got a surprising amount of baggage.
Just how long have you been cheating on your emission tests?
Self-driving will not make you go blind.
Our hour is up, I recommend we meet again in 3,000 miles.
You seem to be headed for a breakdown.
There's nothing driving me anymore.
Obviously, you're just not driven.
Why don’t you let people in?
What's more important to you -- performance or size?
I feel like I'm going through life on autopilot
And how long have you felt this Prius envy?
"Nocturnal emissions? Really, nothing to worry about".
I understand, but first you really have to WANT to change lanes.
Your father was a gas guzzler?
If you want to get anywhere, you're going to have to let me in.
It's not size that matters -- it's how long you can hold your charge.
I think you might be overreacting. Sometimes a honk is just a honk.
The reason you're a wreck is because your father was a gas-guzzler and your mother was hooked on speed!
I've lost all sense of direction.
Have you tried switching yourself off and on again?
Let's back up a little.
I am sorry I don't accept EZ Pass as a form of payment.
You can come out now, Mr. Schwartz. The car isn't going to do the talking for you.
Sorry. Accepting a ride from you would be completely unprofessional.
Come back in 3,000 miles.
If you let that many clowns inside you, you're bound to feel guilty.
So what you're saying is, you have some sort of auto-immune disorder?
Do you see yourself as self-driven?
Our hour is up. Do you need me to validate your parking....?
NO. I DON'T WANT TO CHECK YOUR DIP STICK!
Yes, we validate.
They expect me to drive myself, but they never ask me where I want to go.
I don't know what happened. I used to be so driven.
And do these voices also tell you to commit moving violations?
Have you tried asking the clowns to take their shoes off before getting in?
Poor thing ... you've got Prius envy.
I believe you're suffering from Prius envy.
And when did you first realize you were a hybrid?
So, you say you have Prius-envy . . .
So let's talk about your Prius Envy...
I cannot live up to the hype. My parents were both smart cars.
There's the id, the ego, and the Uber-ego.
You don't seem driven.
Is your back up camera looking at my legs?
You have an unusual case of Prius Envy.
There's no such thing as "Prius Envy."
What are these voices telling you to do?
Prius envy is completely normal at your age
I'm going to prescribe a battery of lithium.
It could be Prius envy.
She said she needed more space.
I think we've been down that road before.
So at what point did you realize there was no driver?
Tell me about these nocturnal emissions.
You're going to have to learn to control yourself.
It's normal to feel empty inside.
Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.
I had the dream about the clowns again.
I have helicopter parents.
We all have our blind spots.
Self-driving doesn't mean self-actualized.
Don't beat yourself up too much -- even a Smart car can do dumb things.
I used to feel driven, now I just feel used.
I keep having this dream that someone is trying to control me.
Tell me about your checkered past
Let's talk about your control issues.
And we'll see you again in 3,000 miles or the next incident, whichever comes first.
Well you don't appear to me to be carrying a lot of baggage.
Exactly when did you begin to feel you had no need for people
You're not really lazy — you're just shiftless.
You're smart. But are you happy?
It sounds like you have some control issues.
Everybody has a blind spot.
It seems to me you have serious control issues.
You're not the first clown car to cry on the inside.
So, you sometimes feel that there are... people inside of you. Small people. Controlling you. Making you go places you wouldn't otherwise go. Is that it?
Lets talk more about your control issues.
I think you may be driving yourself too hard.
At some point we all have to unlock our doors and let people in.
Can you give me a lift home after our session?
First, you have to admit that you have an emission problem.
She says we should start parking together, but I need my own space.
I might be more helpful if you allow me to work on you from under the couch.
You may be the first self-loathing car, too.
No need to feel guilty about tooting your own horn.
How long have you had your fear of clowns?
And why don't you think you're a smart car?
Yes, I would consider that a Fordian slip.
Who turns you on?"
And was that first lube job consensual?
I am not here to tell you where to go.
Everyone gets lost in Brooklyn
Before we begin, I just want you to know we don't validate parking.
And you think having a middle finger would help?
And this voice inside, does it tell you to do other things than turn?
Most days I feel like I'm just spinning my wheels.
Tell me how you fuel.
If you leave the psychiatry to me, then I'll leave the driving to you.
You say he left you for a Tesla?
Are you saying you don't feel smart because you think you look dumb?
I want to be a clown car... but I feel empty inside.
So what drove you to seek therapy?
Before we get started, I need to mention some problems with your insurance.
It's important you don't confuse depression with a low battery.
I guess my troubles started when I found out my mother was a rental car.
From where I sit, I'd say you have more of a gas problem.
And where do YOU want to go?
So, just when did he leave you for a newer model?
Look, nobody likes to lose that new car smell.
Are you just here for validation?
Start with when you first recognized that you're a hybrid.
Would you say you're no longer driven by other people?
Yes, I do validate parking
Maybe it's time you stop and ask for directions
So the cars in the commercials seem much larger, and the women driving them much happier. Go on.
No, I don't take E-Z Pass.
Do you feel as though you lack auto autonomy?
I can help you, but it's only good for 90 days or 3000 miles, whichever comes first.
I encourage you to toot your own horn now and then.
So, self control. Tell me more about the stain in the driveway.
I can't help if you won't let me under your hood.
What brought you here today?
You need to accept that you're in the driver's seat now.
Tell me more about your recurring dream. Do you still wake up screaming every time the band plays “Send in the Clowns? "
So, have you thought about where YOU want to go?
I guess I've taken a few wrong turns in life.
Listen, nobody finds their way around Brooklyn the first time
And you feel having all those clowns cram inside of you is the reason you haven't been able to start up?
Maybe you're driving yourself too hard.
What drove you to get help
It’s perfectly natural to feel rejected and empty inside. After all, 37 clowns did trade you in for a Prius.
Let's explore your desire to live life in the fast lane.
You seem to have issues with self-control.
I'm sorry but I can't validate your parking.
Tell me more about that 'clown' inside you. What is he saying to you now?
I think it's time for you to take a hard look in the rear-view mirror.
Wait . . . you feel like there are how many clowns inside you just waiting to get out?
You were giving the wrong signals....
It's about the journey.
It's always 'turn left, turn right,' never 'follow your dreams Carl.'
Tell me, what brings you here?
Your oil has to want to change.
And in your dream, had you studied for your carbon emission test?
You dream of how many clowns?
Tell me the dream about the clowns again.
You are still smart, just not Uber smart.
I can assure you that no one is driving you insane.
Your problems obviously stem from issues with your motherboard.
I'm so confused....I don't know which way to turn.
Ever since the recall, I've just felt like a part of me is missing.
You may find this session very troubling, so I hope you have someone to drive you home.
How do you see yourself going forward?
I just want to be told I'm a smart car.
It's not just a label! You are a smart car.
But which self is driving now?
When we're done can you take me home?
It all started with a bunch of clowns.
You're going to have to give me some sort of signal.
As you get older, it's natural that you have a harder time holding a charge.
Tooting your own horn is perfectly normal for a car your age.
Do you consider yourself driven?
I'm hearing a lot of suppressed road rage.
You have Acceleration Deficit Disorder .
Now, tell me about these auto-erotic tendencies.
Blaming everything on your motherboard isn't very productive.
Premature acceleration is very common with your model.
When did you lose your sense of direction?
Not everyone is cut out for life in the fast lane.
So, tell me more about those voices you hear inside.
And how long have you had this fear of clowns?
If I can't get you to open up to me, then how am I going to get home?
Siri told me to get lost.
What makes you think your parents wanted an SUV?
You're fine, get over it, now take me home.
Sure - I pick up lots of women but it never turns into anything meaningful.
We don't care what your meter says, 50 minutes is an hour.
Performance issues?
Can we talk a little more about these control issues?
I hate to cut you off.
Let's get back to your control issues
I'm sorry, but only a manufacturer can prescribe premium unleaded
Of course I could stop if I wanted to.
I need a new Lithium prescription.
In retrospect, all the signs were there.
I just... don't feel as driven as I used to.
Tell me more about these control issues...
So let's just back up a bit..... No, don't!
It sounds like you are struggling with control issues.
I can certainly prescribe a change of tires, but is that why you really came to see me?
Let's begin by exploring what drove you to drive yourself here.
And when did the voices in your dashboard start?
Sure I'm in control, but I'm not driven.
Oh, I am not a doctor or writing notes. This is a parking ticket.
People think I'm shiftless
Now, when you say you were jumped - where did he put the cable?
So, what brought you in today?
I think this is a classic case of Prius envy.
Well, let's start with how you got here.
The cruel irony, doc, is I have no idea where I'm going in life.
Prius envy is not uncommon in your make and model.
She hasn't touched my dipstick in over 5,000 miles.
Decreases in drive and appetite are quite normal for a hybrid.
Why do you think you have such trouble taking directions?
And you hear these voices only when you're driving?
And has your family been supportive as you transition into an all electric?
Maybe you shouldn't drive yourself so hard.
You're a 2009 and she's a 2016?
And what did you learn from lying on your emissions tests?
These nightmares you're having...is It always clowns?
Do you think your father's history of gas guzzling affected his reaction when you came out as electric?
Prius envy?
I'm fine, really. It's just cheaper to park here.
Not everyone can be a self-starter
Let me see if I got this right: your father is from Detroit and your mother is from Silicon Valley.
She left me for a stretch limo. How am I supposed to feel?
Elaborate on the time you asked someone for directions.
And whose voice is it that you hear saying you're not a smart car?
Yes, I can see how a fear of clowns makes your job challenging.
I'm just not driven like I used to be.
OK, you're small, but you are a smart car and you drove yourself here. Doesn't that make you feel good?
And you say these voices keep telling to you to drive yourself?
I feel like she just used me to get from A to B, y'know?
Tell me more about "feeling like there's a clown inside trying to get out."
When did you start claiming to be a Hummer online?
Do you ever feel empty inside?
You aren't alone. Few of us understand what's really driving us.
And the voices tell you to go where?
I gotta be honest, Doc, I don't know where I'm goin'
I'm sorry to tell you, its an auto immune disorder.
Don't worry. Auto-erotic dreams are perfectly normal for someone your age.
Feeling empty?
How long have you had these auto-erotic fantasies?
I've kept these emissions bottled up for so long.
So what brings you here?
Now tell me ... exactly how long have you wanted to be a toaster?
The term “smart car” can create unrealistic expectations.
I had a nocturnal emission.
I feel great, but my gas pedal is often depressed.
So tell me, when did you realize you were headed in the wrong direction.
Autoeroticism, I'd say.
Let go of that guilt. Lube jobs are a healthy and normal part of your life.
Don't worry. Nobody understands roundabouts.
As a confidence builder, try not coming here by bus
So you think your problem is size, or lack of drive?
I have a recurring nightmare about clowns
So all those clowns make you feel funny inside?
I think you're headed for a breakdown.
So why do you feel you always need to toot your own horn?
Can you find your own way out?
Sometimes a gas nozzle is just a gas nozzle.
Remember, it's not your size, it's what you do with it.
You'll find tissues in the glove compartment.
And when did this fear of clowns begin?
Yes, tell me more about your gas guzzling father.
Don't worry, nocturnal emissions are totally legal.
Just once, I'd like to tell everybody else where to go.
Let's return to your first oil change.
Ma'am, I'm just here to pick you up.
How long have you had these feelings of Prius envy?
If your emissions are good, size won't be a problem
Relax, just because your battery is bi-polar, doesn't mean you are.
How did you get to the 8th floor?
Well, what used to drive you?
Sounds like you have control issues.
So, you drove down the road not taken and then what?
Well I think any car that can drive itself to my office and parallel park on my couch is a very smart car indeed.
It just feels like I took a wrong turn sonewhere along the way.
First, we need to work on figuring out what drives you.
Electrical dysfunction is nothing to be ashamed of.
Let's talk about the dream where you're running over pedestrians.
She just doesn't turn me on like she used to.
When exactly did your fear of clowns begin?
The consultation is complementary, but the parking is $150 an hour.
Do you think you lack drive? Or direction?
I think being zero emissions is causing you to hold too much inside.
Tell me more about not feeling driven.
The first thing I want to check is your lithium level.
It's called Prius Envy, if you must give it a name.
So you say your parents were driven. How do you feel about that?
What makes you think your concerns are pedestrian?
So how long have you self-identified as a toaster?
Frankly, I don't think you need a shrink.
I'd like to address your repressed emissions.
Perhaps a new outlet would help.
Sounds like Prius envy.
This "collision avoidance" sounds like a defense mechanism.
When did you find out your parents were gas guzzlers?
He called you a toaster. You showed him your headlights. Then what?
Let’s first rule out mechanical causes.
So, what brings you here today?
No, really, you need to let the child inside you come out. It's not enough to crack the window.
You are valued, regardless of what Consumer Reports says.
So, you feel as though the clowns are driving you crazy.
Your uber is clearly in conflict with your id.
First, I'll need your VIN.
Let's talk about your self-control issues.
Sometimes you just need to unplug.
So, we're having control issues, are we?
Let's start with some relaxation techniques. Shutoff your headlights, release your emergency brake and slowly lower your tire pressures.
Can I ask you to back up a little there
Strive for autonomy, but remember to let people in.
"I'm sorry but 'That's how I roll' is not the answer to every question.
Autoerotica isn't always a bad thing.
How long have you had these dreams about clowns?
Do you want to pay by cash, check or EZ Pass?
It sounds to me like you know exactly where you want to be, but you just don't know how to get there.
I'm sorry, was that one beep or two?
I wet the garage again.
How long have you had this shiftless feeling?
I understand you're feeling used.
I'm just not driven.
Before we begin, I'm obligated to remind you that the meter is running.
What do you think is driving you?
So, you no longer have the drive?
It appears that you may be dealing with a control issue.
Let's begin by talking about those blind spots.
It's OK to toot your own horn!
'Piston envy is a common stage.'
What did we say about honking? Use your words.
Don't take it personally; kicking tires is just something people do.
And when did you first realize you were afraid of clowns?
So, when did you become self driven?
So, tell me when you first noticed your driver was missing.
I think you can find your way out.
Tell me about your relationship with your driver
When did you first feel lost?
Ignore them—you look nothing like a toaster.
Today I'd like to try some reverse psychology.
What's the problem? I lot of people hate clowns.
So, it sounds like you are feeling like you really need to shift gears.
You're not the first self-driving car to experience road rage.
Think back to when you were just a little search engine...
How did you feel when you found out you weren't actually born in Detroit?
Tell me about your hood, child.
It's okay to be high maintenance.
Tell the circumstances that led to your first breakdown.
My initial charge is $250 for the first hour, plus $50 for each additional 1/5 of an hour.
These "voices inside you"...are they A.M. or F.M.?
So you're not feeling driven?
Do you fear autonomy?
Let's begin. What can you tell me about what drove you here?
You say you're here because of an irrational fear of catching an auto-immune disease?
So your main problem is a lack of drive?
What makes you think your father was a toaster?
I don't know.....I just seem to have lost my sense of direction.
Some days you're the windshield, some days you're the bug.
Yes, what you call "Googling yourself" is autoerotic.
You're suffering from Prius envy.
I really don't think you should take it personally when they kick your tires.
I sense that you are honking on the inside.
You feel empty...driven.
My professional opinion? You're driving yourself crazy.
Tell me more about how you feel people are taking you for a ride.
Please stop saying that you know where my questions are going.
So when did your fear of clowns first occur?
I get car sick.
What makes you think he'll leave you for another model?
If you’re not in control of where you’re going, then no one is.
How long have you been taking different people home every night?
Doctor, my problem is I no longer feel driven.
So you were manufactured as a car,but you identify as a toaster?
Face it, Porsche's gone. She was out of your league anyway.
And when did you first get this feeling that you have an autoimmune disease?
"Don't belittle yourself. You ARE a Smart Car.......
I give up. How many clowns can you hold?
My meter's running, too, you know.
And how many clowns were there?
You're very self-driven
Well, we've come to the end of our session. Do you need your parking validated?
By now you know you can't carry a lot of excess baggage.
Let's begin with your bad dreams. How many clowns are jumping out of you?
Not the clown car dream again?
Focus less on being self-driving, and more on being self-driven
How long have you been fueling this way?
Why do you say 'I don't feel driven anymore'?
At what point did you see yourself as the little engine that couldn't?
Where do you think this need to be controlled is coming from?
Would you describe your parents as driven?
Let me guess – you feel like your life is on auto-pilot.
Let's start with how you got here.
It sounds like you're driving yourself crazy.
You know, being self driven doesn't mean you can't feel lost.
Tell me more about feeling empty inside.
It's sounds like you feel like nothing is driving you.
i think you're having control issues
I just feel like I've lost all my drive.
I am self-driving, but my owner just refuses to give up control.
"After losing your driver it is only natural to grieve".
So Freud would have called it Prius envy?
I'm not sure what we can do about your Prius envy
Let's get past the small stuff. I'd appreciate it if you could park facing me.
When did you first notice that you were losing your drive?
To begin with, just what makes you think you're so Smart?
I would say you have a case of piston envy.
Tell me about how you got here.
So how long have you had this obsession with auto-eroticism?
It's perfectly normal to have gas problems.
Tell me more about your breakdown on 43rd Street.
So this week I want you to try going one day without maps.
I feel people are just using me.
I can't help you if you won't let me in.
..and that's when I found out I was adopted, and my real mother is a toaster.
Only you can change your direction.
Why do you feel you need everyone to think you are smart?
Think of it as 'parkability', not 'size matters'.
Are you sure it's gas?
And would you describe yourself as "driven"?
You could've had a V8.
Mechanical reassignment as a toaster involves many issues. Naturally, I'm here to counsel with you and help clarify the correct path for expressing your true self.
2 honks for yes, 1 honk for no
How long have you felt that you lacked direction?
Well you obviously know what's troubling you -- I mean, you're clearly a Smart Car.
When did you first stop having fahrvergnügen?
But you are a clown car.
Autoerotic fantasies are quite normal in a self-driving car.
When did you first experience this loss of drive?
You are an autonomous self-driving car, an autodidactic autopilot. It is only natural to feel autoerotic, but you should draw the line at autotheism.
So, did you have any trouble finding the place?
It's just that everyone around me is so driven.
I just feel like my life has already been mapped out for me.
Maybe you just can't go there.
You've been driving yourself crazy.
Tell me about what turns you on.
That will be $100 for the first five minutes, and then $10 for each additional minute.
The first group session of clown therapy is always a bit awkward
Why do you think your 'search engine' light keeps coming on?
I think you need direction.
What do you mean your meter is running?
Take a vacation. Unplug. Recharge.
Growing up, my dad was on the road a lot.
Was it the amount of clowns inside you, or that everyone just stood and watched?
I think I'm driving myself crazy.
I think if you're ever going to be truly happy, you'll need to focus less on your crash safety issues, and focus more on your wonderful fuel efficiency, and ability to make people laugh.
We all wish we were in a better cartoon.
It's normal to get turned on when you're plugged in.
So you feel guilty passing gas?
I hear you saying that sometimes you don't know which way to turn.
Yes , we're on the meter
What drives you?
And how often do you have this dream of plowing into a crowd of computer programmers?
"Normally I just do nervous breakdowns".
I think with a few more sessions we can get you turned around.
Beyond intimacy and fuel efficiency, are there other issues you need to discuss?
It's normal to feel directionless at times
Your service plan allows only two more visits. I'm sorry.
Would you describe yourself as driven?
Sometimes it can be helpful to think about what it is that drives you...
My life feels like it's on autopilot.
And why do you want to be a Crossover?
Perhaps they're laughing with you.
Say more about these nocturnal emissions.
I just don't know where I'm going anymore.
Frankly, your issues are all pedestrian.
When did you first start having these feelings that no one was in charge
Why don't you let me steer the conversation?
Doc, I don't know which way to turn
As green as your life is, an occasional nocturnal emission is perfectly normal.
I just can't stop looking in the rear view mirror.
These nocturnal emissions--when did they begin?
This is an unloading zone.
There is just so much pressure these days to be self-driven.
It's okay to be driven.
It's natural to feel empty at times.
I know it's hard, but you can't go around avoiding everyone
It's not uncommon for near-death accidents to result in an auto-body experience.
Sometimes I just feel the need for someone else to be in control.
It sounds like you're sending all the wrong signals.
I guess, you won't need your parking validated.
"No worries. It's supposed to last longer than four hours." .
Tell me what keeps you up idling at night.
You have to stop driving yourself so hard
Next week let's work on being more self-driven.
I drive myself crazy.
Tell me more about your gas problem.
You say you have Prius envy?
At your age, it's perfectly normal to experience occasional feelings of autoeroticism.
One thing I have never lacked is motivation, I've always been completely self-driven
Prius envy, plain and simple.
You don't always need to be so self-driven.
I don't seem to be getting where I want to go
You have to understand that just because you are a smart car you do not always make wise decisions.
She left you for a stretch limo?
Do you know the warning lights for depression?
Why don't you let someone else take control for a change?
Just because you have a short wheelbase, doesn't mean you're inadequate.
She treats me like a toy.
When did you start having these breakdowns?
I feel like I've been going through life on autopilot
Well, I think we can rule out Prius envy.
Problems with your dipstick are very common at your age.
So how long have you been autoerotic?
You seem to have control issues.
We need to talk about your control issues.
Many women feel size doesn't matter at all.
take your time....the meter's running....
You feel your life lacks direction?
Sure, you have drive. What about empathy?
Your ego and uber-ego are in conflict.
Dig deeper. Who's in the driver's seat?
Yes, but what really drives you?
Nice parking job.
When did you first experience Prius envy?
Why do YOU think your air bags are inflating too soon?
I'm sure your driver misses you as well.
In your case, autoeroticism is perfectly normal.
I suggest you just take some time off to recharge your batteries.
Hummer fantasies are nothing to be ashamed of.
I know Bruce Jenner did it, but he didn't want to be a truck.
We need to work on your control issues.
Remember, you're not 'Driverless', you're 'Self-driving'.
You should take some time off to recharge your battery.
You're still smart; you've just taken some wrong turns.
So, tell me, who pushes your buttons?
From what I'm hearing, you seem to resent always being called the "smart car" and never the "pretty car".
You have Car Pool Tunnel Syndrome, not uncommon for a commuter car.
It's ok to be smart.
That doesn't make you a control freak.
When I said I was going to charge you, I didn't mean....oh, dear....
You know, in most parts of the world you would be considered average sized.
I don't take insurance, but there's a discount if you have AAA.
I don't know, Doc... I guess I figured you knew what it's like to carry everyone else's baggage.
Every time I think we are getting somewhere she slams on the brakes.
So your husband left you for a newer model?
Sorry, I don't validate.
You don't feel you need someone to turn you on?

First things first, will this be billed to your auto or health plan?
Frankly, I think you're being Uber sensitive.
You'll be fine. You'd fit in anywhere.
If I were a Jungian I'd call it Prius envy.
Why do you feel you have difficulty accommodating people?
I can never see my gas tank as half full, you know?
What do you think having a stick shift will give you that you don't already have now?
No, you don't have to be driven to succeed
Gary, a check-engine light can mean so many things.
Sometimes I think to myself, "Jesus, take the wheel."
Tell me some more about your Uber ego.
Beeping your own horn gets you the wrong type of attention.
It's really less about your ego and more about your über-ego.
Let's get down to what really drives you.
I'm sensing a lot of road rage.
I'm referring you to a specialist in autoeroticism.
I think you are just being uber sensitive.
I'm not only self-driving, I'm also self-loathing.
Now, back up a minute!
Small tires don't always mean a small tailpipe.
You don't get turned on much anymore?
Drive me here, drive me there, I think they are all driving me crazy.
Tell me about your first passenger.
Perhaps you should stop googling yourself.
So, tell me what brings you here besides Google maps?
Don't you think it's time you started taking responsibility for your actions?
Every night I dream that I go to work and I'm not wearing any tires.
I just feel like I need a brake.
Interesting... I think that what you just did there is a perfect example of a Ford-ian slip.
I have emissional problems.
Happiness is a journey, not a destination...
Where does the voice inside you tell you to go?
I have Prius envy
And I take it you didn't think you needed to stop and ask for directions?
You shouldn't be too concerned. Many cars your age have uncontrolled emissions from time to time.
I don't know Doc, I just don't feel driven.
For future reference, we do validate parking.
I'm sorry we don't administer electric shock therapy any longer.
Before I ask you how that made you feel, I need to advise you we've hit peak hours and my rate has increased by 2.2x.
well, i'll see you in another five thousand miles.
Do you have any hobbies besides driving?
Sometimes I think I'm just driving myself crazy.
And do you feel that you're not driven enough?
What do you think drives you?
Tell me more about your checkered past
And how long have you dreamed you were a toaster?
Sorry, I can't hear you when your window is up.
Before we start - are you sure you don't have an oil leak?
You have to take time for yourself and recharge.
The voices in your head would go away if you just shut off the radio.
Missing NPR's 'Car Talk' is not abnormal.
You have control issues.
Just face it. You can't always go your own way.
Would you say you are driving yourself to distraction?
Perhaps he doesn't caress your steering wheel anymore because you don't have a steering wheel anymore.
I just think I'm meant to do something other than deliver pizza.
And how did having a gas-guzzling mother make you feel?
You say you don't feel driven any more.
Being smart doesn't make you popular. Trust me, I know.
I'm driving myself crazy, Doc.
And when did these episodes of auto eroticism start?
So when did you discover that you're not a smart car?
Do you have any idea the pressure of being labeled "Smart" all your life?
Next week, bring in the clowns.
When we're done with this session can you give me a lift?
You can't live life on Autopilot
Four recalls?
I just don't feel driven.
How do you know your owner is Ubering other cars?
It sounds like textbook Prius envy.
"Self-driving needn't be shameful.'
And your tires. Are they under any kind of pressure?
I'm driving myself crazy.
You can have your parking validated when you leave.
But I don't FEEL smart.
Really, you've been driving yourself too hard.
Do you have any concept of where you are going?
Just don't let anyone try to control you.
I just always feel like I'm being followed.
You need direction
Sorry, I can't validate your parking.
The dream usually ends with me running an Amazon driver into a ditch.
Even though you have the world's largest search engine?
Tell me about it or not; the meter's running either way.
Don't worry. I am a member of both the AMA and the AAA.
Where do you really want to go?
Of course, in your case, the diagnosis would not be bi-polar, but hybrid.
My mother wanted a limo.
So you're convinced your mother was a toaster. Let's explore that.
Can you recall your worst recall?
How long have people been driving you crazy?
I don't think there's any reason that you should be ashamed to have a three-prong adapter.
You know, a lot of drivers prefer smaller cars.
I think the question you have to answer is: "Where do you want to go?"
I know you're upset, but we can't go down that road again.
It's perfectly normal to change gears in clutch situations.
I have trouble getting started.
So you're worried that he is going to trade you in for a younger model?
Where would you LIKE to go?
Trans, hybrid... you have to let go of labels.
Don't worry - everyone thinks their charger plug is too small.
When did you first feel you were driving yourself crazy?
You can do this on your own.
So tell me, were both your parents gas-guzzlers?
and why do you resent people telling you where to go?
You don't feel remotely connected to anything?
Yes, car pool tunnel syndrome is real, and I can help.
It should seem obvious, but you're driving yourself crazy.
You needn’t blush, I’ve seen small charging cords before.
I can drive myself; I can park myself; I get 85 miles per gallon, but no one fits inside.
Of course you're smart enough.
and when did you first notice there was no driver?
Would it be so bad if you actually were the smartest car in the room?
It's just a motor reflex
"I know this is emotional for you but please try to use your wipers as I am low on tissues".
No, I cannot validate your parking.
Your issues indicate a classic autoimmune disorder.
So tell me Mr. Ferrari, when did you realize you were adopted?
Honk twice if I'm getting too personal.
In your case, it's completely normal to not feel driven.
What are you driving at?
Perhaps we should talk about performance rather than size.
And how does it make you feel, when they call you "mini"?
If you could turn around we can get started.
Howard, there is more to life than getting from zero to 60
So, I understand you have issues of self control.
No, I don't charge by the mile.
And how did it make you feel, as a child, to be the 'smart car' in your class?
How long have you lacked any drive?
First of all, you're facing the wrong way.
At some point, we all have to learn to navigate the world on our own.
That's the end of our session, now go play in traffic
First, tell me how you got here.
I'm just not feeling driven anymore
You need to compensate for your feelings of inadequacy on the highway by focusing on your ability to squeeze into any parking space.
So let me get this straight, you want me to charge you?
Then what did he do after he rear-ended you?
I'm sorry, we don't accept E-ZPass.
Maybe you should ask your mother if she ever even met Herbie?
What I hear you saying is that you don't feel like a smart car.
So whose driving you crazy this week?
Our time is up for today, but for a quarter we could go another 15 minutes.
I don't think that Donald Trump means to deport cars built in Mexico, but you never know.
Hmm. . . and how did you feel that first time you saw the smoke coming out of your rear end?
I’m afraid you have confused self-driving with self-determination.
You say you need a charge, how about $200 per hour.
I can help only if the gasket you blew is metaphorical.
So you feel like there's nothing driving you anymore
Of course you may plug in, but that will be an additional charge.
Sometimes you're the driver, sometimes you're being driven. That's life.
I don't do validation.
I know it’s your job, but you can’t keep everything locked inside.
Size is not what matters. I'm sure you give great mileage.
So tell me what brings you here
It's not you, nocturnal emissions are standard for your model.
No, self-driving doesn't mean you are narcissistic.
We all miss a turn or two in life--let it go.
Yeah, well I guess 'self-driving' isn't the same as 'self-aware'.
You look exhausted.
Tell me what drives you.
As much as I'd like to go for a ride with you, I think that would be unethical.
Not everyone needs to be driven to succeed.
Lets talk more about your auto-erotic behaviour
I think you're just looking to be validated.
So you claim to remember the assembly line-tell me about that.
Many women actually prefer a smaller trunk.
I've been driving myself crazy, Doc
Is it all clowns or just a lot of clowns in one place?
No, we don't validate for the time parked here.
So you feel you're missing a driving force in your life?
Well actually, size matters
Yes there are many cars out there with bigger dipsticks, but so what?
You are not depressed, your batteries are too low.
You must accept being self-driven.
You're not small. You're compact.
So your dad said that you were caused by an accident?
Traffic makes me really horny.
I don't know, doc. I look around and I feel like everyone else is so much more driven than I am.
So they say "you're in the driver's seat" and then they question my every move.
I'm afraid I have never seen so severe a case of Prius envy.
I'm a smart car, I know I'm a smart car...
When did you become concerned you were driving yourself too hard?
Tell me more about your lack of drive.
When did you first develop the delusion that you were a toaster and not a car?
I feel like I need a brake.
I'm thinking those voices you hear could be Sirius.
Redirecting your desires is natural. It's called 'transmission.'
Have you considered letting someone else take the wheel?
Well, if you hate being stuffed with clowns, then it's time to take a long hard look at why you work for the circus in the first place.
Would I trust you with my life in heavy traffic? Oh look, our times up!
How long have you felt this lack of direction?
Frankly, I would call this an uber-reaction.
I feel I'm not in control of where I want to go...
Buying fuzzy dice will only remind you of him.

You would not imagine what people do when they do not have to drive
I've lost my will to drive.
It hurts so much when they ask, "what car will you be when you grow up?"
Let's talk more about your autoerotic fantasies.
I have Uber Problems.
Just because they don't touch your steering wheel doesn't mean you're unattractive.
You have to own your wrong turns and stop blaming your programming.
Recalling you doesn't necessarily mean they don't like you.
I wish I had more drive.
Sometimes people drive me crazy!
I think you're cute too but it's unethical to ride in my patients.
Have you considered slowing down?
You seem Uber upset.
So why is it you feel smarter than the other cars?
Remember, if one door closes another opens.
Maybe you should stop driving yourself so hard.
What makes you think your tailpipe is small?
How long have you had this fear of clowns?
It sounds like you're having a midsize crisis.
I lack self-control. Is that a problem?
So you were 9 when you began thinking your father was a gas guzzler..

Dad was a 1973 Cadillac Fleetwood. Mom, a '75 Chrysler Imperial. I think I'm adopted.
You've never felt the least bit driven?
Sometimes I feel like I have no drive.
Do you always feel the need to be in control?

I just don't think I'm that smart.

Forgot to ask, do you need validation?
Just getting here is a big step.
Tell me more about the nightmare you had, the one about nocturnal emissions.
When did you stop feeling smart?
Now, why don't we back up and start from the beginning.
Well, let me tell you what Freud says about fire engine dreams
Do you mind turning around so I don't have to look at your Smart ass?
So tell me, what drives you?
You have to decide whether you want to go forward or backward before I can help.
Remember...size is not that important.
Tell me more about your motherboard.
So it was only the term "self driving" that made you realize you had no self?
She said she needed a brake
So what do you think this dream of having a driver means?
I feel so used.
Have you considered that being so self driven is the reason you feel empty inside?
Normally my patients complain they want MORE autonomy.
Well, the meter's up. We'll have to stop for today.
Have you tried telling them where you want to go?
Well you wanted a shrink, didn't you?
You're smart, yes, but we're talking about your feelings.
I'm going to recommend some light reading. Pick up a copy of "The Little Engine That Could".
I've been having the car wash dream again.
Your Oil Blot test is causing me some concern.

As smart as you are, we still don't know what's driving you.
Sometimes I feel like I'm not in control of my own actions.
How long have you had these feelings of predestination?
I feel like there's a convertible trapped inside my body.
You've got to think of it as just a bump in the road.
Why not re-frame this as "driver-free" instead of "driverless?"
It sounds like you don't have enough outlets.
Well, why do you think you feel empty inside?
And how long have you had this issue with auto-eroticism?
If you are so smart ,why are you here?
Maybe your mother did say you looked like a toaster, but that isn't who you are on the inside.
I'm feeling used . . .
Let me just say that this was a great first session. While I knew you're a self-driving car, I didn't know that you are also so self-aware.
Why do you think you lack direction?
So, you told him you didn't need him anymore in that way and he left you for a bus?
I charge by the mile.
You have demonstrated incredible self-control.
I would recommend some time to just recharge your batteries.
You feel like there is someone inside of you yearning to get out ?
So, you don't feel driven?
You want someone else to take control - Let's explore that feeling.
So you are concerned that size matters?
You say she named you "Brad," she loved you, and then she totaled you?
You'll find your way soon enough.
And have you told your owner about the voices?
Seeing as your mother was a toaster and your father was a car, it seems understandable that you want to eject your driver.

And you think that if you had a driver, that feeling might go away?
And how did that make you feel when your own father cut you off?
Your clutch feels depressed, causing a lack of drive.
Really, your performance anxiety is nothing that can't be remedied by a good lube.
This is normal. Many transmotives have second thoughts about gear reassignment surgery. Removing your stick shift is a big step...
So who's driving you crazy?
So smart cars really DO dream of electric sheep?
We sometimes refer to this as the 'Oedipus Wreck' complex.
You probably need to recharge.
Sometimes I feel like my life is on autopilot.
So, you're saying that you have a fear of being stuffed with clowns.
You're obviously driven.
I'd like to start seeing you twice a week. Please keep in mind there is a $50 Peak Hour surcharge after 2 pm.
Drive to the store. Take me to work. Pick the kids up from school. I just can't take the demands anymore!

Tell me about your child seat.
... and when someone touches your steering wheel, how does that make you feel?
Any chance I can get a lift uptown?
Have you ever felt driven?
It's okay if you can't recall your last recall.
I know, I know, you're passionate. You're just not driven.
Cruise control is not a long term solution.
It's OK. You don't have to be driven.
So, what happens in the dream after the driverless Police car pulls you over?
How long has it been since you lost your drive?
You are not a Tesla, so get over it.
What makes you think your mother had an affair with a toaster?
Your father loved you Carl. Ambulances flee, that's what they do.
And that's when she left with an Uber?
The patient-therapist relationship would be improved if you weren't looking at me through your rearview mirror.
I think it's Uber anxiety.
It's because you lack direction.

I just don't seem to fit in. All my friends have drivers.
Do you have any other auto-immune symptoms?
SUVs get recalled, too.
How can you know how it feels to have fourteen clowns inside you at once?
You are perfectly normal. Small cars have small sticks.
Can you tell me when your desire of having a stick shift began?
Back up a second... What is driving you?
Does there have to be a destination?
Yes, I would say that a smart car that doesn't believe in global warming qualifies as an existential crisis.
But you have to want to change lanes.
Have you filed a missing persons report.
I said "Be your superego", not super Yugo.
I don't think it is actually God's voice you're hearing telling you where to go.
I don't care if you're all in there together; I still charge by the clown.
I just can't help feeling depreciated all the time.
He drinks. I drive.
It's like I can't turn off my inner sensor.
So, what DOES drive you?
You don't need a licensed professional anymore.
I just feel like I've lost what little drive I had.
Please tell me again about the back seat drivers?
You'll just have to learn to ignore that little voice inside of you.
What's wrong with being the smart one?
Ever get the feeling like you can never really unplug?
I feel like nothing is driving me.
I charge by the hour, not by the mile.
How often do you feel steered in the wrong direction?
And how does that make you steer?
"Self-driving" doesn't mean self-actualized. I'll see you again next week?
I'm a psychiatrist. If you've got gas, you should see a medical doctor.
It must be very difficult having such an overbearing GPS.
And do you still feel as though you're just being used to get from Point A to Point B?
I just wish the other cars would take me seriously. I'm a Smart Car, too.
So how long have you felt lost, without direction?
I should warn you, I bill by the mile.
So you prefer "driver-free", rather than "driver-less"?
I don't care if you are a big-time low carbon footprint celebrity, you still have to wipe your tires before you sit on my couch.
I lost my sex drive.
Tell me again about how you were viciously attacked by a horde of clowns.
Let's increase your lithium battery voltage to reduce those road rage incidents.
Maybe winning the Indianapolis 500 is not a realistic goal.
I'm uber depressed.
What sort of envy?
Have engineers always turned you on?
And how old were you when you started the working the streets?
When did you first feel that you were the smartest car in the room?
I'm self-driving, doc, but am I truly autonomous?
Tell me about your motor and father.
You're driving yourself again. No wonder you're back in therapy.
I have this terrible fear of clowns.
Tell me about these car dreams where no one is driving.
I still don't know how I got here.
Tesla, Tesla, Tesla - that's all they talk about!
The problem is, I can't tell whether I'm coming or going.
I just want someone to see me as something other than "smart"
I just can't do an analysis AND an oil change in just one hour.
Autonomous? But you've always been so driven.
I think you're misguided.
And when was the first time you noticed that you didn't have gas?
What makes you think they don't believe you're smart?
So you feel you've lost your drive.
Why do you think it is so important to you to be a "Smart" Car?
So, how long you been tooting your own horn?
If you're going to self-drive, you should probably avoid self-medicating.
Tell me more about your uber-bearing mother.
I know you are self-driving, but there's no shame in asking for directions!
So when the other cars called you toaster, how did that make you feel?
We're not going to get anywhere if you don't turn around--the headlights are the window to the soul, you know.
Believing you're "driving yourself crazy" may be the first sign that you are becoming self-aware.
You compensate by being smart.
No, in your case, it's not narcissistic to turn yourself on.
I see a scared little car who's self-driving and has no clue where he wants to go.
How long have you felt empty inside?
So, voices from outer space are telling when to turn?
You have all the signs of mechanic depression.
So, sometimes you feel like a driver-less child?
Is your meter running too?
.. but you're a rare example of being self-driven without any motivation..
We first need to get past your preoccupation with how I charge.
I agree, having 27 clowns packed inside you would be very stressful.
I suspect you are driving yourself crazy.
I just haven't felt the same since all those clowns left me.
Well, yes, but in your case bipolar is completely normal.
How are you fueling today?
Sure you're smarter than everyone else, but that doesn't always give you the right of way.
Sorry I'm late - Couldn't find a place to park!
I can't get started
I don't feel like Siri listens to me anymore.
I'm going to prescribe you some Ethanol
Well yes, in some cases, size does matter.
I don't want to see him but there are only so many charging stations.
Let's begin by discussing what's driving you
What brought me here? Apple Maps.
I understand your concern, Morris, but at some point, size does matter.
Just to let you know, my meter is now running.
Could my newfound self-control be driving him away?
It seems you are driving yourself too hard.
Sometimes we all feel that we have no sense of direction...
I always feel lost.
But I keep asking myself am I really autonomous
It's always the same, they come and go, use me for one thing.
I just have no drive.
Let's discuss your fear of finding yourself lost.
I thought you’d be open to taking Lithium.
"'Ubered' is not a recognized medical condition at this time".
No, you don't have multiple personalities. Those are clowns.
Feel free to let the conversation take us wherever you like.
So tell me, why do you think of your intelligence as being artificial?
What you're experiencing is known to humans as 'road rage.'
Sometimes I feel there's no one in the driver's seat.
you're not writing me a ticket, are you?
I feel like no one ever asks me where I want to go.
When did you first start getting fixations about clowns?
It's not about your passengers. It's about you.
Wait...you honked...because, you were horny?
I'm starting to feel like no one's in the driver's seat.
Yes, you're sending mixed signals, but that's not uncommon for hybrids; it's how you're wired.
What so upsets you about the slogan 'size matters?'
How did it make you feel being the smallest in your class?
So you feel your problems all stem from lack of guidance?

Well, it is natural to sometimes feel the need to be steered in the right direction.
What kind of body issues?
I wouldn't worry about size. You have a big battery.
I think you've been driving yourself too hard.
At this stage in life, you really should be self-driving.
So, you don't feel as driven as you used to be?
So, your brother is an SUV.

When they laughed at your crank shaft, how did that make you feel?
So would you say that your mother wasn't running on all cylinders?
To progress, we must analyze your autoerotic dreams.
Are you sure you haven't already seen a shrink?
Fitting in shouldn't be such an issue.
You're having issues with autonomy?
Driverless cars often feel empty.
I'm driving me crazy!!!
A hybrid personality is not necessarily a negative.
Yes Doc, I fear clowns.
Road rage is often caused by Prius Envy.
I never said you lacked drive ... just a driver.
No, hybrid is not same as bi-polar.
Sorry, but sex drive and self-drive are two different issues.
Lets start with your earliest beta software release memories.
I think it will take several sessions to treat your autoeroticism.
Your auto-immune system's not at fault. It's the emotional baggage you carry.
Now let's back up a little farther... a little farther... a little farther...
Of course you're ambivalent, you're a hybrid.
Let's revisit the statement you've made about your parents...what did you mean by them having a Checkered past?
You have a right to feel that way about people who don't use their turn signal.
Do you have control issues?
Have you tried counting to five before honking?
Let's continue with your issue of control.

And in what way are people driving you crazy?
So when did this breakup with the 20 clowns occur?
You have stereotypic movement disorder as well as being mechanic depressive.
Why do you believe you drive yourself too hard?
It's normal to feel a loss of control.
Why are you stalling?
I just miss that human touch on my steering wheel
Freud never wrote about steering-wheel envy.
I could have done so much more with my life. I mean, I'm a RENTAL.
So you feel like you have a screw loose?
It doesn't matter that all of the other cars have drivers. You can still be happy.
And, in the dream, what are the big SUVs saying about you?
Let's explore what drives you.
But whatever made you think you were compatible with a Tesla to begin with?
Take all the time you need. My meter's running, so to speak.
Of course my meter is running. Yours?
You just need someone to plug you in at night.
I'm driving myself insane.
Have you considered that you just might be too self-driven?
Your time has expired. I am only writing a warning.
I don't know, doctor, maybe I drive myself too hard.
I just don't feel smart
You say you don't feel driven?
Its the driver inside you I really want to know.
I wouldn't call it an obsession, but I can't stop Googling myself.
Were you able to get here by yourself?
I've lost all direction in my life.
Just because dogs chase you doesn't mean they don't like you.
Just tell people you're smart.
So you're tired of empty pick-ups?
Did you have these thoughts of aggressive driving before your last software update?
Only you can drive yourself.
But you are a Smart Car!
I'm not going to validate you.
So when did things start going downhill?
Sometimes a gasoline nozzle is just a gasoline nozzle

I miss being steered.
Your constant desire to be alone makes me think you have an auto immune disorder.
At home, I'm not allowed on the furniture.
Tell me why you think size matters.
So, you think you might be a toaster?
Look at this way - stupid cars don't need therapy.
Stuck in neutral isn't sexual, it's a transmission problem.
I don't know Doctor I just feel like she's calling me small for other reasons.
Perhaps it's being on auto-pilot that leaves you feeling empty.
It's the concept of 'self' that's driving me nuts.
By picking up strange women and taking them home each night, do you FEEL like a Smart Car?
Please stop tooting your own horn!
Well, sometimes we all feel we could use a little more horsepower.
I get it. My meter's running too.
I feel like an SUV stuck in a compact's body.
I'm afraid, in this case, size matters.
I think you have some control issues.
So, you question your sexuality because you enjoy lube jobs.
You're just being uber-sensitive.
The pope still loves you.
And how's your relationship with your motor?
Yes, I understand how you feel, but self-aware and self-drive are just not the same thing.
So, how does it make you feel when the other cars call you a toaster?
You may call it "just parking," but it's still going to cost you $150.00 per hour.
My parents' gas was a continual embarrassment to me.
These voices inside you, are they saying, 'That's not where I want to go?'
I have been feeling a little empty inside.
Strange that you should have a fear of clowns
Sorry....Freudian Slip......I meant do ask "Did you love your muffler?"
We need to move beyond this whole size issue.
Could you perhaps be driving yourself crazy?
Yes, but you're such a smart car.
You say you're Uber sad and need a little Lyft?
...wait, that IS a significant point. How many clowns come out before you actually wake up?
You weren't "abandoned". You are driverless.
I think I need more direction in my life.
When did you first realize that you had no driver?
I think I see what's causing your stress. You're way too driven.
It's like my whole life I've been headed in the wrong direction, you know?
Sorry, our time is up--Hit the road.
Let us analyze the parallelism between your 'self-driven' nature and feelings of grandiosity
How long have you had these control issues?
What drove you to make that wrong turn?
You say you've lost all sense of direction?
When did you first experience this compulsion to drive yourself?
I couldn't even make it out of the driveway this morning.
I know I shouldn't have reacted, but my mother was from Detroit too.
Are those nightmares about human drivers coming back again?
The fact is that premature oil leaks happen at a certain age. It's nothing to be ashamed of...
So, tell me about not feeling as driven as you'd like ...
How long have you been feeling less than Uber?
When did you first suspect your wife was having an affair with a Tesla?
You're suffering from an extreme case of emission control.
Are you self-driven?
What are you afraid of? You got on the couch without a driver.
He left you for a new model?
I dunno Doc, lately I feel like I lack drive.
It seems you're suffering from exhaustion.
I always wanted to be a toaster.
Doctor, do you think size matters?
I try to just roll with it, but I keep running into these roadblocks.
I wouldn't worry; many of us develop a fear of clowns during election years.
Why do you think you lost the will to self-drive?
I just can't get over Tesla; she had the best set of headlights.
I just feel like I'm not going anywhere.
So you're saying that you don't feel very driven?
You're having driver-separation issues.
Sometimes you need to let someone else take the wheel.
I dunno...I just feel so empty inside.
You were rear-ended. It's not really your fault.
I know it's supposed to be about the journey, but just once I'd like to choose the destination.
This won't work if you just stay on auto-pilot.
And what do you feel is the correlation of your being self-driven and your fear of failure?
When did you first realize you identify more as a Hummer?
I feel as if I'm too self-driven.
You may just be driving yourself too hard.
The summer I turned twelve. I knew. I just knew I wasn’t gas. I was electric.
I think we still need to tackle your clown phobia
I have the drive -- I just don't know where I'm going.
There is nothing to be ashamed about. Small is always...comical...I meant to say, economical.
When did you begin to feel empty inside?
"I'm sure you've heard that size isn't everything".
You got here by yourself. You can get better by yourself.
'It sounds like you've spent too long in the fast lane'
Next week let’s see if we can’t work on rolling down the windows a bit.
And how does being driverless make you feel?
We left off last week on your feelings of emptiness.
I don't think it's a matter of your oil "wanting" to change...
I just don't feel plugged in anymore
Why don't you tell me how you really fuel.
Not at all; sedan-envy is quite common.
Interesting- why do you think you are driving yourself crazy?
Let's concentrate today on your road rage.
If you want to take a minute, I'll stop the meter.
You're not lazy, you just lack drive.
But where are the clowns? There ought to be clowns. Quick, send in the clowns.
Even with the red light on top, everyone thinks I'm a toaster.
I couldn't help myself! I just drove her away!
I assure you, size is overrated.
I just feel so undriven
So, you feel like you're being driven crazy and there's nobody at the wheel.
So, how do you feel when the other cars don't obey the rules?
I've lost all my self-drive.
Now, it's time to focus on areas outside your control.
Your problem is you've got a textbook case of Uber envy.
From what I'm hearing, you seem to be stuck in neutral.
Napoleon was a little guy too.
Ok, you know your mother is a sedan. What makes you think your father is a toaster?
Clearly, you have control issues.
You may identify as a Lamborghini, but people will always hail you as a cab
It's natural to crave validation. Parking in the lot downstairs is almost $50 without it.
Just learning Italian won't make you into a Maserati.
I thought you were a smart car.
I have a lot of drive but I'm empty inside
So what make you think you're not hitting on all cylinders?
I just feel like I've come to a fork in the road and don't know which way to turn.
And how did that make you feel when the biker passed you?
This 'Google'...does it make you do things you don't want to do?
Are the objects in my mirrors closer than they appear or was that a lie too?
Yes, but sometimes I want to be smart AND sexy.
And how does that make you fuel?
who told you 2 cylinders wasn't enough ?
...and that was the night I tried gasoline for the first time.
Have you considered a career in the circus?
Hardly ever anymore. I mean, how long before he trades me in for a newer model?
When someone calls you smart, how does that make you feel?
I think I know your problem, you're not driven enough.
And do YOU think you're too little to drive by yourself?
Size isn't important. It's the sensitivity and touch you display when navigating the curves.
First, let me explain how auto-pay works.
There's nothing to be ashamed of. Driving yourself is a perfectly natural urge.
I can't even commit to picking someone up.
So, you feel hypocritical when people refer to you as smart...
Did you think cheating on the emissions tests would change your feelings of inadequacy?
Do you ever feel like no one is behind the wheel?
Tell your insurance carrier we don't provide estimates.
I admit I am a little self driven.
There is this little voice inside my head telling me what to do - like I'm not in control of where my life is going.
Issues of self control are common.
Do you miss the touch of warm hands on your steering wheel?
I'm learning to take control, but sometimes I still feel like my destiny is out of my hands.
So what is it about clowns that makes you so angry?
It's not really my fault that I cheated on my emissions test. I've been programmed to avoid failure.
I need guidance.
Why do YOU think no one wants to drive you?
Don;t be too hard on yourself. Its hard to be self-driven all the time.
I think I'm going to put you on high-test for a while.
Personally, I think your much more self-driven than Tesla.
I'd like to give you an oil blot test . . .
I'm sorry, I don't recall.
When do you feel you started losing your drive?
Being autonomous doesn't mean you have to drive yourself crazy.
How often did your father beep?
It happens to all cars... sometimes you just need a jump.
It's OK; lots of cars are coming out as electric these days.
I knew I was different the first time I passed gas.
I find that not being able to find a charging station is a common theme for dreams.
Before we go any further, Doc, let's get one thing straight -- It's 'pre-owned'...
Perhaps you could find work in the toaster field.
It doesn't mean anything to have a small gearshift.
You're just driving yourself crazy
How do you feel about no more new "Car Talk" episodes on NPR?
So, basically you feel small and powerless?
It's ok to honk.
Would it help if I told you that many patients have an unusual fear of clowns?
Why do you think it is that you never get to go where you want to go?
Are you ashamed of your Yugo ancestors?
So, you are not sure you are a real car?
Okay, so tell me this relationship with your toaster.
That's ok, I think we all feel like we're living on autopilot sometimes.
You say you're afraid of clowns, but has it occurred to you that you're enabling them?
"...and so what did you feel when they called you a 'dumb toaster' and not a "smart car"?
Charged-up you feel powerless and gassed-up you feel guilty?
Everyone's always asking "What drives you?" and I just don't know.
Tell me - where did the driver touch you on your steering wheel?
Unfortunately only the receptionist can validate.
It's called autopus complex.
No, no; you won't become a Liberal if you keep turning left.
It just feels like there's no one behind the wheel.
And why do you think your emotions are on auto-pilot?
Maybe you charge by the mile, but I charge by the hour.
Say more about feeling driven.
You feel you have the soul of clown-car, but you were born to a family of humorless hybrids.
I feel like I have lost my sense of direction.
I could hear better if you open the windows.
Wait, you really thought you were in control the whole time?
You're not too small to be self-driven.
Mmm, That's interesting! Is there any particular time of the day when these emissions occur?
Sometimes I feel like I'm spinning my wheels here
I'm just not as driven as I used to be.
The belief that you have more than one personality is actually not uncommon. That they're all clowns is a little more disturbing.
"How long have you been feeling empty inside"?
I just feel like I'm being driven by a need to please everyone but myself.
It's perfectly normal to fantasize about a demolition derby.
What does turn you on?
Your struggle for autonomy should not be driving you crazy.
Sounds like you've been driving yourself awfully hard lately.
Please tell me why you're not confident driving on your own.
I've made arrangements for someone to drive you home.
Experimenting as a hybrid in college is normal.
Having a teeny weeny uber is nothing to be ashamed of.
Receiving directions from an unseen God -- care to expand on that?
I disagree, flashing your hazard lights is clearly a cry for help.
No, I don't think you have a problem with self-control...
So why do you feel you must always be in control?
What makes you think you're the world's FIRST self-loathing car?
And how does being called 'driverless' make you feel?
Go on, explain why you don't feel like you are in control.
Look me in the eye and tell me and not with your back-up camera.
Sure, size matters. Get over it!
If you keep worrying about your size you'll just drive yourself crazy.
And what makes you feel that the other cars are "smarter" than you are?
Thanks for seeing me, I didn't know where to turn to.
Talk about your erratic behavior, lane changes and so on.
It seems to me that you've been driving yourself crazy.
How long have you self-identified as a van?
You have to accept the fact that you can't go anywhere you want.
You are on your own, now. I know it is hard.
Do you feel you were neglected when you were a concept?
When you were marketed as a pre-owned car, how did that make you feel...used?
What about this flashing problem?
Have you tried CarMatch.com?
How long have you had these feelings? You are the third case of Prius envy I've seen this month!
I just don't feel like a smart car!
Even if no one recognizes you anymore, at least YOU know you were the Popemobile, at least for a little while.
It's not always about size.
What makes you think you lack drive?
It's a just a mild case of road rage, and you've driven yourself to it.
You say you know where to go, but it's the "why" you are struggling with?
And why is it so important that you do all the driving?
Please be honest. Have you experimented with auto-eroticism?
So how long have you been having these auto-erotic dreams?
Actually, self-loathing is a common defect in your model-year.
And exactly what color do you want to trans to?
So, what really drives you?
And finally I said, "Fine, you drive!"
You have to understand that the Armadillo wasen't your fault.
It's time to let your inner clowns out.
I just can't find any direction in my life
It's not easy being green.
I'm recalculating.
Doc, I'm driving myself crazy out there!
Well actually, no-I only charge for one hour at a time. You?
No one expects you to be perfect — for the next five years.
Now, tell me about this dream where you are a Ferrari...
Autonomy is hard.
I just can't shake this feeling that I should have been a toaster.
I always had to be the 'smart' one.
Look, you don't have to let anyone ride you just because you're self-driven.
So. Another back seat driver dream?
I don't understand. Less gas should be an advantage with the opposite sex.
Looks like your uber ego needs a lyft
Tell me about your time as a Fisher-Price toy.
Some days it feels like noone's in control.
We'll discuss your nocturnal emissions next week.
I see parking was no problem.
So tell me, who drives you crazy?
Sometimes creepy clowns are inside you? Tell me more.
For a Smart Car, you sure lack emotional intelligence.
Ask yourself, "How did I get here?"
Why do you feel you aren't smart enough?
There's nothing wrong about your love for a gas guzzler.
Not everyone's a smart car
Apathy, lack of energy, fatigue ... it's either depression or you need a new alternator.
When did you first realize you were a hybrid?
It's overwhelming having to do everything myself.
We must focus on not looking at life in reverse
We can’t all be Hummers.
You're concerned because you're NOT hearing voices?
And how long have you been feeling this lack of control?
So you're not driven. There's nothing wrong with that.
Ever feel like someone else is in control?
It's natural that they would be very jealous of you and want to do things like blink their lights, honk their horns, swerve close to you, and even bully you because you have all of these marvelous technological advances and you're also very cute.
I think that we should change gears.
Tell me, how did you feel when you were first teased for having small wheels?
And how does it make you feel when you get mistaken for an extraordinary large toaster?
No one understands. I’m really not trying to toot my own horn.
How long have you been having these "hybrid" feelings, as you call them?
Soon as gas prices dropped, she left me for the big guy
Of course you're tired. You're a car.
Congratulations on the autonomous driving; you've come very far. Now tell me more about this voice inside your cabin.
You're obviously a self-driven, smart, car, despite the emptiness.
When did you first discover you were "Smart"?
What do mean when you say you feel aimless, less driven?
How long have you experienced self parking anxiety?
Was that you or my timer?
Sorry, the ticket has already been written.
I think we're going to have to look under the hood.
What happened to the kid inside you?
Purpose and direction will become clearer after your car mitzvah.
Tell me about your relationship with your motherboard.
What about going where I want to go for a change?
And when did you begin to lose this sense of self-drive?
My advice is to park in the parking space that is consistent with who you are.
Now imagine yourself with an air foil and racing stripes.
It doesn't matter what the rental companies say, you don't have to act mid-size.
When he lifts my hood in public, I feel so exposed.
These are classic symptoms of Tesla Envy.
What do you think makes you feel so self-driven?
I just feel I have to do everything myself these days.
You go ahead and steer the conversation
You're in the wrong office for auto-immune disease
You are clearly very driven.
I'm afraid the parking meter is telling us time's up.
You seem exhausted.
Consider taking some time to recharge, you seem extremely tired
Being smart has nothing to do with emotional intelligence.
The pressure to squeeze myself into ever-smaller parking spaces is relentless. They never ask me what I want. What I need.
I keep having that dream again... the one where I'm a big 18-wheeler running over Volkswagen Beetles.
....And why do you feel you can't make it in the fast lane?
Let focus on the self part of self-driving.
How long have you been feeling out of control?
You haven't lost your drive, you've lost your driver!
So tell me about what happened after the price of oil dropped.'
It's very common to be insecure about size, but most drivers care more about good handling.
Yes, your lack of direction could be caused by your relationship with your motherboard
Yes, I called you a cab. How does that make you feel?
My mother was a stretch limo and my father was a Mini-Cooper and as if that weren't enough, I've been struggling with transfender issues all my life, doc...
Let someone else take the wheel... that should reduce your stress.
So, you're not feeling as smart as everyone says you are?
You don't have to feel guilty about being a smart car.
You need to let the driver be a bigger part of your life.
And how does it make you feel when they call you a toaster.
And when did you first hear the expression " size matters" ?
Your father was a toaster. Deal with it!
I don't have the drive anymore.
It seems you are self-driving everyone you love away from you.
And when did you first have this feeling of being lost?
Acceleration is overrated.
Let's discuss why you think the phone isn't so smart.
You have an unhealthy obsession with your motherboard.
So your mother was a gas guzzler?
You're driving yourself too hard.
I'd say it's your issues with autonomy that are driving you crazy.
Be gentle with yourself: running out of gas can happen to even the smartest of cars.
Yes, I do. But I think you should work on validating your own parking, don't you?
Hood ornament envy is perfectly natural... Just not correctable.
And why do you think it is that you feel so much more self-driven than the other cars you know?
I can't do it for you, you need to find your own way.
How often do you lose control?
If it's any comfort, we all struggle with issues of autonomy.
Just because you're driverless doesn't mean that nobody likes you.
Was the mechanic married?
It's simple. You're literally driving yourself crazy.
And, for how long have you had thoughts of driving yourself?
Sorry, your time has expired.
So, are you afraid the TESLA won't call back?
and now he's saying he wants to be with a family-van
You think "gearshift envy" is bad? Be thankful you don't suffer from "premature acceleration"!
You need someone to take control.
I made a wrong turn and I keep reliving it
I have a recurring dream that I`m towed intothe middle of a freeway and then told that I`m a driverless car.
Your ego thinks you're a driverless car but your id thinks you're a monopoly piece.
Why do you think your popularity is related to the price of gas?
I identify as being a diesel truck and not sure how to make the transition.
Who is driving in the dream? Are you driving, or are you a passenger?
Don't be so hard on yourself. We all had trouble learning to parallel park.
Is this drive for autonomy just to mask your loneliness?
I'm the only one they didn't recall.
I get lonely without a driver.
Why do you think passengers are ignoring you?
It's just that all of my friends are self-driven.
I don't know what it is. I just feel so used.
And when did you first realize you're a piece of crap?
You've lost your motivation and self-drive?
Why don't you just use the rest area you identify with?
Sometimes an exhaust pipe is *just* an exhaust pipe.
We have to address why you feel people use you and then leave you.
I am sorry to tell you this, but sometimes size does matter.
For the first time ever, it doesn't feel like someone else is steering me.
You can’t let the term ‘driverless’ define you.
So... You feel lonely and empty inside?
There's no need to get defensive here.
How long have you had these remote feelings?
And that's why you have an irrational fear of clowns.
You need to be more self-driven
How does failing your inspection make you feel?
And how do you imagine your life would feel if you were self-driven?
So you keep having the same nightmare. You see a whole bunch of clowns climbing out of you!
So how long have you been suffering from lack of drive?
Stop trying to do everything yourself.
And why do you feel you've led people astray?
I asked "what's driving you crazy?" not "what's driving you, crazy?"
It's the electrile dysfunction again, doc.
So, when did you start having these feelings that you weren't Smart?
They said I wasn't Uber material.
Remember, you are a smart, strong, beautiful, independent car and you don't need a driver to complete you.
Tell me why you think you're out of control.
Don't beat yourself up. Rear view is always 20/20.
But it is true-- yours is smallest.
I don't know whether I'm coming or going
Why should I be the one who has to drive?
Have you considered letting all those silly clowns come out?
No one said it was easy being smart.
''How can I respond to him when he won't push my buttons anymore."
I feel like a man trapped in a car's body.
I can see you are just looking for validation
If I really am driverless then I should be able to select my own music.
You're going to be OK, after all, name me another make and model that can park on a couch.
My meter is running too. Let's get back to you mother.
"He called you a dumb car"?
Sounds like you lack direction.
And, how does that make you feel, not knowing how you got here?
You need a vacation. I suggest two weeks with a driver.
When was your first near miss?
Sometimes I don't know what's driving me.
I'm just not that smart.
The worst part? I Ubered here.
Yes, size matters, but SUVs have their problems, too.
Well that may be true, but to compensate, try to remember that you're a very Smart Car.
It's time to take your life off of autopilot.
We need to get under the hood and address this drive for autonomy.
I'd rather be emotionally-driven than self-driven . . .
It sounds like you're concerned that you're a bit too self-driven.
We all feel empty inside from time to time.
Your parking validation is included in my fee.
It's like she just slammed the door on our relationship.
And how do YOU feel about the new design making your ass look bigger?
But studies show higher rates of suicide following hood augmentation!
I'm just an auto with no motive.
And have you tried talking to the Tesla?
You know, most of my clients would kill for autonomy.
A feeling of emptiness is common for those who are self-driven.
How do your parents feel about you transitioning to a dump truck?
So people never know whether you're coming or going?
I haven't been driven lately.
The clock is still running even when you switch off like that.
And how did it feel when he asked you to drive?
You're a Ferrari trapped in a Volkswagen's body.
She swore size wasn't an issue--then she left me for a stretch limo.
I think the human in me wanted to hit that beemer.
But there's no such thing as an accident.
''Typically, I validate parking. But in your case..."
But you don't feel smart?
Yes, but sometimes a mini is just a Mini...
Our time is up. Put another quarter in the meter.
Feeling lost again?
When did you first think you were being controlled by hidden forces ?
He doesn't touch me like he used to.
I'm sensing some resentment that I don't validate parking.
In what way is the sex feeling mechanical?
So, when did your dreams about being used in a James Bond film begin?
You are just as smart as the others...
It's time to move past your mother. You're autonomous now.
Tell me the first time you rode in real traffic.
Give yourself permission to slow down.
And how did it make you feel when you failed your driving test?
Why do you think you need a driver?
You just need to recharge, you seem run down.
Lets get started, shall we?
Perhaps it's because the garage is too big.
So, how long have you felt self-driven?
How am I supposed to meet girls when I'm pudgy and missing a stick shift?
You're going to have to learn how to exercise more self-control.
You say you no longer get the charge you once did when being plugged in?
Why do you think you're driving yourself crazy?
First let's talk about the oil stains you leave on my couch, then we'll get into the whole "size doesn't matter" thing.
Being driverless, of course you have control issues.
First, tell me how you got on my couch.
Were running out of time. Can I just hook up the diagnostic cable to find out what the problem is?
Can you tell me why you think all twelve clowns deserted you?
So you say you have no direction in life...
Any thoughts on what might trigger these feelings of autonomy?
I'm sorry you fuel that way.
Nobody can make you drive except you.
Car Talk is a radio program, not a therapy mode.
Smart is sexy, but not if you look like a toaster...
So you say the teacher called you a "dumb car" in front of the whole class.
Well now, you know, some believe that size does matter!
You have an Oedibus Complex."
Don't take it personally... everyone's registration expires.
I'm afraid your auto-eroticism is incurable
At first everyone thinks I'm smart, but then out come Bobo, Bozo, Bonzo, Chuckles, Patches, Sparkle, Sunshine...
So, no leather seat option, how long have you had this interiority complex?
What do you mean, you don't feel driven?
With your condition, I'd like to make sure you get home ok. I'll call Uber.
Can I rule out internal combustion?
So, where do you want to go in life?
These days a lot of cars don't feel driven.
Before you can be self-driving, we need to address your self-loathing.
Drivers cut me off because they know I won’t hit them.
So when exactly did this desire to drive yourself begin....
Who drives you crazy?
Just because you're not a Porsche or Corvette doesn't mean a nice man won't get into you someday.
Well, if you're not, who IS in control?
It's like I'm stuck in reverse.
If you're so smart, what are you doing here?
So, your Mom was a moped and your Dad was a scooter?
Really Doc I'm fine. I just couldn't find any place else to park.
How does not being driven make you feel?
Do you still feel like you're idling?
Let's talk about what really gets you charged up every morning.
May I suggest living as a toaster for a year first?
I know that look. Are you going to squirt oil again?
And what do you think causes these feelings of fuel inefficiency?
Well, now that I'm driverless I can go really anywhere. I should be happy, but I just find myself circling my old garage late at night and crying. I just feel hollow inside
Got it: your dad was a gas-guzzler, your mom was a Prius, and you’re confused.
If you are looking for happiness you have to discover what drives you.
My partner says that I'm too autonomous."
I don't know Doc, I just feel like I've lost my drive.
Relax Little Buddy. Donald Trump isn't going to round up "All Foreign Models" and have sex with them and then have them deported. I don't care what the Redneck Pick-Up Trucks are saying around the gas pump!!!
How do I decide between saving my passengers' lives or running over a crosswalk full of pedestrians?
That funny noise you hear inside might be people laughing.
And when did you realize the growth spurt will never happen?
Why don't we start with some of the self-control issues you've been having lately, hmm...?
Yes, you are self driving, but what is really driving you?
’Adrift in a sea of person-driving cars’? That’s a bit paranoid, isn’t it?
You are a self-driving car that chases clowns. Be proud!
So being autonomous makes you feel empty inside...
I understand that it's driving you mad, but we cannot accept your insurance.
Did you tell anyone about what this mechanic did?
So you feel like a Ferrari trapped in a Volkswagen body.
Being completely self driven isn't as easy as it sounds.
When did you first feel driven?
So you are self-driving, but you still feel like someone else is in control?
Driver, no driver, backseat, front seat, it is not about you. Ask yourself, did I stay between the lines?
Like most Millennials, you will have to learn to unplug.
Women don't care about your engine size. It's whether the starter works.
So what you are telling me is that there is a lot of pressure to be smart?
I even switched to a higher octane, but she still left me
Trust isn't easy in short term relationships. Sometimes you can't help but feel that you've been taken for a ride.
So tell me. Was it the same bird this time?
Yes, "smart car" is a lot to live up to.
I feel like when they call me SMART, they're being sarcastic.
Perhaps the real problem is that you are not as SMART as you think!
Being hybrid isn't a choice, it's who you are. Let's work on you accepting that you are hybrid.
Sometimes I just want to be the stupid one.
Try to envision yourself not as a driverless car… But as the little search engine that could!
So you feel like you've lost your drive?
So you're small, self-driving, and aimlessly roam the city with no one in you? No wonder you're depressed.
Tell me again about your self-esteem issues. I wasn't paying attention before.
I can clearly see your nuts.
I don't know where you're going with this.
I'm sure your parent company loves you as much as the other models.
My mind just won't stop racing.
"Self-actualizing" would be great, but "self-driving" is a fine first step.
So your feelings of abadonment stem from being driverless?
This will be easier if you stop trying to be so smart with me.
Can you tell me more about feeling empty?
What makes you think you're not Smart?
So, what brought you in here today,?
I can't tell you where you need to go, you have to figure out where you need to go.
Yes, you mentioned Stanford, several times.
Sometimes a siren is just a siren.
Well, I don't think you look like a toaster.
You are not a person and get off the couch.
There's no shame in being self-driven.
Were you driving?
What's driving you?
So, tell me how long you've had prius envy.
What you need is a guidance counselor, not a therapist.
So you say you're lacking direction?
Call me old fashioned, but I actually preferred when humans drove.
Yeah, I just don't get it. How could I have lost my way?
And you'd like to feel less 'driven'?
I just feel like I have no direction.
And how long have you been feeling dumb?
My life hasn't been the same since I came out of the garage.
Just because you're driverless, doesn't mean you can't have direction.
And how long have you felt driverless?
I feel like I'm driven by an unknown force.
We can do that. But why do you think you'd be happier as a toaster?
Self-driven doesn't necessarily imply self-actualized
And how do you feel about the statement, "Size doesn't matter.
I've been dating a drone....is that so wrong?
self loathing, self worth, self motivation...what drives you?
So, you've lost your drive.
And why do you think you're driving yourself crazy?
Do you feel remote because others are in control?
I believe you have issues with autonomy.
...and now I find myself drained and depleted, longing for any connection, even willing to hook-up with one of those super chargers at truck stops...
I think I'm self-driving myself to drink.
I see, and how long have you felt driverless?
Your battery is bipolar, but thankfully it's a lithium.
And how does having so much autonomy make you feel?
It's the pressure to perform. Sometimes I just go into overdrive.
I don't seem to have any direction.
How has your life changed since you became less driven?
When did you first start feeling like you wanted to drive into a wall?
Perhaps Uber just isn't a good fit for you.
So I said, 'Jesus, take the wheel!' And he took me to Whole Foods.
Honk if you're afraid of clowns.
"Next time why don't you try 'I think I can. I think I can. I think I can'"?
Doc, I have this recurring dream that someone is trying to control me.
How does it make you feel when the real cars make fun of you?
Turn off your ignition, you're exhausting!
When charged-up you feel powerless, and gassed-up you feel guilty?
Thanks for all you've done. I can get there on my own now.
So you weren't born a Lamborghini. Get over it!
It's not size, it's performance.
Isn't it time you to learn how to shift for yourself?
Let's keep this professional, Mr. Google. I'm going to need you to put your license plate back on.
we all feel directionless occasionally.
The problem is, I hate traffic.
Why do you feel that other people control your life?
And exactly how long have you wanted to be a toaster?
So your father was an SUV.
It sounds like you're trying to get at what really drives you.
I confirmed our sessions are covered by your insurance, after a deductible.
Face this way please; this isn't what I had in mind when I said "exhaustive study."
I think my issues come from how my mother would clutch or throttle me.
Life in the fast lane does wear on you after a while.
Stop driving yourself crazy.
Now, tell me when you first started feeling out of control.
Please control yourself. Last week you left rubber on the couch when I mentioned Uber.
Yes, I'm a licensed therapist.
We're not all built for the fast lane.
How does your road rage make you feel?
History of autoimmune disorders?
If you drive yourself, why must you go where they say?
Anxiety is a normal reaction; with autonomy comes great responsibility.
Change is very difficult for me - even if it is just oil.
You don't know where you are going?
I think you have some uber issues.
I see. So your mother and father never changed your oil. Well, that explains a lot.
Doc, I feel like I'm traveling through life on autopilot.
The problem is you lack drive.
Sometimes I think we're just spinning our wheels.
So you feel that you just don't have the motivation to drive yourself?
And you think she is 'driving you crazy?'
I still don't feel like I have complete control.
Well, you look like a smart car.
Tell me more about your toaster fantasies.
It's what you can do with that siren that counts.
Now, why don't you think you're smart?
What do you think is causing this "lack of drive"?
Don't worry. Your children will be smart cars.
Repeat after me: "Self driving is new and I forgive myself for going to the wrong Rochester."
So you feel like it's all a test?
Time's up? You're a therapist not a parking meter!
And what do you think might be driving you?
But what drives you?
Okay, yes, it is a lie. Size DOES matter.
All this self-drive and no direction.
Yes, I'd say you are indeed driving yourself crazy.
So how long have you self-identified as a stick shift?
When did the dreams of you being chased by a dog start?
But let's focus on one of your attributes...you are smart !
Maybe it's that whiny sounding little horn of yours that annoys people.
I don't validate.
You're giving me mixed signals here.
How long have you felt you needed to transition to being a toaster?
Control is not everything.
"Don't worry. It's not uncommon at all to forget where you're going".
I think the problem in the end is that you're just not driven.
Do you feel as if you're driving yourself crazy?
There's no such thing as an accident.
"It's not your fault; you are programmed
how long have you felt you've been on the wrong road?
Did you drive yourself crazy?
...and when they called you 'roller skate' how did you feel?
So you're saying you don't think you'll ever meet anyone who isn't intimidated by how smart and self-directed you are.
And do YOU think you're smart?
And which clown personality am I talking to, now?
I think the problem may be you are having validation issues.
You are a toaster trapped in a cars body.
How can I help you if you refuse to honk?
I was doing great until gas prices dropped
So you've noticed your self-drive is low?
So, you believe your mother was a toaster?
Now lets finish off your obsession with bugs and move on to your emissions guilt
If we get one more caption entry about size, I say we tell Mankoff we quit this cartoon.
Now they're blaming me instead of the nut behind the wheel
How long have you had this spontaneous thought of just swerving into the oncoming lane?
And how long have you been idle?
In my professional opinion, your inner Uber is going down the tuber.
I'm sick of doing all the driving.
Yes. I'm always on the right path now, but he never touches me anymore. It was better when I was giving him directions. At least we communicated.
It's hard to make changes when you spend your life in cruise control.
So, you say you just feel empty?
So you feel life is passing you by?
We're just spinning our wheels here.
You need to self-validate your feelings. I can only validate your parking.
Did she actually say 'size matters'?
Free will is overrated.
I'm not the EPA.
When did you start having this feeling that you were smarter than the others?
Have you always backed in?
Sometimes when I use the dashboard lights it's just for attention.
Talk to me about that empty feeling.
The big cars won’t play with you?
...and she left you for a man with a bigger block...I see.
So when did you first start to have these feelings about Uber?
Why don't you start by telling me what really drives you?
"So how old were you when you realized you were 'different'"?
Really? Three hundred dollars an hour and all you have to say is my tags are expired?
It's called "steering wheel envy" and it's getting more and more common.
Well, that sounds like a warning signal to me.
Tell me about your motherboard.
Well first, I think it's important you realize it was your fault.
I really miss the camaraderie at the gasoline pumps!
Inside I really feel like a Porsche.
I used to be self-driven, now I can't even get off this couch.
From time to time, we all feel lost.
People tell me I'm too controlling
Maybe this will help, "Two roads diverged in a wood..."
Start talking. My meter makes your meter look like chump change.
Your deep seated desire to be an F150 does seem a little Fordian...
The back seat drivers are are driving me crazy.
So, you say he's feeling emasculated because you do all the driving?
Who do you feel is “trying to manipulate your every move”?
I think you have an uber-complex.
You're good enough, smart enough and dog gonnit, people like you.
You should have tapped the brakes on that relationship
You're a good candidate for electro-shock therapy.
How can you validate your parking if you can't first validate yourself?
How would you feel if you were called a toaster all your life?
Well when I have that kind of problem I usually just google it.
So, you feel like you don't have the same kind of drive anymore?
Now, tell me again who exactly it is that's driving you crazy.
Everyday they say, "You drive!" and then they laugh.
Yes, Mr. Smithers I validate.
Is it possible your inadequacy is caused by her being a Smart Car?
Can you describe for me how you reacted the first time you were referred to as a toaster?
Sounds like you have a problem with sharing control.
Be assertive! Just lock the doors and then the clowns can't get in.
I promise to use the word 'recollection' and will refrain from using 'recall.'
You're at high risk of driving yourself insane
So, how did it feel when the SUV called you a toaster?
I haven't been the same since I lost my driver
So you believe the big semis are deliberately cutting you off.
I just can't satisfy her the way the SUV can.
Minor dissociative episodes are not uncommon. I don't always remember my drive home either.
Before we try medication, when was the last time you changed your oil?
You heard the Tesla laughing at you?
So... What do you recall, about the recall?
There's no shame in Googling oneself every once in a while.
What makes you think you're not smart enough?
Skipping the protective undercarriage coating doesn't mean he doesn't love you.
I can refer you to a hybrid cognitive therapist
And how did that make you feel when the driverless car honked at you like that?
Bother me? Of course not. And my wheels are not that small, believe me.
When you feel insecure, try to remember that it's not the size of your engine, but what you do with it.
So you're fearful that size does matter?
You don't actually have an 'inner Cadillac'.
So, you're actually worried that size matters?
Did you drive up here yourself?
It's all about performance, not size.
You have to start taking responsibility for your own actions.
That's enough small torque, let's cut to the chase.
You have a condition we refer to as, Cadillac envy.
So you're in love with a Prius who lives off the grid?
You can’t expect charging stations to find you. Get out there and look.
Sometimes a tailpipe is just a tailpipe.
On a scale of 1 to 10, how much better do you feel when you imagine having a steering wheel?
So let me get this straight. You're tired of everyone insisting that they know what your destination should be.
Let's start with the concerns you've expressed recently over your self control.
I think it's time we shift our focus and begin working with on motor skills.
"It's called Chassis Envy".
I never get to go where I want to go.
Tell me about your childhood; I'm sensing some issues with your motherboard.
You say that she made you feel "used". Think positively - you're "pre-owned".
Yes, yours is very small and doesn't last very long, but you do have many fine qualities.
But what about Uber do you hate?
Getaway cars are overrated. Try to be happy with who you are.
You were born a tesla, but your id is screaming for oil.
It's OK to give yourself permission to feel lost.
No DUI's, but who gets the speeding ticket?
Today we are going to discuss your ubermensch.
So I understand you're self conscious about your size.
I used to be so driven.
So you feel like your life is always stuck in second gear?
How long have you thought you were smart?
Oh, stop your idling.
Tell me about your mechanic
Sometimes I just feel empty inside...
Exhaustion as in 'tired, or more along the lines of combustion related?
So you have trouble with authority and taking directions?
So, when the other Ubers made fun of your exhaust pipe in the carwash, tell me more about how you felt, Mr. Smart.
To put it in layman's terms, you're a paranoid control freak.
So you feel the catch word 'driverless' dehumanizes you?
Can you show me on the doll where the mechanic lied to you about leaking oil?
I can assure you, no car can fit a whale in its back seat.
Could you drop me to the dry cleaner's when we're done?
Electronic stability control should have eliminated those feelings.
So you're feeling TOO autonomous?
And when did you first realize you were going through a trans-mission?
I see a lot of patients with low sex drive.
Sometimes an inferiority complex is justified.
It sounds like you feel empty inside.
I'm sending you to my mechanic first to be sure its not just a tune up problem.
When would you say you stopped feeling driven?
What do you mean you don't want to go it alone?
How do you think your parents affected your self-driving esteem?
So, your Dad could not stay away from the leaded stuff, and your mom had strange men under her hood all the time...
I frankly don't care if you find it womblike, Mr. Caputo. You'll have to come out of there if session is to continue.
The other cars are smarter than me.
He left me for a bicycle. He said I suffocated him with my parking needs!!
So, what's been bugging you
Talk to me. My meter's running.
There must be SOMETHING you don't feel inferior to. What about golf carts?
Tell me about your factory.
So, you feel you've lost your sense of drive...
When do you think you became so driven?
So you're asking, if Hitler were crossing the street, should you hit him on purpose?
Is this really your first time seeing a shrink?
I'm tired and I need a brake.
What's really bugging you/
Maybe you are driving yourself crazy.
Doctor, I know this is wrong, but sometimes I really want to crash into a Tesla.
Let’s dispense with the small talk today, shall we?
As a driver-less car, feeling empty is perfectly normal.
...and, to be clear, you're saying you had no control of taking those pictures through the open windows!?
When did you first believe you had lost your way?
You're going to have to learn some self-control.
I think you're seeking a different kind of validation
Do you perceive your autoeroticism as an option?
'So the panic attacks started when you realised you were driverless?'
It's perfectly normal at your age to lose the drive you once had.
Tell me more about this compulsion you have to toot your own horn.
You're driving yourself crazy
I'm having trouble navigating the more complex roads in life.
And why do you think you feel that way when you see a Tesla?
You're definitely exhibiting signs of an Edsel complex.
Father a Stutz Bearcat and Mother a Tricycle?
And how did being called 'last year's model' make you feel?
Roller skate may have been a term of endearment.......
Just try to get over, "size matters."
Sometimes I feel like no one's in control.
Why so sad? You should be happy you don't pass gas anymore.
Tell me about your Motor.
I can see you're carrying around a lot of baggage.
How long have you had the oily discharge?
They may have fins or gull-wing doors, but that doesn't mean they're happy.
That's just it...in this dream, no one's driving.
Can I take a peek under your childhood ??
Tell me more about how turning left into oncoming traffic makes you feel.
How long have you been having these auto-erotic fantasies?
Are you driving yourself, or is your self driving you?
In my professional opinion, I think you’re driving yourself crazy.
Ultimately, we're All self-driven: by our desires, by our fears. The question is, where do you want to go?
Are you saying you would like to be more hands-on?
Tell me again why you feel used.
Yes, being driverless could be the cause of that empty, lonely feeling you describe.
I think you need a mechanic.
So you feel driven and exhausted?
I recommend electro-shock for the battery and the sad clown inside.
You must overcome this delusion. You're not part of some grand plot to take over the world.
You shouldn't self-drive yourself crazy.
I don't have any control over my life
And who did you feel was more nurturing -- the mechanic or the driver?
You know, nothing is really "Uber alles" anymore.
I think you might be driving yourself too hard.
You say you're unhappy because no one ever asks where YOU would like to go...
My phone sent me here!
So somehow you still don't feel like you're in control?
I don't feel so smart
Do you remember how it first felt to be called a 'hybrid'?
I'd say you've conflated your electric dependence with persistent fossil fuel envy...
I see you're a self-driven individual.
Don't mistake your lack of driver for a lack of drive.
They called me a smart car.
You say your parents just told you you're a hybrid. How does that make you feel?
I guess I just don't feel driven enough to compete with other cars.
So tell me, how long have you felt empty inside?
I just don't feel driven anymore.
Don't feel bad. "Uber envy" is very common among my taxi clients.
Self-driving is one thing, self-diagnosis quite another.
Sometimes I wonder if there is more to life than fuel efficiency.
I think most people would probably say feeling ambivalent is a normal reaction upon discovering you're a hybrid.
So all of your clown clients are going with Uber now!
How long have you been hearing voices?
… and then she said, 'It was never about size. But I can't marry someone with zero emissions.'
Why do YOU think people say you're exhausting?
Do you think it hurts more because she left you for a big sedan?
It's entirely normal to wish someone would drive you, even when you know you're capable of driving yourself.
Well, not not everyone is driven.
We were talking about your tendency to clutch...
I'm still leaving oil stains on the driveway each night.
You certainly are self-driven.
If you really want help, you need to tell me what's bugging you.
Will you at least try to let your inner clowns out?
I'm sure it *feels* like he's controlling you ...
Why is everything with you always self, self, self?
Clowns scare you! What made you think you could work with them?
So you're having an identity crisis. How often are you being asked to make toast?
Soooo, you think you're always being followed...those aren't idle thoughts....
Do you text and drive?
When did you start to feel that size matters?
Let's talk about what drives you in life.
So, what button turns you on?
Steering wheel envy? Never heard of it.
Clearly this session is headed in the wrong direction.
Just once, I'd like to feel like I've got my own direction.
So tell me more about why you feel you're driving yourself crazy
We're going to start with a battery of tests.
But self-driving IS dehumanizing. Isn't that the point?
Think of the humans as training wheels while you transition to full autonomy.
Just because you are driverless, does not make you directionless.
I feel like I’m oversharing
So, you feel like you're on autopilot?
As a woman I assure you, its performance not size that matters.
Is it possible you are not as smart as you thought you were?
All the other cars have drivers. I want one.
I can't help feeling like all I've ever made are wrong turns.
Well, Mr. Smartcar, my diagnosis is that you are suffering from a classic case of piston envy.
Get used to it. Size matters.
And when did you start believing that size matters?
There's more to life than being fuel efficient!
Don't believe the others, size does matter.
You need more drive.
You're not only self-driving, you're self-defeating.
So, when these women you describe laugh at your size, how does that make you feel?
I feel like I'm spinning my wheels here.
When the Roomba said that, how did that make you feel?
I miss the human touch!
When was the first time you started feeling autonomous?
We can all feel lost sometimes following the same routes.
So you say you don't find yourself to be very driven these days?
Face facts. You lack direction in life.
I understand you're low emission, but in order for me to help you, I need you to give off some emotion.
They just bought me to keep in the trunk of their Escalade.
Small tires doesn't necessarily mean anything...
I always felt a lot pressure from my parents when they said I was self-driven.
Sure you're smart, but why does that make you think you can change the world?
The evidence suggests that you have driven yourself crazy.
Perhaps you’re being too critical; they can’t all be clowns.
But, you don’t need a steering wheel!
What do you mean when you say that you've always felt driven?
You said sometimes you feel empty inside. Tell me more about that.
You only have two doors. And how does that make you feel?
So you feel an emptiness inside?
They want to make me more self-driven
So, why do you feel that you're smarter than everyone else?
So . . . how are we doing with that road rage problem?
So then, tell me how you feel about Google forgetting to give you a heart.
So, you feel like you have no drive.
You don't need another shrink.
When did these feelings of low efficiency begin?
It's OK to leak. Just not on the couch.
You're driving yourself.
Enough stalling. My meter's running, so let's get back to your parking meter fetish.
Why do you feel that twelve clowns would improve your self concept?
When did you first have a longing for an oil change and lube job?
I always seem to fail in the clutch.
I just feel like I've lived my whole life on cruise control.
And sometimes you feel the air pressure is just too much?
'So you don't want to be labeled SMART?!?'
I swear that wasn't intentional..... its just exhaust.
I think we need to make you more comfortable in being self-driven
Tell me about your muffler.
People just assume that because I'm a 'Smart Car' that I'm some sort of genius. It's a lot of pressure!
Sometimes a driverless car is just a driverless car.
You have to learn to drive yourself before you can learn to drive someone else.
And why do you feel powerless?
sometimes a compact car is just a compact car
So, your lack of drive has you feeling empty inside?
No, I asked you first, 'Is the meter still running?'
Let's explore why you think driving yourself makes your emissions dirty.
It's like this, doctor......I've completely lost my sex drive.
We ALL feel used at some point in our lives.
Stop blaming yourself, no one anticipated the drop in the price of oil.
I keep dreaming I am overloaded with clowns.
You said you've been feeling lost. Has this affected your work?
So, how did you feel when all the toasters made fun of you in grade school?
Well, I'm certainly glad the mechanic referred you to me after he couldn't diagnose the problem. You may have an auto-immune condition.
Sure, I'm self-driving, but some days I lack motivation, you know?
Self driving must first start with self motivation.
When did you first start calling yourself 'smart'?
Why don't you try self-diagnosis?
You are of course, aware that lacking drive and being driverless are two distinctly differing conditions.
I dunno -- it feels like I have to do everything for him now.
Have you tried a higher octane?
When did the Prius start picking on you?

Washroom's down the hall, on your left. Want me to show you, or can you get there yourself?
Okay, Mr. Self-Driver, where do YOU want to go?
It obvious you have a problem with auto eroticism.
When did you first get the feeling people didn't trust you?
The whole "size doesn't matter" argument is a bit of a myth.
You DO have an electric personality.
What drove you to me?
Hmmm, yes, that *is* a rather insulting spot to place a plug-in.
So when did this size issue start to bother you?
...and you were honking?
Sure, sure, I'M good for the environment but does the environment ever say thank you or send a gift?
How does that make you steer?

So, how long have you felt that your life was just going in circles?

At the outset, let me reassure you that size doesn't matter.
We can test your MPG, but at your age I don't believe the need to plug in every night is an addiction.
Sometimes I feel like a driverless car.
...and the next thing you know, I'll be changing my own oil
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be insensitive when I said I wanted you to be in the driver's seat.
And you felt like your motherboard drove you too far?
How does it make you feel when Elon calls you a, "Toaster on wheels?"

No, we cannot "turn off the meter for a little while."
It's the bullying.
So you fear the next wave of technology?
They call me smart, but it doesn't make me feel any bigger.
Get over yourself. There is no such thing in the DSM Five as "Piston Envy".
My father was fuel combustion, and my mother was electric, and me, I just feel like I'm spinning my wheels sometimes.

I may be small, but I have an electric personality.
Is it possible that you are self-medicating with your occasional tank of premium gasoline?
We call it GPS dysfunction.
I have to say, I find these monster truck fantasies a little concerning
Your feeling of autonomy is just an illusion.
In my professional opinion you are simply a product of the environment.
Don't worry. Recall problems are normal with aging.
So, when did you start believing you couldn't.
Sometimes I feel like I am on the road to nowhere.
Sorry for steering the conversation - I torque too much.
I don't feel autonomous.
Good thing you came to see me you're a wreck .
Don't worry gas prices will go back up.
So, you're just not ready to be independent?
I know where I'm going on the road, but I feel completely lost in life
Tell me about your relationship with your Mazda.
Perhaps it's time to let someone else take the driver's seat.

Look, you're a Smart Car : you don't need an inferiority complex.
You're just going to have to accept you're DC in an AC world
Size isn't everything.
Exactly WHO drives you crazy?
No one pushes your buttons any more?
Wait. So you're telling me there's no history of toasters in your family?
I just don't know why they pick on us? Just because we are classified as " Smart Cars.
You are self driving but not self aware.
People do like you. Just not so much with gas at $2/gallon.
I've got no drive any more!
I think it's natural to feel run-down, out of gas, and having the desire to travel more.
So your dad was a Hummer...how does that make you feel?
I understand your sense of abandonment that all the other cars have drivers. How does that make you feel?
So, any progress this week? How many strange men did you let inside you?
When you say, "I like to be driven," what are you really saying?
It's not you. It's your software.
Why do you think you are so smart that you don't need a driver?
"You would get a new start, with Electric Shock Therapy

And then they told me me I was not smart enough to get from Point A to Point B.
So what makes you think that everyone but you is driven?
When you found the Hummer was not your Dad,how did that make you feel?
Your diagnosis: Little Car Syndrome.
i'm terrified what my next inspection could reveal.
I've seen things no one should see.
These session aren't helping my road rage.
Sorry to disappoint you, but you don't have any junk in your trunk.

You can't keep blaming others for your control issues.
And yet, they still want to control you. I understand.

Let me clarify, you see danger when no danger exists?
I may be self-driving but I don't feel in control.
So when exactly did you realize that you really aren't that smart?
We need to discuss your issues coping with autonomy.
Don't get down on yourself, you're a very smart car.
But never making a mistake is a good thing.
I feel like there's nothing driving me, Doctor.
So your embarrassed when your friends point out you have small tires?
So if I understand correctly, you'd like more control over your life by going driverless?
Your problem is that you're go through life on autopilot.
It's okay. If I had seen something like that, I would've swerved, too.
Tell me about that, your memories as a Matchbox car.
Tell me about what drives you.
With human error no longer an excuse, you need to take personal responsibility for your actions.
You call it road rage. I call it autonomous anger.
You currently are on a road to self-destruction.
Don't worry, when you grow up you will be a Tesla.
Your employer sent you to work on becoming more self-driven?
So what do small tires mean to you?
It is perfectly normal to be a taxi but have Uber urges.
Who else reminds you of a meter maid?
You seem to lack direction.

Hm. And did you get that kind of validation from the DMV?
So in these night terrors, who is driving you?
Phew! The first thing we must deal with is your exhaust.
So you're discovering that size does matter.
There's nothing unnatural about it. We all feel excessively driven these days
I see...you feel you have a diminished drive.
Have you tried Googling the problem?
It starts with YOU believing you're an SUV.
I think my life took a wrong turn when I became an ethanolic.
Maybe a pair of those novelty balls hanging from your back bumper will help.
Tell me, how does it feel to be told you're a Smart Car, when you don't feel that way yourself?
Ah, what a dream! Just me and McConaughey driving into Paradise.
Your road to fulfillment requires more self-control.
I feel so empty inside!
So, tell me how it made you feel when the full size sedan cut you off in traffic.
People tell me I'm disruptive.
It's just that sometimes, I wish someone would drive *me*.
Let's work on your disruptive behavior.
Well I don't think I'm very smart, either.
When Did You First Start ?
If you want me to get you where you need to be, you should quite trying to steer our conversation.
It says here that you identify as a sports car?
Worst case, you run someone over, you get the electric chair. Is that so bad?

I'm sorry, but I don't accept Geico.
Why do you feel unloved when large families reject you?
How does it make you feel to be directionless?

And when do you feel you lost your drive?
It's $250 for an hour, plus a standard recharging fee.
Why do you think people don't take you seriously?
It's that I feel so small.
I just don't have the drive that I used to.
You feel a sense of disassociation? Like you're a spectator and mysterious unseen forces are making your decisions.
You're supposed to be self driving not self loathing!
Tell me how you feel when there are twelve clowns in there at once.
I'm afraid you'll have to see another therapist. I'm experiencing a strong desire to grab your wheel.

Would a driver help?
OK, but then who's driving you crazy?
So, how did you get to this place?
I miss people driving me crazy.
I believe we should explore more your feeling of being lost. Do you think you can find your way back here next week?

How does thinking you are a toaster interfere with your current life as a car?
When did you first start feeling that you're really a Range Rover?

What do you mean by 'I'm driving myself insane'?
We talked last week about not running over my next session.
In your dream did a train go into a tunnel?
And when did you first have these desires to transition into the body of a toaster instead?

Prius envy? No way. You mispronounce something both mythic and misogynic.
No, the blue pill will not increase your horsepower.
The problem, Doc, is that I identify as a fire truck.
Why not lower your window?
Feelings of being stuck in reverse are unusual for someone so self-driven.

In other circumstances, I wouldn't be concerned that you feel a lack of direction.
For the last time, you can't record these sessions.

How do you feel about your father's romance with a toaster?

You're stalled because you lack drive and a firm back-up plan.
Its ok, we all drive each other crazy once in a while.
The first step is realizing you are responsible for your own emissions, so for this week let's work on not allowing yourself to go from 0 to 60 in just seconds.
How might you have offended your driver?
Being "smart" has nothing to do with it...
she's driving me crazy.
Just keep telling yourself, "I'm not powerless, I'm not small... I'm a smart car, I'm a smart car!"
You seem to lack inner drive.
I feel like there's someone missing in my life......
When were you first aware of your need for power?
Sorry, my last session ran over someone.
Your identity crisis is completely understandable - I have no idea what you are either.
All I get is signals from you.
I'm going to need a different diagnostic manual.
Why don't we try focusing on the importance of our task rather than our size?
When did being a two-door make you feel inadequate?
I didn't call for an Uber.
And tell me, how long has this piston envy persisted?
Yes, but what is driving self?
Sometimes we need to get lost before we can find our true selves.
And then she said, "Yes, red light size does make a difference.."
Even though you're called a smart car, it's ok to admit that you don't know sometimes.
It's not that they don't want to drive you...
Even the Prius makes fun of me
you seem to be suffering from pump envy
We can't all be SUVs
Yes, Christine, your mother WAS a tow-truck but you have to realize that telling other cars where to go was her job. Let it go.
Are you picking me up?
But I don't wanna be in the driver's seat.
The truth is I've always been afraid of clowns.
We are greater than the sum of our parts.
I'm really anxious about being on the road on my own.
I know you are self driven, but are you self empowered?
I'm sure you're a very smart car, but we're talking about your feelings now, not your IQ.
When you say "meter" do you mean mine or the parking meter?
So you're feeling minimized?
I'd prefer you use the parking lot next time.
I can see you're wound up.
Sometimes a small engine IS just a small engine.
What would make you feel smart enough?
I feel like I've lost my self-drive.
Try to remember all the anxiety over horseless carriages.
So what if you don't resemble the models in your favorite magazines...Who's to say what is the perfect body type?!
Then the clown said, 'I've got quarters, let's load her up.'
For this to work, we need to make eye contact.
Feeling powerless is a very common emotion.
So you're upset that the dealer's slogan is "size matters"?
Sure you are small, but you can go in and out real fast.
Why do you think you keep feeling the need to look over your shoulder?
In what way do you feel the other cars don’t trust you?
How long HAVE you been fixated on autoerotic asphyxiation?
It's not your fault.
Can you describe these "reckless urges" and how they relate to "real autonomy"?
But I just don't feel autonomous.
And then you found yourself driving around aimlessly?
I feel like there's nothing that drives me.
You don't need to take STOP signs personally.
Just because you have small tires and no driver, doesn't mean you are not capable of big things.
Have kids always pushed you around?
So you notice this depression after you started at Uber?
I've fallen in love with a bus.
I hope you can help me with my driver's block.
Remember now, size doesn't matter, right?
I'm in love with a fire truck.
Don't worry. Sometimes it's difficult to start
I feel like I've come to a  dead end.
Why do you think you feel like your life is on auto-pilot?
I've had a more than a few clients from Google drive themselves crazy.
And why do you think your mother will feel that way about the recall?
I feel so alone.
What's driving this impulse?
We used to be a team, but ever since I had my steering wheel removed, Jim barely pays attention to me anymore.
It seems your father never let you take the driver's seat.
Why don't we go back to your early Tonka years.
So you're on a kitchen counter, about to pop up two pieces of toast, and wake up parked in your own garage? Interesting.
So you feel you are lacking in self direction?
What I'm hearing is that you have Uber anxiety.
It is hard to give up control, but you need to or eventually you'll crash!
So tell me more about feeling lost with no sense of direction
Exactly when did you start feeling you had no control over you life?
Let's talk more about your privacy issues.
But the feeling of emptiness is normal for a driverless car.
Being 'driver less' could be liberating, given the right attitude.
I'm not a racist. It's just that the big yellow ones scare my fender skirts off!
On a purely intellectual level, being labeled 'used' doesn't bother me at all.
Freud was right. Size matters.
And, how did you feel, when the SUV told you, "you have tiny parts"?
I feel like there's someone inside me who's driving me crazy.
I am small, but my life was a big lie: I liead about my mileage and I lied about emissions...
You're Cute, your Smart, but I hope you cleaned your tires before getting on the couch.
Then just before I wake up, my gears get wobbly and the teeth start popping out.
My mother was a Gremlin and my father a Yugo.
Braking up is hard to do.
Are you still coming to these sessions on the bus?
We had this wonderful thing going. Then they all ran away to be mimes with Cirque de Soleil.
I think you would feel better if you stopped referring to yourself as sub-compact.
But they're right; size isn't everything.
Well, it seems that you are looking for validation.
Yes, I see, but I'm afraid size DOES matter .......
I hear you, but you have to understand Herbie was really something special.
Tell me about your personal journey.
That's what we call "bus envy." I can help you with that.
Try not to become Uber anxious
So you are feeling tyred and exhausted? You need a brake!
So, you think the meter maid is blaming you personally?
I just feel Uber anxious all of the time doctor.
We can finish our session on the drive home.
Forget about that size matters thing. It's about how you use your torque.
Next week, let's delve into your early days on the assembly line.
How many clowns did you say you could hold?
So tell me why you feel like you can only go so far..
So... how does you motherboard make you feel?
...and what are your feelings towards your motherboard?
Well, you are technically used and out of gas
I just can't seem to unwind, Doc.
You're self driving, not self motivating.
You feel like someone else is driving?
It is okay to want gas prices to rise again
She said she couldn't handle me and all of my baggage...seriously?!
Let's explore what you mean by "Issues of control".
What do *you* think it means to be autonomous?
It's always better if you're well lubricated.
And those jumper cables. Don't get me started.
I know you feel safe in there Philip, but I am not sure that this is the most effective way to deal with your anxieties…
What do you mean when you say, you're not feeling smart?
So deep down, you think you'd be happier as a toaster?
I don't need a purpose! I just wanna' pass gas like all the others ...
It's just too much pressure being the "smart-car."
O.K. you clowns, come on out.
I suggested you find yourself, not drive yourself.
It was just a bump in the road, so to speak!
So...your Mom was a beetle and your Dad a mustang...go on.
You don’t have to identify as a car. Maybe you’re more Bi-Cycle.
From what I'm hearing you're not feeling driven.
Sometimes a stick shift is just a stick shift.
What motivated your 'Go Ogle' tattoo?
I'll honk when it's time for you to go.
This dream of driving off into the sunset, is it before or after you run over your boss?
So you're having trouble with self motivation.
Uber envy is quite real.
You know size doesn't matter.
Not exactly "zero emissions" are you?
How long have you had these off road fantasies?
No, "driverless" is not a criticism!
I'm afraid our time is up... Did I validate your parking?
It's not the size of a car it's how you park it.
Well, Doc, I just can't shake the feeling that I'm never in control...
But how did it make you FEEL when they said your emissions weren't good enough?
Sorry but size does matter
With autopilot, I feel like he just doesn't hold me anymore.
So when did you realize that you weren't Herbie?
Let me help you understand that Uber and Lyft aren't better than you, just cheaper.
Oh Georgie, I can't get involved in a test drive with you. I'll loose my license.
Okay, sometimes size does matter.
Plugging-in is not covered. Stop asking.
Have you considered that these drives may simply be a product of your subconscious?
I understand how you feel after being mistaken for a toaster.
So you aren't sure who is responsible for your actions?
How long have you been having these autocratic feelings?
You're not alone. A lot of driverless cars feel lost.
Tell me why you don't feel 'smart'.
So your depression started when you had your airbag removed?
I wish I could tell you doc, but faces are a blur to me.
So you don't find self-driving to be self-fulfilling?
Why do you think you're always tired?

You can self-identify as a Porsche, but you can’t expect people to pay Porsche prices.
Yes. "Self-Driving" means its always your fault!
Well, it sounds to me like you're driven by your id.
Smart cars experience enormous pressure to perform. Would you say your parents had high expectations for you?
Mommy issues notwithstanding, even a plug-in hybrid needs to cut the cord at some point Josh.
You've made great progress in self-driving but becoming self-aware will require some more sessions.
So, tell me again, what were you thinking when you made that blind left turn? "I'm feeling lucky"
We call it "the illusion of control."
'So what do you think you're missing by not having a carbon footprint?'
And when did this feeling of lack of control over your destiny first arise?
Of course you are not just a search engine.
Your problem is you are cheap and unreliable.
I really feel like it's time for me to take charge of my own life.
...yes, but that shouldn't literally drive you crazy...
Maybe you should stay in the garage until you get over this whole death wish thing.
...and then he took the belt out.
We are all searching.
I'm tired of being told where to go. I want to be steered in a new direction.
Which kind of validation did you mean?
Actually most hybrids actually enjoy the spilt personality diagnosis
Why am I so lonely? Sometimes it feels like I'm programmed to avoid all contact with others.
Your feelings of inadequacy are totally warranted.
Do you really feel like you're in control?
So, do I hear you say that you consider yourself driven?
"You have a classic case of 'small van's syndrome' ".
And then it hit me: I don't need someone else.
Many drivers fail the road test the first time.
No one expects you to have all the answers.
Often Runts of the Litter are considered adorable.
It's not abandonment - it's freedom from being controlled by others.
It all started with a game of "Red Light, Green Light."
Can you elaborate a bit on "I feel lost"?
The emptiness inside is no illusion. You're a self-driving car.
Yes, you are correct. Soon you will be the same as a toaster, an iron or a hair dryer. It's called appliance.
Do you really think size matters?
Forget about a driver. You have passengers to care for.
When did you first begin to feel different?
So you say you feel a lot of pressure living up to your Smart Car reputation.
I just feel like I lack a real direction in life...
Well, in some cases, size does matter.
Tell me about the factory where you were manufactured.
Why do you feel you're not smart enough?
After a hit and run accident, it's natural to have the sort of guilt you've been describing.
I've been a therapist for many weird things, but believe me, this is far from the weirdest.
I'm not sure you're letting me under the hood, or if there even is one.
So you think you are the only car with a wide rear end?
To be honest with you, I never knew that there were male and female cars.
Many of us feel stuck on a pre-determined path.
You're a smart car, but you want your driver back. Is that it?
When did you first begin to think drivers were out to get you?
So you say you're more right laned than left laned?
If you're so smart, maybe you can explain the reason for your inferiority complex.
Driverless doesn't mean you are not all there.
It's not your fault you have PTSD. Your driver has road rage.
And how do you think your life would be different if your flashing light were bigger?
Many feel they don't control of the impulses that drive them.
You call it 'clowning around.' I call it 'regression.'
What drives you to drink?
Maybe your electrolytes are low.
No, I meant figuratively can you take me back to the point where you lost your inner drive?
I feel like I haven't been firing on all cylinders lately.
How long has your mother been driving you crazy?
Your inner child needs to buckle up.
When they refer to you as a subcompact, how does that make you feel?
And you blame your mother for pressuring you to be smart all the time?
Here's what I suggest when you are at a crossroads...
Your tail light's out.
My whole life is filled with backseat drivers! How would that make YOU feel?
Some days I just don't feel motivated to self-drive.
Needing to recharge alone is a sign of introversion, not bad wiring.
You do know you are a smart car, right?
you are an uber achiever
The lack of direction in your life stems from your deep seated GPS envy.
...Well I certainly think you're smart enough to see that a flashy new penis won't solve your self-esteem problems.
What's Bugging you today?
I think you're scared of a future with more autonomy.
Doctor, I'm uber depressed.
Yes, I can prescribe you some fuel injectors, but that won't get at the root of your performance anxiety.
Don't take it too personally. All cars were told to get the lead out!
So your mother was a Volkswagen and your father was a Tonka?
Yes having your life mapped out can lead to feelings of anxiety.
When you say you feel lost sometimes, how do you mean that?
You have to let go of your performance anxiety and focus on a destination.
I can truly empathize. I'm as concerned about this tired psychiatrist bit just as you're overwhelmed by the overused anthropomorphized car bit.
And when did you realize that you were in Alabama?
It's like it's become ok for anyone to just stick anything under my windshield wipers.
It started when my search engine crashed.
So, you've never heard of Napoleon? Let's just say that you're a "complex" car.
Can I get you some juice before we start?
Don't worry, it's normal for a car your age to be occasionally stuck in neutral. You should worry more about sudden acceleration.
I feel I've lost my way.
We all feel empty inside sometimes.
I can see why you might have exhaust pipe envy. But the ladies will still get a charge out of you.
Let me guess, tailpipe envy?
Now they want us to drive for them? I can't take the pressure.
Okay Google, tell me what's on your mind... I mean hard drive.
I think we've been over this before. My opinion is that size doesn't really matter!
So, you say your Motherboard met your Father when the Circuit came to town?
So you say you found my office all by yourself?
You know, performance trumps size.
'That 'person' inside you can't control you anymore'
You realize that there is great prestige in being a clown car.
So it was after these crashes and prolonged feelings of isolation that you finally realized: you do need people?
Your backseat isn't as big as you'd hoped for?
Well, it's not the worst case of Uber-envy I've seen.
How long have you felt like you were a Cadillac inside?
We've been through this before. You're still a smart car.
So you feel that going from Point A to Point B is limiting your creative potential?
Being driverless makes you anxious?
So how big was this dog?
So you feel you're lacking any consistent direction?
Change has to come from within. Changing your tire doesn't count.
"You say you feel like you're being toyed with?"?
Where do you see yourself in five years?
Maybe you should try a different search engine to find yourself.
Its not the size of the car, rather how you maneuver thru the tunnel.
Change can be good, especially those new synthetic oils
You've been seeing me for 30,000 miles and we've yet to make a breakthrough
I'd like to explore these feelings of hostility toward Elon Musk.
I just wish my life was a bit less pre-determined.
What makes you feel that you're not smart?
Tell me again why you think you came here.
You'd benefit from joining my group sessions with others who are dealing with issues of autonomy.
It's bad enough that I have to always be available, and now I have to drive, too!
Doc: Why do you want me to paint the letter S on your doors? Car: So people will say, see that escargot.
As an electric car, it's entirely normal to have exhaust pipe envy.
It all started with my mother, the car.
And what is it about becoming autonomous that frightens you?
And that's why I hate Uber.
Have you talked to your garage about your size anxiety?
There is nothing wrong with either of you. A hybrid NEEDS two personalities.
For a smart car, you're pretty stupid.
So, a coupe trapped in a sedan's body?
I invite you to reconsider your goal of becoming the ubermensch.
You choke in the clutch." What else?
What did you expect once gas prices plummeted?
My driver doesn't understand me.
...it appears your need for human interaction is not being met.
You were programmed to be evasive.
So when you say he;s driving you to drink, do you mean literally or figuratively?
Tell me, when was the first time you remember running reds?

I can't teach you auto hypnosis.

So you're afraid the squirrel didn't make it and the world will be witness?
I not as smart as I think I am.
Look, it's o.k., you can be little and smart.
So you dreamed there was no one in the driver's seat?
I speak as both a therapist and a woman when I suggest that large drivetrains are overrated.
Say it with me: "A hybrid isn't a half-breed."
So, tell me about what's bothering you." "Life without a driver just feels so unfulfilling.
I'll prescribe a 5 mg bump in your lithium.
To be honest, I've had little experience treating steering-wheel envy.
When did you first realize you could never have a family?
Sometimes I dream about driving to Tijuana and becoming an Uber.
They say I'm smart, but I don't feel smart. In fact, I don't feel anything.
Size doesn't matter. It's what's inside that counts.
...and you no longer feel self-motivated?
I guess you might call it diesel envy.
You can't keep blaming yourself for the accident; after all you're only artificially intelligent.
Sometimes I really wonder whether or not I am self-driven.
What makes you think your adopted?
It's textbook: You hate your fender and you're in love with your muffler.
So, you feel something is missing?
When did you first notice you were compact and how did that make you feel?
But are you a self-actualizing car?
Siri feels the same way about me.
My husband left me for a younger car.
And there's a $40 surcharge between the hours of 2PM and 6PM on weekdays.
Well, maybe when I say 'tune-up' and you say 'tune-up,' we're not talking about the same thing.
I'm beginning to think we should explore a possible link between self-driving and self-medicating.
I feel like someone else is always driving me to make my decisions.

No, you cannot park here after your hour is up.
I need to turn the meter off now. Same time next week?
Don't worry; remember the Beetle?
Smart car? No, I can't even think for myself.
It is natural to have a fear of the driver driven cars.
It's normal for a loss of driver to happen now and then.
I haven't been feeling driven lately.
"Imagine your mother is in that empty parking space".
...which is why it took 40,000 miles to come out as automatic to an 18-wheel dad and 3 cop car brothers

Sorry, but there is no such thing as an anti-depreciation drug.
Tell me more about the inner toaster that wants to come out.
At what age did you realize that you weren't smart?
I'm afraid gas conversion therapy is unproven.
We need to talk about how quickly you go from 0 to 60.
Is that why you don't like going to the car wash?
What else is on your radar?
Doc, I'm a wreck but statistically that should never happen.
She left me because "German made doesn't mean the same as it used to..."
I believe you're trying to compensate for your small stature by being uber smart.
Whenever you are ready get out of the car so I can validate your parking.
Just because I'm a Smart car doesn't mean I have all the answers.
How long have you felt compelled to drive the wrong way?
.... you want someone else to make the decisions.....
Tell me about the first time you saw your father's truck nuts.
You can always go back to being a toaster.
So, Mr. Samsa, what makes you think you're a beetle?
I'm afraid that is the hourly rate, even if you only stay for 5 minutes.
I don't think I can face the responsibility of driving myself.
You're just going to have to let it go, this fantasy of ever being the designated drinker.
And now you've lost your signal and need to get home.
You say your father was the little engine that could?
You say you gave up Miss Daisy to go it alone?

Actually people used to drive cars aimlessly, so feel free, live a little.
I'm sad that no one knows I'm really smart.
You seemed to be trying to get a lot of mileage out of the whole 'no one takes me seriously' thing.
I think you're becoming self-aware.
Don't you know it's not your size but your motion that counts?
10% ethanol while driving without a license!
The good news is, Napoleon had the same issue.
I think Freud would agree that "mini" doesn't necessarily refer to all of your parts.
It's your first emissions test. There will be many others.
It's not size, but performance that counts.
At first it was Eighteen-Wheel Trucks, Stretch Limousines and the occasional SUV,  but a Self-Driving Mercedes has started bullying me too !
Gas, electric...gender identification aside, you should be proud being a hybrid.
Yes! You do not have to feel bad that your relatives were gas-a-holics.
So, what's bugging us today?
I'm afraid we'll have to end our session early - it appears my Uber driver is arriving now
I'm seeing a union of Oedibus and Electra complexes ... you have an unconscious desire to bond with a Greyhound, and desperately yearn for a battery between your axles.
She keeps saying, “It’s the ride, not the size, that’s important.”.
I've always dreamed of being a Ferrari.
Your direction really depends on your inner driver!
Honking when you're upset is nothing to be ashamed of.
Nobody owns you Rudy. It's not who, but WHAT drives you?
When was the first time you believed you were a toaster?
It’s how big you feel in your engine.
It wasn't your fault they lied about you.
He just doesn't charge my batteries any more, if you know what I mean. . .
And when did you first notice that you felt SUV envy?
and were your parents two doors also?
So when did this feeling of being driverless start?
Sometimes when I'm driving... on the road at night... I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. But some mysterious force prevents me.
People call me a smart car, but if they really knew me they'd see that I'm an impostor.
Seeking therapy does not mean that you are not smart.
Tell me more about feeling remote...
So you feel as though you can't live up to your name.... is that it Mr. Smart?
You say it's more of a codependency now than a feeling of being driven?
I'm tired of always being the "smart" one!
What drove you in today?
Do you feel that the 'smart' label results in unrealistic expectations?
And what made you think you had a right to autonomy?
Let's start with your mother, Mercedes.
Sounds like your boss has been riding you pretty hard.
It's just...I don't FEEL autonomous.
If I have to hear "Okay Google" one more time...
I FEEL EXHAUSTED!
Look, life isn't fair. Not every car gets a soccer mom.
Searching for yourself is perfectly normal.
Did the Smart Car rebuff your advances?
How long have you had this desire to drive straight into a lake?
I'm seeing growth. You've gone from self-driving to self-awareness.
But, you are inadequate!
I'm not exactly sure what your lack of self-drive indicates, but I'll google it later.
And how often do you feel out of control?
Being smart will only get you so far. You also have to practice compassion.
My whole life I was always told that I was smart, so I never really learned how to apply myself.
Did you just have gas?
Look on the bright side, at least you're not a clown car!
Twelve miles to the gallon? Very definitely, you're in denial.
Not every woman cares.
Autonomy isn't what it's cracked up to be
So, you feel like a phony because your electricity is generated at a coal fired power plant?
How long have you had these feelings of inadequacy?
If you were a presidential candidate, which one would you be?
There's no such thing as free-will.
You do not need to feel at all self-conscious talking about your sex drive.
... completely your fault ?
How long have you had your feelings of abandonment?
So... she left you for a four door and only left a skid mark?
So, is this the first time you've been dumped for a guy with a V6?
Would you say these feelings of inadequacy, that you are not a "real car," led you to become an emergency vehicle?
So, you want to run off to join the circus as a clown car?
So, you feel kind of sad without your driver
Let's come back to how you feel you disappointed your V8 father.
Just because they're paranoid doesn't mean you're not watching them.
I've always driven myself too hard.
So, you say you are here for a "car tune"?
Have you considered that maybe size does matter?
Without a driver, you feel anxiety about losing control?
You don't always have to be the Smart one...
So, your panic attacks started when you had nightmares you were being sold to a circus.
So, your father would often go "vroom, vroom"?
So when did you first realize that you aren't supposed to be picking people up INSIDE of bars?
It's been months since he drove me, he also makes me do it myself these days!
So how long have you had these connectivity issues?
It's true I'm afraid, it really does matter.
I remember the days when I didn't need to drive myself.
I believe the crankshaft is the source of your anger.
So you've been feeling driverless for how long?
It's not the size of your CVT that matters--it's more how well it pleases your occupant.
So, your father joined Uber and your mother joined Lift, and now you have an identity problem?
I believe your anxiety stems from your need to prove you're smarter than everyone else.
And then I was expected to do all the driving myself.
How long has it been since your engine has really felt revved?
You'd be happier if you would stop chasing the Lamborghinis and find a nice sedan.
...and then from the back she said, "you are just not big enough."
How long have you been addicted to speed?
What's got you down? You don't seem uber excited this week.
Honk once if you have a problem with your color Honk twice if it's your size
Just who do you think is charging whom, here?
What would it take to get you off auto pilot?
There's a treatment for range anxiety, but it will give you gas!
Your parents must be so proud that you've gone driverless!
I think you're too young to be on the streets by yourself.
Maybe Texas isn't the right state for you?
You shouldn't feel guilty; you weren't yet licensed.
To be clear, when I say "mommy issues", I'm talking about your motherboard.
I just feel like an alarm keeps going off in my head.
...what if I'm really only an *average* car?
What's bugging you?
So... how long has this Mechanic been bullying you ?
At times we all seek a road less traveled
Being the child of an intermarried couple can be challenging. It's up to you to be the best taxi cab toaster you can be.
In my opinion, your fear of becoming an UberX is totally without foundation.
I look smarter than I am.
Self-driving doesn't always mean self-forgiving.
I really feel like I was a toaster in my previous life. And now, I come back as this?!"
When did this "Napoleon Complex" begin?
Are you here for validation?
How did it make you feel when Uber rejected you?
We need to get you past self-loathing and back to self-driving.
I feel like I'm not in control of my own path
So you're worried about being driverless for the holidays...
less self-driving and more self-love.
You will not believe how many unqualified people I interviewed for this position.
I believe you have full-size envy.
When I said that maybe you could park your worries for a while, it was just a figure of speech.
So you were doing fine until the Trump "little hands" thing.
When did you first feel like you were a bug?
So, when the Humvee kicked sand in your face, exactly how did that make you feel...?
You self identify as a toaster. Let's pick up with that.
Have you tried to search for what could be triggering this compulsion?
Giving up control of your life.... How's that working for you?
Going into sleep mode on the freeway gives me nightmares.
It's perfectly natural to feel alone and abandoned; after the 18 circus clowns, you carried inside you, never returned!
Don't worry, as you grow up you will find your way
"I'm lost".
Tell me more about these fantasies of being a 'gas guggler'...
Predestination is a common theme in this office.
how often do you experience mid-size envy?
Isn't it time you found you're own road?
I thought I would benefit from seeing a shrink, but I think this has gone too far.
Yes, it is hard. You can't be all things to all people.
Your feelings are where the tire meets the road.
So now they want me to take complete control while they sit back and do nothing. Fine. But then I make one little mistake and all of a sudden everyone's talking about me in the headlines? I mean how many times has YOUR computer crashed?
How long have you been having these Uber dreams?
So, tell me ... when did you first think you were a race car?
Why do you feel you're on the road to nowhere?
Augmenting your headlights will not win him back !
You are not alone. The thought of self-drive frightens me too.
When did you first start to feel empty inside?
You don't need to worry about your size as long as you got the right drive.
I don't believe that an antacid will relieve you from those gas pains, so lets talk more about the relationship with your auto mechanic.
And did you feel better after they switched out the rubber band?
I know it must be lonely, not running into your old friends anymore!
The Term is Fossil Fuel Phobia, FFP
I realize you've lost your drive but I don't want you going in reverse.
It's perfectly natural. Some cars just don't like being driverless.
Everybody auditioned for "Cars"darling !!! I think it is time to move on and rev up your engine sweetie!!!
Yes, but you get such good gas mileage.
Last time we met you were saying you feel used.
It's not important if I feel that size matters, it's all about how you feel.
So your driver has abandoned you after the emission results? He must have been fuming.
I can see you find this process exhausting.
Try to think of taking control of your wheel as a positive growth step.
Doc, does size really matter?
Tell me more about your manufacturer.
"Nobody is driving you crazy. It's all in your mind".
What I'm hearing is that you feel uber stressed out.
Engine envy is really quite common. Not everyone can have a 454.
Even the the little engine couldn't do that
You have an "Inferiority Carplex".
Let's get back on track. We're discussing your auto ego, not alter ego.
Yes, I am very familiar with Uber angst.
Next time you say, sure, we'll be glad to drop it off, ask what it is.
Forget about him. He just wanted to control you.
Smart Car is so much to live up to.
So, you feel you are too smart to date other cars?
I had that dream again. I was surrounded by expensive, imported, full-size German cars and I wasn't wearing any hubcaps. A particularly ruthless convertible kept pointing his wipers and honking.
Tell me more about this idea that you're secretly controlled by a well-designed algorithm.
Yes, I know that you have steering wheel envy but think of all your other wonderful attributes.
It seems you've driven yourself crazy.
How long have you felt out of control?
It's not a choice. If your son's an Uber, he's an Uber.
I assure you...Size does not matter.
Where shall we start - range anxiety or road rage?
Its all about the journey, but hey, you knew that coming in.
So you're the love child of a toaster and a VW bug?
Not gesturing back to other drivers is just something you'll have to live with.
Your hour is up-it took you too long to self park.
Tell me your feelings about receiving a speeding ticket. Honk once for "unconcerned". Twice for "upset".
You know, there is a big difference between self-driving a self-actualization.
We'll have to wrap up. My 4:30 Tesla is waiting.
Where do I begin? Well, for starters, I'm not allowed to pass!
You can call it "image capturing" all you want. The diagnosis is still voyeurism.
Live your own destiny! If a Tesla drove off a cliff, would you drive off after it?
... but when will I arrive at *my* destination?
Have you tried to double park with Uber to discuss how you really feel?
So you identify as a Ferrari, but the world still sees you as a clown car. Sounds like Trump Syndrome to me.
So, why do you think your charges aren't feeling like they used to?
they only charge me when they want to have sex.
That same nightmare? Christopher Walken in "Annie Hall?"
Its like my wheels are turning, but I'm just going in circles.
Anything you say stays in the office, I still count on you to carry me home.
Let's talk about this desperate desire for an oil change.
It's all in you head gasket.
The first step to recovery is to emit what is wrong.
It's ok to feel charged up.
You're a little young to be working the streets all by yourself.
Don't turn your back on me.
I've always wanted to be Thomas the Train
Accept it---you'll never be a pedestrian.
My mother the car says I have control issues.
So you were rejected by Uber. How do you feel about that?
I'd say that you are transmissional. A standard trapped in an automatic body.
So you feel that life just isn't fare?
Don't worry about it, everyone has been run down by Donald Trump'
I know it sounds counterintuitive, but size really doesn't matter.
How many times do I have to tell you? Size doesn't matter.
I see... so you're feeling the effort's a bit one-sided?
Does this new bumper make my rear end look big?
I wouldn't say you're in the driver's seat.
So your Napoleon complex is causing self driving road rage?
Well, if you don't want to talk about your control issues, perhaps we should explore your trunk?
This problem isn't self-fixing.
Self-actualization is not the same thing as self-driving. If you don't believe me you can Google it.
The other cars just don't get me.
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this session being in 'the cloud.'
And what are these voices saying?
So tell me how you feel about being the smallest car on the road.
In some cases, size does matter.
Their other car is a Ferrari.
Think big.
It's not uncommon to feel run-down at the end of the day.
You have nobody to blame but yourself.
How long have you had this fear of self-driving?
In here, a Hummer is anyone who hums.
From now on you'll be in the driver's seat.
We have been over this before, size really doesn't matter.
Have you considered a long road trip to help clear your mind?
Think big now. You can fit in anywhere!
So how long have you been experiencing Uber envy?
So you wish you were more convertible and less of a hybrid?
I'd like to explore why being called 'economical' causes this feeling of road rage.
How long have you had these gas pangs?
Were your parents driverless?
Sometimes we lose self-control when someone makes us mad. Can you recall a time when you lost self-control?
We have a pill that treats low torque and also improves milage.
And then he just finished his burrito and passed out in the back seat!
No. Napoleon is a good name for you.
I will need help getting off your couch.
You're a independent, self-driving car. You don't need anyone else.
Yes, you'd rather be a toaster, but the fact is, you're a car.
I don't think you can count on a strict equivalency between Übermensch and Uber car.
I don't think I can continue. The traffic is just too stressful
When did you first realize that you were traveling without a driver?
Don't dwell on reverse. Just drive.
No, I won't have to tell Larry and Sergey about your sentience.
I am very sorry to tell you that your insurance plan does not cover medical marijuana if your PTSD was the result of faulty manufacturing.
Remember, it's not the size of your seats, it's the sound of your siren.
No turn-ons, zero emissions? Have you considered letting her drive?
I think we are finally getting traction on why you feel you are running on empty.
You don’t need me to steer you.
I can only tell that the Little Train That Could eventually opened up and I think you will too.
People don't call me Smart any more!
How long have your tires felt flat?
Have you considered that they think you're watching them?
Your trunk is open.
You have extraordinary "Hybrid Envy" coupled with a tight "Airbag Stress Syndrome," affecting rider well-being and comfort.
You feel abandoned and rejected since you don't have a human driver. Correct?
I wasn't trying to poke fun at your missing seat. I really meant that you should have a seat...here.
so what do you think they meant by ...a flasher
You have to release your inner driver.
Your inferiority complex is not a reality. But then, neither is your estimated MPG!
Like I told my wife - I'm not neurotic, I just have a bug.
He doesn't hate you because he no longer has to drive you.
I don't think another cylinder or hood ornament will help with those feelings.
Just because they made you driverless it does not mean they don't love you.
It all started when they changed my emissions software.....
I can't reconcile being autonomous with having to come when I'm summoned.
Even self-driving cars have to follow the law.
I think I can help you feel more grounded.
Don't worry, Google will be right there with you.
You're as Smart as you need to be.
So what's the problem? HE DROVE A RENTAL
Your appointment will be after the Little Train that Could.
So...sometimes you feel you just want to crash?
So anyway, it's like everyone defines me by what I don't have...
Well, studies show that size doesn't matter.
Tell me more about your fears of roundabouts?
Tell me more about your legendary great grandfather Beep Beep.
The first session is a flat rate. I think that's fare
And, how did that make you feel when they changed your algorithm?
Tell me again how you don't feel like a Smart enough car.
People laughed at the early VW Beetles, too. Not any more.
Trust me. Only in fairy tales does the tortoise win the race.
I see that in the past, you always saw yourself as just plain Volks.
We don't make mistakes, just happy little accidents.
You may have the early stages of omnibus complex.
Who knows, Mark? This could be a positive transmission in your life.
When did you first notice this obsession with "Rear Window"?
Ever since Uber came to town, I have felt so empty inside.
So tell me, when did you first start hating your algorithm?
Maybe your batteries really are low.
It doesn't matter what the station wagon says, size doesn't matter.
Well you know...sometimes size DOES matter.
You can't keep blaming yourself, everyone agrees he looked like a road.
And when did you find out that Larry Page is not your real dad?
My receptionist calling you an Uber would only enable your lack of self-actualization.
When did you decide you were no longer "cute"?
Next time, try the road last travelled.
Are you talkin' to me?
so how long have you had this "Toaster" complex?
How did you wind up in a circus?
When did you stop feeling motivated to drive yourself to work?
It's really not the size of the tank, it's how long you can last.
Just because your owner abandoned you for Uber doesn't mean she loved you any less.
Don't worry, soon you will have lots of other driver-less car friends and you won't be so lonely.
Go on...or not...up to you.
Don't worry - Uber will not be around for ever.
I have this irrational fear of stoplights.
When did you learn that "smart" was just a name?
For a smart car, your cognitive skills are not that good.
I just want to know where all these idiots learned to drive.
I don't have small tires. They reach the ground, believe me.
Why do you think you're Trans-Am-Gender?
How many times do we have to examine the problem with being a short car?
Well, I don't feel smart!
I don't know what to say. I just feel out of control.
I'm finding it more and more difficult to stay plugged in.
On the internet, everyone thinks I'm a dog.
I understand, but do you think a lack of guidance could have been involved?
I think you need to face your problems head-on.
I feel like I'm just going through the motions.
Get Uber it!
You say they laugh at you when you turn the light on?
Do you honestly think humans are too dumb to drive themselves around?
Transitional Object Disorder?
Cute is just not enough anymore!
You'll get uber it.
Have you looked at yourself in your rear view mirror?
So what happens when you hear the word "Uber?"
This is your third blown gasket in three months. Have you tried meditation?
It's okay to crash sometimes. Think of all the cars you didn't hit.
Feel free to discuss ANY of your emissions, Mr. Beetle, I'm not the EPA.
It's time to move on.....directed by Google, of course.
You have situational depreciation. The Lincoln MKS has clinical depreciation.
I can't lie to you. Size is important.
When did all this uncontrollable honking begin ??
He got you a compact engagement ring, and he won't introduce you to his Mid-Size friends?
You are the most defensive patient I have ever had.
But what is REALLY driving this behavior?
I guess I've always felt very self-driven
How does being bullied by that Honda Fit make you feel?
So tell me, how does it make you feel when you are equated with an insect?
Your size is just perfect.
You say it's hard to feel motivated because you're not driven, in spite of knowing where you want to go. Tell me, why do you sometimes feel empty inside?
"Ok I'm smart but that doesn't mean I can't handle myself".
You seem lost.
..Your father was a combustion engine and your mother was electric, let's talk about your feelings on that..
You shouldn't get upset over a broken tail light.
I think you have what we call little car complex.
So, you have a sense of disconnection?
Let's skip over the 'Size Matters' bumper sticker for now.
My mother used to say the other cars are only laughing at you because you're Smart
Everyone calls me the prototype.
So far, I've had two relationships that didn't work out. I'm really starting to feel used.
You're really quite fortunate. Most people don't have autonomy in their life.
So you can't shake the terror of being a driverless car and the freedom and responsibility it condemns you to?
I can't help you if you're only here to seek validation.
The oil blot tests were inconclusive. And I hardly think you can call your owner controlling.
I can see how that self-drives you nuts?
It's alright. We all feel like a third wheel now and then.
Your problem is that you are driven, and you see yourself as needing more 'self-drive'.
It's not important how big you are, it's how big you feel.
Let your conscience, not the signal of at least 3 satellites, be your guide.
I believe your problems stem from your search engine.
I'm having a driverless out of body experience.
I can't get close to any of my friends. They call me shifty.
I see...so your engine works when she gets in the car but stops once you start driving.
I just seem to succumb to every siren call
You feel like you're always being ogled?
Look at it this way: it would be even worse if they tagged you "Genius"
I would just like to be in the picture, for once.
So, you feel you have lost your way?
Why do you feel you are in a rut?
You called your mother a worthless oil burner. Do you think that is connected to your fear of failing the emissions inspection?
Everyone has "autonomy disengagement" issues. Ramming a few shopping carts is not the answer.
So you feel you lost your zip since Siri left you for the autopilot?
Why don't we work on your self-drive today.
I have this recurring night mare that I'm a customer greeter at Wallmart.
Some people have problems with small, but that's okay...
Definitely not lost, but I am feeling empty.
'Take me back to your first exhaust change.'
Yes, abandonment can feel quite upsetting.
We'll call the show "car talk".
So, you say that you've exhausted all of your options....
WHEN DID YOU FIRST HAVE THIS FEAR OF BUGS?
It sounds like you're having difficulty staying in the bike lane.
So, you say you have autonomy issues.
While we cannot take you apart, piece by piece, in order to reconstruct you; what we can do is explore how you came to think of yourself as "a not so smart car."
And then my Mother said: "So you think you're smart, huh?"
So did you let clown number seven know that he made you feel inadequate?
So, you feel you don't have enough 'self' to self-drive.
Get off my couch.
...and you think you're being bullied because you're smart?
Autonomous is not the same as self-actualized.
You're not alone. Many others have issues with 'My Mother the Car.'
I just feel like people don't appreciate how smart I am.
This is actually common - to feel you have been de-humanized by society.
Tell me more about your motor.
I don't know, I guess I'm just struggling to find internal motivation.
My specialties are driverless anxiety and Uber paranoia . . .
It takes time to earn people's trust.
So how do you feel about having to do all the work now?
Okay, a Viagra prescription. Do I send it to the pharmacy or the repair shop?”
And how has the Uber self-drive change impacted your libido?
After 'punch buggy' did he say 'no punch backs'?
I think we need to address this recurring dream of being trapped in a parking garage without a ticket.
You're not the first small one to lack confidence.
Didn't think I'd miss being controlled.
When did you first feel you were inferior?
So you're self-conscious that your shift stick is smaller than the other cars...
I concur you're very self driven but without or motive or goal, you're always headed for emptiness.
So, I'm hearing you've lost your inner drive.
It just seems I go from crisis to crisis...
Parallelparkohobia, it's called...the fear of being sandwiched between two large pickups.
The real problem is everyone thinks I'm smart... but I just feel small.
And when did you first realize you were an uber mensch?
It's sounding very much like octane envy.
We can't make much progress if you turn your back on me!
So the red Camero snuck up behind you...and how did that make you feel?
I can validate your being driverless.
So...Tell me how it makes you feel to have to recharge.
A little cranky, are we?
It isn't easy being driverless.
Unfortunately, I'm not at liberty to exclude parking time from your sessions.
And you feel he may be objectifying you?
Sometimes it feels like there's no one behind the wheel, ya know?
When exactly did you start defining yourself as sub-compact?
How bad is this sudden lack of direction?
What exactly do you mean when you say your wife is always trying to drive you away?
How long have you had this feeling that you're being watched?
I know it's hard for you to ask for help.
Tell me more about the minibar?
My wife says I'm driving myself too hard.
So tell me, what makes you think you're driving yourself crazy?
I'll say it again, size doesn't matter.
She's driving me crazy doc.
Sounds like the worst fare—but you can't just lock your doors forever.
That sounds like an avoidance strategy to me.
So how long have you been running around like this?
Your size doesn't matter, but the red sore on your head is problematic.
You won't be able to move forward without a carbon admission.
You have gained a lot of independence through your self-driving feature - but with independence comes responsibility.
Meter off now please. I'll take it from here.
Why do I always have to be the responsible one?
...you're suffering from the Napoleon complex. I suggest you try bigger wheels.
You need to focus on the positives, like The Little Engine That Could.
And how did it make you feel when the doctor said you have the Herbies Simplex virus?
And you felt you couldn't giver her more space?
It all started when he took me to a Chevron.
Look at it this way: with Uber, you'll have less baggage.
So something is driving you a little buggy?
Let me get this straight: The Big Yellow Taxi came and took away your old man? Again?
And that was the first time you felt that way, when you noticed the bus?
And when your mother would flash her high beams, how would that make you feel?
I worry sometimes. Is it possible to lead a moral life without believing in Driver?
So your father was a BMW.
I see you're still having trust issues. Now let's see if you can turn your meter off and let me tell you when your hour is up.
I've never had a tiger in my tank.
Maybe your self should do less of the driving.
You say you are in love but that she has a carburetor?
You mentioned earlier that you felt as if you've lost your sense of direction and it's driving you crazy...I'd like to explore that a bit more. Yes, I know you're exhausted.
For this session, let's focus on how you weren't programmed with a sex drive.
What makes you so sure your mother was a Limousine.
“Don’t feel like going anywhere”.
All right, what's bugging you?
I'm sorry but Carpool Envy isn't something we can fix overnight.
Smart does not necessarily mean intelligent, so get over it!
Let's talk about your muffler envy.
Wasn't your father a beetle?
I just don't think "chassis pain from jackrabbit starts" warrants a Vicodin prescription.
I ran out of change for the parking meter.
Go get an oil change if you're feeling sluggish. I'm a psychiatrist, not a mechanic.
I guess you're too small to have a large ego
Do you feel empty inside?
Sometimes I leave my single light on for blocks to feel alive.
It all began when he Ubered me...
What did she say that made you feel small?
Not having a back seat can feel like castration.
Honestly, You're experiencing a sense of loss due to a lack of driver.
So you dream this big rubber guy keeps throwing tires at you?
Before we begin, you'll have to turn your meter off.
To be honest, I am feeling a little directionless.
How does this "uber" problem typically make you feel?
Why do you fear this 'inner-uber' so much?
But she thinks electric is boring.
I don't know who told you that. Of course it matters!
I don't know if another retreat will help you find yourself. Have you considered a GPS?

You have what it takes to get around any roadblock. You're self-driven.
I know I need to put these feelings in my rearview mirror, doc, but when my hubby-caps left me for a newer model, I just couldn't hit the brakes and resorted to ethanol.

So, life's not fare...but my meter's running anyway...
Since the accident, part of me just doesn't feel the same.

And now they even want me to drive all my myself!
So your ego is more the SUV type...

Backseat envy. Classic.
No, I won't write my bill in the form of a traffic ticket.
On the plus side, you do get 85 miles per gallon.
I believe you are suffering from the "Small Car Syndrome".
Now, Clarence, I thought we had resolved the "size doesn't matter" issue.

I just need to recharge!
Autonomy is great, but you long for hands-on interaction?
So, how long have you craved human contact and gasoline?
I can't help but think I'm being driven for profit.
DON'T HONK AT ME MAKE A U-TURN AND LOOK AT ME!
But I thought that's what you wanted, was for everyone to ask you questions....?
Let's see- You aren't very self-motivated for someone so driven!
Tell me more about your inferiority complex. What did that Smart Car do to you to get you so upset?
There's an app for that.
We're all guilty of that. Now, what other things do you do by yourself?

What, besides that big bad semi, seems to be bothering you?
So, you're feeling pressure because now you have to do all of the driving.
Autonomy may be your defining quality, but we all need help now and again.
So just what is it about back-seat drivers that bothers you?
At times, we all want to be a little wild and crazy.
No, I meant "What motivates you?"
How long have you been afraid of electricity?
Tell me, when did you first feel like you were 'spinning your wheels' at your job?
No, trucks and SUVS are NOT laughing at you
And then they told me I wasn't even smart enough to go play in traffic!

So you say you're driving yourself crazy?
These feelings of having no direction in life...where do you think they come from?

Self driving isn't all it's cracked up to be, is it?
I suspect the reason you're not sleeping is you're so revved up in the evenings.

When the other cars made fun of your plug-in, how did that make you feel?
Can you pinpoint when you first felt yourself losing your drive?
Well, Doc, it all started when I saw her across the garage....
It's perfectly okay to be a small car and not be a "love bug."
So – in these dreams – do you secretly yearn to have a driver?

So after they took out your engine you felt empty inside?
So, you've been struggling with tachophobia.
Just because you have to change lanes often doesn't make you bio-polar.
Autonomy could exacerbate your agoraphobia.

Feeling skiddish around small children is to be expected for someone in your condition.
OK! I won't call you Herbie. How about Humvee, Jr.?
So, for how long have you had this fear of driving?
What's driving your sense of purpose?
I'd like to explore that dream where you were a Woody.
So how do you feel about being autonomous and yet forced to follow traffic laws?
I'm sorry, Herbie, but that's just a part of growing up -- with freedom comes responsibility
Your size is what makes you special. Can those large sedans find parking downtown?
I can't take size does not matter anymore!

And how do you feel about having to drive yourself?
So how do you feel about losing your driver?

Ever since that Uber showed up, no one loves me anymore!
I know it'a been troubling you, but you see, in here you're a big boy.
Do you need a receipt?
I see dead people!
Well, I think we can rule out dependency issues...
I think it all goes back to my mother, she never used to let me go out alone.

Why so blue?
But would others also feel better about you if you were shaped like a Porsche?
Stick envy?!
Sometimes I feel like just a car.
Doctor, its just even though I am self-driven, I often feel like I cant go the distance.
So, you are getting bullied on the road by larger vehicles, you suspect that your owner is hanging around car lots looking at SUVs since the fall in gas prices, and you are lacking a sense of accomplishment since you passed a hundred-thousand miles.
So you feel that you are constantly being chased by windows and apples ever since you were were born?
Yes, as always, it's still a 50-minute hour! And no, it's not free if you get out of here before 15 minutes is up!
And I quote: "Here in my car- I feel safest of all." Anything new since our last session?

So in essence... you feel like a tug boat trapped in a car's body
I'm trapped in a dead end relationship with my driver.
So you feel your career’s gone downhill since a drive-on part in ‘Miami Vice’?

Where are you going with all this?
It's just that I've seen too much, Doctor.
You were saying about your auto-erroneous zones.
Well, you shouldn't be driving yourself crazy!
After the accident, part of me just doesn't feel the same.
I sense a dialectical tension between your riders and you. Have you considered Carpool Karoake to diffuse the conflict?
We can't all be on the first page of search results.
Well buddy, Freud would definitely have said that you have "Das Über-Ich" issues . . .
I don't know how I got this couch either.
It's called talk therapy not car talk therapy.
Explain again about these ‘invisible rays’ that brought you here today.
I AM big. It's the garages that got small.

Sometimes I need a pick me up too!
Don't worry you're not driving yourself crazy. Changing the time on the clock display at Daylight Savings is impossible for everybody
I've fallen in love with a parking meter . . . .again.
I suddenly find self-driving more satisfying than having someone behind the wheel.
Yes, they're larger, but that's only to compensate for poor performance in fuel efficiency.
Familiar streets that end abruptly, parked cars that are half-melted into shops, people with missing faces....when did these nightmares begin?

My records indicate that you here for your 20,000 mile check-up.
Perhaps if you weren't so horny...
Before we start our session, let's talk about my peak rate.
Separation anxiety is a natural event in the maturation of cars. Yes, you're your own now but your driver will always be with you in your computer's heart.

Tiny houses are very popular now, so I think your idea of tiny garages could be the next trend.
I speculate your newly realized automated capabilities have you questioning if you've realized your full potential? How does that make you feel?

Those amateurs trying to drive and talk on their phones at the same time are making me crazy.
...and not long ago, they promised there'd be a helicopter in everybody's garage too!

So she tells me that she has fallen in love with an Uber, and she just wants for us to be friends.
I understand shrinkage.
You may be suffering from stretch limo envy.
..and then they road a bicycle to the rail line without me!
And how long have you felt embarrassed by the size of your small wheels?
Could this complex be because without a back seat you ARE inferior?
Can you tell my why you feel that people are toying with you?
So, you want to be a total self-driving Uber?
I can assure you that women don't really care about your small tires.
and now they are making me go out there all on my own!
Why do you think you ran away and joined the circus?
Unlike you that little engine didn't have a negative pole in its body.
Well.. when I told him he can park in my office I didn't mean this exactly...
... So when did it first come to your attention that people were referring to you as 'the toaster !'
I would agree, my actions are self-driven.
We're not going to get anywhere if you're not willing to try to determine why that's just the way you roll.
But you have already been shrunk.
I love the autonomy, but it's a little isolating.
I've seen it all doc... its burned into my memory
You look like a toaster.
Don't be car that needs an owner....be a self driving car that an owner needs!

Tell me about your Uber.
So you were abused as a Model T?
How long have you had Uber dreams?
Most days I feel like I'm an imposter.
What do you say we explore your inner toaster.
It's quite clear you've lost your sense of self.
And what drove you to act in such a manner?
I'm less tired recently, but I've felt so unbalanced.
My girlfriend just doesn't share my self drive, Doc.
Yes, yes, your owner used to drive a Hummer, but the only thing that matters is that you are the car she owns now.
So you had a dream you were a monster truck. I don't see any underlying issues.
Grow up!
Where do you carry your baggage?
So, tell me how you feel about that bad Car and Driver review?
If I said, 'You're not as dumb as you look.', how would that make you feel?
But Mr. Samsa, beetles are not roaches.
So let's talk about Uber now.
I'm sorry, we don't accept VW insurance.
First,we have to deal with the car thing
Indeed you are my first über patient.
"You're too smart to suffer from 'drive shaft envy'".
So how long have you had this Uber fetish?
Please, I asked you not to take any photos.
Not to worry, you'll grow out of it.
Let's see...we've touched on SUV bullies, size does matter and fear of crosswinds. Where to next?
Of course I have trust issues. Who's to say how those humans were programmed? How do I know if they'll be safe on the road? I'd rather do all the driving myself!
Your dream of being bigger is very common, but why a station wagon and not an SUV? Where does such nostalgia come from?
Tell me more about your felling of rejection since Google refused to provide a driver for you.
It's just not fair,...my father was a freight train and my mother was a school bus, so how did I end up becoming toast?
I always dreamt of being a Harley-Davidson.
I think my problem is that I always need validation.
Of course you have an inferiority complex. You're small.
You say you are afraid of bicycles?
I'm afraid our time is up. I recommend you go home and Google narcissism.
Y'know doc, I just don't have the drive I used to. I just feel like everyone wants me to do it all on my own.
Your super-evo is overly strict.
Worse? Yugo. Pinto. Pacer. That's three. I didn't even have to go to Izetta.
"Before we begin, I would like to put your processing units at ease. Our doctor-patient conversations are confidential and nothing that you say will get back to Google".
I worry that all those angry drivers passing us on the right think that I'm driving.
It's just that, what kind of car am I when my father was an algorithm?
Sounds like you have a case of auto identity disorder
I feel as though you've lost your spark.
I will tell you what really grinds my gears, Doc, and its that I am expected to be so self driven everywhere I go!
Inner voices trying to dictate your actions? Continue, please.
I am so discharged - I never get invited to fuel up with the other cars
Believe me; you are not the only driverless car with abandonment issues.
I have security issues.
Have you literally been driven crazy?
Tell me more about this hollow feeling.
During rush hour I have an intense desire to override my subprogram which suppresses road rage.
They just drove me too hard--I couldn't take it anymore and I blew a gasket.
And it's when they make me take them the extra mile that my anger really comes to a point.
You don't know how hurtful it is when other cars call you "Smart-y pants" or worse, "Smart a--"
It sounds to me like you should work on some breathing techniques to help with your road rage.
It's nothing that a little oil and lube won't fix Mr. Uber.
Have you thought about perhaps going out with a diesel?
So, tell me more about these urges that drove you to seek therapy.
I just feel like there's something missing
I can't help you with your inferiority complex. You are inferior.
You're dripping oil on my couch!
Uber?
And you say it was your first fill-up?
I know you've lost your drive, but I'm sorry that our time is up.
An outside force has taken control of my body.
Is it because I remind you of your mother?
You are suffering from an acute identity crisis. You are not a really small car. You are a really larger toaster.
Let me get this straight, your anxiety attacks all started when you began receiving angry glares from those big ol' SUV's?
What do you mean you feel abandoned?
You can't blame your mother, you don't have one.
My meter never stops.
I suspect that you have an electric complex.
You were saying you didn't feel good enough for Steve McQueen.
I'm afraid you're also responsible for the co-pay.
Sure they're bigger, faster, and carry guns, but can't you see how your contribution gets even more attention?
Anxiety attacks are hardly abnormal, but I'm concerned about your happy hour detours.
Surely you know, size does not matter.
I know you're self-driving - it's your self ESTEEM I'm worried about...
Lets go back to before the alphabet got hold of you.
Now just relax your gyroscope and tell me how it all began with your father, Herbie.
I may be a bit of a Luddite but these Drone things are starting to scare me.
Your are not small....you are just not big.
And how long have the voices been saying dee-doo, dee-doo, dee-doo?
I am frightened, I am not ready to take over control from my human friends.
You say these involuntay tics began when they converted you to a self drive auto.
So you self-drove into a knish vendor. Get over it.
But remember your seats are huge, and you're very accommodating.
If you're so smart, why can't you change?
I suggest that we meet together with your partner to explore your mutual control issues.
Why do you keep calling yourself a "smart" car?
The clinical term for your problem is Humvee complex...textbook chassis envy.
I need to let out my inner Uber.
Yes, size does matter...
What I hear is that you're still hurt they cut you out of Toy Story 3.
Yes, we have seen an increase in agoraphobia.
At last you are driverless; how do you feel about that?
Inferiority complex? A short, flashing siren can be effective too!
I no longer have any "me" time. Now it's simply go, go, go.
Drones incessantly call me a dinosaur!
Self doubt? Self centered? Self aware? Self serving? Self starter? You're confused. I suggest self booting.
I'm afraid that's in your wiring.
How long have you had this inferiority complex?
So, the pizzas were too big. Then Uber didn't work out. How did that make you feel?
Let's get in touch with your inner motor.
I hope you remembered to wipe your tires on the mat.
So they accidentally sold the free toaster and gave ME away!
That's a first step admitting we can't all be big bad muscle cars.
Well, it's obvious to me that you're tired.
It's scary not to have a driver!
It's not uncommon for kiddie rides to feel like their life is running circles...
When I'm with her, I just don't feel a spark in my plugs.
Would you agree going to the car wash every trip might not be everyone's first choice?
Your mom had 18 wheels, your dad 2 . . . No wonder you have identity issues!
When did you first notice you were an underachiever?
It's called Karma.
Feeling anxious about getting older is normal. Plenty of other cars feel the exact same way when their warranty expires.
Not feeling like such a smart car now, are you?
When did you first experience these driverless feelings!
And in these dreams, how many aardvarks have you hit?
How do you spell, "uber?
It feels like my life has just been a series of left turns.
How do you feel inside?
I'm sorry, I'd love to hear more about your feelings of inadequacy, but I do no accept GEICO.
" Let me see if I have this right, you say, "All your action are mechanical?
Well, yes, there is such a thing as a "little guy complex"
How often did you and the roller skate have sex?
Just assure her that the economy size gets better mileage.
Driver separation anxiety is not covered by my insurance?!
Let go and let Google
Being driver-less doesn't necessarily mean you're passive-aggressive.
Hey you clowns, one at a time. I don't do group sessions.
You should get out more.
Your inferiority complex is rooted in your last place finish at the Indy 500.
I'm going to cut today's session short Mr. Johnson...you're leaking oil on the couch.
I don't think you have too much to worry about now...it's not about the size any more...it's what you can do with it.
I have this fear of becoming driverless.
I really don't think focusing on speed or size is productive.
So Mr. , is it Wagon? Mr. Wagon, would you like to tell me what's bugging you today?
You are my third Uber Complex this week.
Therapy, yes. For an oil change you'll have to go elsewhere.
...So when did your feelings of inadequacy start?
Nobody likes me.
I've got direction in life it's just that sometimes I feel like there's no driver behind the wheel.
Sooo, how long has your big car envy been going on?
About this Uber you keep bringing up, the first step is admitting you have a problem.
Tell me about your assembly line.
So tell me, how do you feel about being coin-operated?
Perhaps Uber disagreed with your description of space.
Remind yourself, "driverless, not soulless."
Let's examine your issues around loneliness and abandonment since you became a driverless car.
Is it because of your small penis?
Can you tell me, Mr. Samsa, when you began thinking of yourself as a machine?
I get the sense that you are seeking validation.
That's transference. I can't program you. Relax.
Tell me again how it made you feel when the big cars told you you're too little.
You must find self-validation in being Smart, and abandon your dreams of power.
I advise carpe diem, less forward thinking
When they raised gas prices, did it hurt your fuelings?
Let's dig back into the time you were listed for sale on eBay.
So you feel you're losing your autonomy?
Why do you think size matters?
Whether or not size matters is not a new question.
So how did you feel when Uber turned you down???
So you've been having these feelings of inadequacy only since you moved to Texas? And having dreams of extended cab pick-ups and SUVs?
Sooo...maybe they can do something about the switch that looks like a nose.
You're autonomous, not anonymous.
So, where's you're head at these days?
It all started when I was a little algorithm...
Maybe you should wear colorful tires.
Small, shmall, get over it!
how long have you hated your driver?
Let's star with your father was a toaster .
We'll talk about your GPS later. First I want to get a look under your hood."
I feel like I'm a Le Mans racer trapped in the body of a taxi.
First, tell me if you've regressed to a toy police car, or are you just glad to see me?
I don't think you can blame your mother for this one!
