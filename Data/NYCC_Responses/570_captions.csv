You shouldn't have opened that can of worms.
You might want to rethink your ringtone
Normally, one in the hand is sufficient.
It could be worse, squirrels would be after your nuts.
THE St. Francis?
You have got to stop tweeting.
I think you're supposed to scatter it on the ground.
It's called a cluster flock.
Is that a new suet you're wearing?
My favorite? Rear Window. You?
Dad, that's not what it means to have Twitter followers.
Maybe because they took down that Confederate statue.
I didn't say you couldn't replicate their mating call. I said you shouldn't.
I ‘ve often wondered what happens if you exceed 140 characters
Why do birds suddenly appear every time you are near?
:What was it like, working for Hitchcock?"
You need to establish a pecking order.
Awesome! Now do the mating call of the black-throated green warbler.
I see your application for seed money was approved.
I didn't know they still made Cracker Jacks.
If given a choice, would you have picked a different superpower?
The seeded bagel may not have been your best choice.
Assisi, eh? What brings you to Brooklyn?
Impressive bird call.
Mr. Spicer, you can come out now. I think they've gone.
That was one hell of a bird call.
I've seen this movie. It doesn't end well for you.
Is that a new suet?
Maybe you need to close your twitter account?
Psst. It's me, Spicer. Are they gone yet?
Do they bother you ?
Do you mind. I came here to get away from incessant tweeting.
Try meowing.
Good thing they aren't woodpeckers.
It hurts a little more than the fish pedicure
So...you’re from Capistrano?
You're a chick magnet.
Yeah, some days you're the pigeon, some days the statue.
I'll get the cat lady.
...and here come the bees.
'To Kill a Mockingbird', why do you ask?
Really? Every year, Mr. Capistrano?
It's all fun and games until you're covered in bird shit.
Look. I'm not going to read this if you're not listening.
Ever see that movie—oooh, what’s the name of it?
It’s what we call a ‘tweet storm’.
First time on Twitter?
What do you mean you're a chick magnet?
First time in New York City?
No, I don't know why they're here every day. But then, I can't imagine why you're here every day.
There is a downside to being statuesque
This is not the best way to hide from the special prosecutor, Mr. President
That's what you get for being statuesque
How does it feel to be #1 in the pecking order?
That's the reason I always sit on this side of the bench.
Definitely don't feed the squirrels.
No politician in history - and I say this with great surety - has ever been more popular with the pigeons than you sir.
I see there's a downside to being statuesque.
Jeez, get a coop.
My tweet went viral!
You know I can still see you, right?
I see you also get a good response to your tweets.
This gives a whole new meaning to tweeting.
I think you're trending.
In the movie, this doesn't end well.
It's a good thing you didn't try a moose call.
Well, sometimes you're the statue and sometimes you're the pigeon.
Yes, and it's also true that birds of a feather poop together.
I thought you looked a little seedy today...
CUT !!!. The script says 'pecking' not 'landing'.
Don't worry. It says here they're migratory.
Stoolie Conference?
Carol mentioned that you started tweeting. How's it going?
At least it's not bees.
You weren't kidding when you said you could draw birds.
You know my uncle had the same thing but with emus.
Wouldn't it be easier to just use sunscreen?
Francis?
You can "unfollow" them, you know?
Why do birds suddenly appear every time you are near?
I guess I'm not the only one who thinks a statue should be made in your honor.
Great birdcall.
Man, you are so flocked...
Me? I'm a cat person.
Something similar happened to my cousin when he tried to feed the elephants -of course, that had a more tragic result.
You're in the clear: its a murder of crows, and a flock of pigeons.
It's probably your three-piece suet.
I think you're overdoing the tweets.
It says, "Move your arms and scream."
So how's that seeds and berries cleanse going?
I warned you not to let yourself go to seed.
Mr. Hitchcock?
I stopped sitting there for that very reason
Have you tried spreading it on the ground?
That superglue spray gets 'em every time.
Just be glad I didn't tell you about the bees.
Good news: they're curious, friendly birds native to these parts. Bad news: it's mating season.
I bring a book so they don't bother me.
Shall I call a cat?
I guess the owl sweater's not working.
I'm afraid the press corps has spotted you, Mr. Spicer.
Fine. You're the Prince of Peace. Happy now?
"Two in the bush" is looking pretty good right now, eh?
I take it you're not a cat person.
It’s fun until the woodpeckers show up.
Hey, a superpower is a superpower.
It's probably better if you just scatter the seeds instead of 'making them work for them.'
You know, you have to throw the bread crumbs.
I believe you've been flocked.
Well, I guess you have to entertain yourself some other way these days, eh, Mankoff?
You seem to have mastered that, now would you like to try the mating call of the bluejay?
Wait, we skipped step four. You were supposed to throw the bread on the ground.
By my count, that's worth 72 in the bush.
I'm an empty nester.
But they do bother me!
Hold your ground. Don't let them see fear.
Alfred, your next film is writing itself.
Have you considered a service cat?
How long were you in Alcatraz?
It will all make sense when the bees get here.
Oh David, not another shameless Hitchcockian cry for attention.
Wow. That was a hell of a birdcall.
I TOLD you your clothes were looking seedy.
That was one of the best bird whistles I ever heard.
So how many is this worth in the bush again?
This is why I don't tweet.
I'm more of a rat person.
Well, if they were crows it would be a murder!
Go ahead and keep the other half of that sandwich, Frank. I'm good.
I see why you lost your job as a scarecrow.
Next - let me tell you about the bees.
Well, now you're flocked.
Apparently birds of a feather also stick to you.
So, 7 Down is 5 letters, "The blank and the Bees".
Sorry. Wrong spell.
Maybe sunflower seeds are more of an indoor snack?
If they see you reading, they leave you alone.
You may want to think about tweeting less.
Oh, I wouldn't sit there.
They're gone, Spicer. You can come out.
Hello, my name is Bill, and I'm an empty nester.
If you think this is unpleasant, wait for the falcons show up.
It's always about you, isn't it?
You say this started when you were in Alcatraz
I have the most birds. The hugest flock. Bigger than ever before. They love me more.
The manual only says how to call them, not how to send them away.
Well the book says 'Mainly seeds and small insects.'
Tuppence for your thoughts.
You're wearing that to the Met Gala?
Those Tweets always come back to bite you
Looks like you're trending.
They're coming home to Proust.
That's why I don't tweet.
Mom warned me about the seedy characters I'd meet in the park.
Women, Larry. When I said 'chicks' I meant women.
You always did come first in the pecking order.
Always a chick magnet!
Listen, I know Tippi Hedren, you're no Tippi Hedren.
The Germans must have a word for this
That still looks like a better travel option than United.
You must be an empty nester.
Hmm, they really do stick together.
You exceeded 140 characters.
Technically, you're being assaulted by an 'exaltation'.
Your new suit is impeckable.
Well according to the guide, they are either Crested Turtle Doves, or Poison-beaked Eye gougers, hard to tell from the illustrations.
I'm more of a dog person, myself.
You say it started with a tweet?
Clever Mr. Spicer. If a hedge doesn't work...
I'm trying to read. Shut the flock up.
I told you not to get the everything bagel.
With every season, tern tern tern...
Is that a breadstick in your pocket or are they happy to see you?
So what was it like in Alcatraz?
You know that's not how you tweet, right?
That's what you get for excessive tweeting, Donald.
How's your everything bagel?
Your fly is open.
Shit happens.
Maybe it's your three piece suet.
Interesting. I don't detect any pecking otder at all.
No flies on you.
What did you tweet?
Wow! You've taken 'tweeting to a whole new level.
So what was it like in Alcatraz?
Nice suet.
How many re-tweets?
Don't laugh. The bees aren't far behind.
Wow, that was some birdcall.
I prefer reading to tweeting, but that's just me.
Reading is for the what?
Next, Son, I'll teach you about the BEES...
I think we're a bit beyond 'shoo, shoo' here.
I just checked in the book and I am sorry to tell you sir but the record is one hundred and eight birds.
Pigeon Whisperer?
Another open call audition Mr. Hitchcock?
So, then, all things being equal, you'd say that 'Hope' isn't the thing with feathers?
You should cut back on the tweets, Mr. President.
When you said you'd act as my wingman...
No, I'm not familiar with Hitchcock's films. Why do you ask?
So by my count, that's worth about 1,000 birds in the bush.
Apparently you don't need a computer to play "Angry Birds".
I guess you won the popular vote.
Don't know if you care, but there are geese heading this way.
They're called Liar birds, Mr. President.
And that's why I don't tweet any more.
Why don't you try turning off your Twitter feed?
My tweets never get that many replies.
Why don't I just shit on you, too?
They say that's good luck, you know.
i see you're wearing the Tippi Hedron collection
Beats vultures.
You're sending the wrong kind of tweets...
That must have been quite a tweet!
Seriously, do not feed the birds.
I heard it's good luck
You know you can block unwanted tweets.
I've always found that screaming helps right about now.
I warned you that was their seat.
you're doing it wrong
You couldn't have just one, could you?
I want to introduce you to a cat-lady I know.
You really nailed that bird call.
Maybe it's time for your "safeword".
You might try putting the bird seed on the ground
Bet you can't wait for my talk about the bees
Actually I am feeling a bit peckish.
So how did the 37 of you meet?
I'm reading a Hitchcock biography. Why?
How's your sandwich?
Perhaps you should have settled for two in the bush?
It would be nice if they picked up the dead bodies once in a while.
Me? I’d probably start with shoo.
Can I tweet this?
It's called Karma, Mr. Hitchcock.
I told you you look seedy.
Coo if your ok.
I believe thats's worth more than two in the bush.
It's almost as if you're in a New Yorker cartoon.
How goes the twitter feed?
Is that a worm in your pocket or are they just happy to see you?
I wouldn't worry - it says here they aren't carnivorous...
It sure beats woodpeckers.
I see a lot of things have come home to roost, Mr. Trump
I don't think that's how you're supposed to use the app.
Wait until I get to the Bees part!
I'd help, but I just got to the good part.
Just keep very still. They can smell fear.
You may be taking your bird watching a little too far.
Just don't get carried away.
At least you're not whispering to the bees.
And of course, there are also the bees.
Get a room.
You can come out now, the press is gone.
You said you once dated Tippi Hendron?
My wife says I'm unapproachable.
Oh, wait! There's a footnote that says not to whistle that birdcall twice.
And I thought I was a chick magnet
Bird whisperer?
Wow... you have a popular Twitter feed...
One time I was covered in squirrels.
You just got retweeted.
I can see something's eating you.
I would suggest meowing.
Hey, aren't you that famous guy from Alcatraz?
I'd run. I'd run so far away.
Wow - do they really suddenly appear?
Still not as bad as a Trump tweetstorm.
Your parents did not tell you about the bees, right?
That's some twitter feed!
Yup. They're of a feather.
No, even under ObamaCare, that doesn't count as a pre-existing condition.
At least the worms are gone.
It was this or United.
So, life away from the White House pressroom isn't much better, huh, Sean?
You might want to try the seedless baguette next time.
So Mr. Hitchcock, where do you get your ideas from?
You're right . . . you are quite the whistler.
Would you mind keeping the cooing down. I'm trying to read.
I think you've taken this a bird in the hand stuff a little to far.
Delete your account.
I'm a dog person myself.
I see you’ve landed a major coo.
Have you considered getting a cat?
That's why I prefer not to Tweet in public.
That's a lot of likes for one tweet!
I told you not to retweet.
Next time don't dress so seedy.
Wow, mister, you sure know how to pick up chicks.
Man, you are so flocked...
I told you that outfit looked crummy on you
I have the same problem with women.
You're being swallowed.
Excuse me, I'm trying to read. Could you get the flock outta here?
Crappy day?
There's something on your shirt.
If you hold very still, you'll have them eating out of your hand.
I thought you were a chick magnet.
Well, it's that or be an empty nester.
Perhaps you meant to wear "tweed"
Maybe you should reconsider speaking Pidgin English.
You may want to zip up your pants.
I guess that's what happens when you actually try to hit two birds with one stone. They never tell you they'll fight back.
Maybe you should head south for the summer.
I envy your charisma.
When were you paroled from Alcatraz?
Perhaps if you acted less statuesque...
It says here to just keep your coo.
Just leave me his wallet.
I think it's clutch, but it could be gaggle.
must be your statuesque physique
So when you said 'animal magnetism'. . .
Yes I am an ornithologist, why do you ask?
Looks like Polly did want a cracker
It's called Karma, Mr. Hitchcock.
Excuse me, someone's sitting there.
It's by Hitchcock. Why do you ask?
What idea would that be, Mister Hitchcock?
Do you mind? I'm trying to read.
Yes, it is a bird call book.
I'd avoid using the expression "This is for the birds" if I were you.
I'd rethink the chia suit.
I can still see you.
That's not what seed money is for
According to the book it's a covey, not a flock.
You should have stayed in the bushes Mr. Spicer.
It says here any second now your Ornithophobia should be cured!
Could be worse, you could be at the bee bench across the street.
I said you were looking a bit seedy.
Which part of “Wear a subtle disguise.” did you not understand?
I have a similar effect on mosquitoes
Stop whistling and start meowing.
New suet?
Panko was their gateway drug.
May I bother you for the time?
I still think reading is more relaxing than birding.
All we can do now is hope for the bees.
So, do you want to hear about my day?
It's the suet you're wearing.
Guys, guys. Leave something for the vultures.
They pecked him out of a lineup.
Personally, I stopped wearing 100% organic because of this.
I hope you guys have had your shots. He's been sitting there since Tuesday.
You remind me of Tippi Hedren.
Mama always said: "Life is like an Alfred Hitchcock movie."
If they poop on you it's good luck.
Hitchcock.......Why do you ask?
"To Kill A Mockingbird". Why? What are YOU reading...?
I've never seen a Tippi Hedren impression before.
I think your carrier pigeon mail has been hacked.
But seriously, why do birds suddenly appear every time you are near?
I told you NOT to sing a song of six-pence!
Guys--how about saving something for the coroner!
Well, what are the other benefits of joining the Audubon Society?
I can just see the bees heading this way.
I guess there are downsides to being statuesque.
It says here that they'll migrate in another day or so.
According to this, you should communicate directly with their leader.
Tell me more about seed capital.
I warned you about letting yourself go to seed!
Ignore the tweets.
It's not me, it's you.
Wow! You bring the term 'chick magnet' to a whole new level.
Funny, I was just reading about the birds and the bees.
Have you tried 'OFF!'?
I know all about the birds now, but please let's not talk about the bees.
Ironically, I happen to be reading 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'
Don't move, or you might startle them.
They heard you had a twitter feed.
Tell me again ... How many Twitter followers do you have?
Sign says don't feed the birds, pal.
Please stop the tweets, Mr. Trump.
You are SO flocked.
It's okay - she's gone now.
Looks like your tweets are going viral!
I'm feeling a bit peckish myself.
If you ask me, Vertigo is the better Hitchcock movie.
I never took those signs seriously either.
When did you get out of Alcatraz?
Been sitting there long?
Good afternoon Mr Hitchcock.
You're lucky you're not allergic. I can't even use a down pillow!
Shall I keep reading?
Meet the Flockers
They are still less upsetting than Trump's tweets.
So, why do birds, suddenly appear, everytime, you are near?
They seem to like you.
Pardon me, do you have any Grey Poupon?
First time to Central Park?
I think you're sitting on their side!
That's why I stopped getting the everything bagel.
Most people toss the bread crumbs.
I'm sorry Alfred, what were saying about your idea for a movie?
Here, Kitty, kitty, kitty.
Thanks, but I'm not interested in learning your bird calling techniques just now.
They like you. They really like you.
You need to stop Tweeting.
Get a room.
Come here often, Mr. Hitchcock ?
Told you tweeting was dangerous!
By any chance, did you ever spend any time in Alcatraz?
Bird, bird, bird. Bird is the word.
Maybe you should change your ringtone.
Overdoing your twitter feed?
I feel a Carpenters song coming on.
You might want to consider throwing the bread onto to ground.
You really should switch to email.
What are you? Nuts or something?
I would agree that you're the seediest president we've ever had, Mr. Trump.
As a scarecrow, you might want to find another line of work.
I told you you were tweeting too much.
Be happy it's not a murder of crows.
Must be the Dove body lotion.
Did you bring enough for everyone?
At least you can't see the tar now
I still say it's better than two in the bush.
no , I'm sorry , I don't own a cat
I have to say I've seen worse tweetstorms lately.
....and some days you're the statue.
That's what they call karma Colonel Sanders.
It's rare to see a friendly face along the migratory pathway these days.
Seems that I'm not as high up the pecking order as I had thought
That, my friend, is why I stopped using Dove soap.
When did you get out of Alcatraz?
I have a cousin in dry-cleaning.
Have you tried getting a cat?
You're getting a lot of incoming tweets.
They must’ve heard you say you were feeling crummy.
I guess that's the reason for the sign.
What the hell did you just Tweet?
That's some birthday suet.
Pardon me, do you have any Grey Poupon?
You're some nutty guy.
Oh, I thought you said you were a babe magnet.
A fine-feathered friend you turned out to be.
I told you that seedy outfit had to go...
Perhaps you should consider reducing the amount of gluten in your diet?
So this is what the late birds get.
You done tweeting?
I see you raised that seed money you were after ...
My advice to you, Ms du Maurier, is to write about what you know.
Sorry for not recognizing you earlier, Ms. Hedren.
I've met some seedy people at the park before, but this is ridiculous.
Know what you're going through. I'm hen pecked myself.
So that haberdasher's "three-piece suet" wasn't a typo?
Are you wearing a wire?
you seem to be high in the pecking order
Birds have never really liked me.
I'd really never given much thought to the problems of being a gingerbread man.
Clearly book beats Twitter feed.
Your tweet was obviously misinterpreted.
Good Call.
Do you have a favorite?
And you say this happens once a year, Mr. Capistrano?
That suit is impeckable
Perhaps if you sneeze.
Well, you've certainly got a serious case of avian glue!
Why, I believe you're right. That is a Kirtland's Warbler pecking at your left eye. How wonderful!
can you do that somewhere else?
Do you mind if I take a picture, before I call 911?
To Attract a Mockingbird: Chapter 7.
They must be homeless pigeons.
Tweet all you want; you're still not presidential.
So you just came from the Met Gala?
Some day you'll look back at this day and chirp.
'To Kill a Mockingbird', why do you ask?
Well, at least they're not angry birds.
Sometimes you're the bird... Sometimes you're the statue.
You'll have to speak up.
Not much. What's new with you?
"You got some nerve calling me bookworm, bird-brain!
Move a little so they don't think you're a statue.
What the flock did you say?
Tippi? You OK?
Your twitter following is impressive.
I like reading. Do you have any hobbies?
That's nice. I'm more of a cat person.
I warned you about over tweeting
Excuse me, Sir. There's a little something on your face.
Half the cartoons don't make a damn bit of sense to me.
Have you considered not feeding them?
What'd you tweet this time?
Maybe it's time to back off on the tweets.
Wow you have a lot of Twitter followers.
You're right, you do a great statue imitation.
Man, that's flocked up.
Hey, Hitchcock, I'd stay out of the shower today if I was you.
The point of quitting social media is to stop tweeting all together.
Is that 'Angry Birds - Virtual Reality Edition'?"
'You're looking a little under the feather today my friend."
Don't worry. It says here they'll be heading south next week
It's called a twitterstorm and you started it.
No, these are called homeless pigeons.
They sense you're a tourist.
I saw this kind of thing in a movie once; it didn't end well.
He gets all of the attention. No bench dweller, and I say this with great surety, has been treated worse or unfairly than me!
Maybe you should enter that bird call competition after all.
It must be nice to feel needed.
There's something on your face.
We live in a time of dangerous tweets.
Witness Protection Program?
I've found reading a book about cats is a very effective defense.
Why did you wear the hemp jacket?
That's what you get for being statuesque
Aren't you going to answer your phone?
Tippi?
All that was left of him was his tweets.
Is there a pecking order?
Two in a bush is probably better than 100 on your face.
I really should stop reading The Birds out loud...
You'll learn to ignore them....
It's a good cover but I still know you're tweeting.
My God, you must be good in bread!
They seem to like you.
Guinness says the record is 73
The election's over Bernie, you can cut it out.
I'd ask you about yourself but I can already tell you're whitebread.
What's in your lunch?
What the flock!?!?
That's why I stopped tweeting.
Get a cat.
So, where does that put me in the pecking order?
Wow... that new "Birds in Heat" app you downloaded really seems to work.
Looks like a coo d'etat.
Somebody tore a page out of my book! I have the worst luck.
Feathering your vest, I see.
How come you get all the chicks?
So I checked out this Harper Lee book, and now they leave me be.
So where do you get your ideas Mr. Hitchcock?
You may need to rethink those pheromones.
Yes, dermatologists are expensive, but that's the way I would go.
You must have been re-tweeted
I warned you that tweets have consequences!
A bit early to dress for the Met gala
You do realize that if you make it easy for them, they'll never become self sufficient.
It's New York. Sue somebody.
I'll pass on the sunflower seeds, thank you.
That angry birds app is really something!
Saint Francis I presume?
When you said you had a million followers on twitter I was expecting something different.
Tippi? That's a nice name.
White or wheat?
Excellent disguise comrade
You have more tweets than the president.
I have the same problem with porcupines.
At least they're not vultures.
Just wing it.
But you must have had another option under the Witness Protection Program!
You're not Teppi Hedron, by any chance.
It's better to read a book and let people think you're ignorant than tweet incessantly and prove it.
So , retirement is for the birds, huh?
It's curious how they intuitively know who likes them and who doesn't.
I told you that it was a crummy seat.
I thought that guy looked a bit seedy...
I don't think you understand the whole tweeting thing....
You must have showered with Dove.
Have you been listening at all?
Ever spend time in Alcatraz?
That's why I never get an everything bagel.
Looks like the coup flew you.
"As I grew up I was fervently desirous of becoming acquainted with nature' -- James J. Audubon.
So which one got the worm?
Bet you wont imprint with them again.
I wouldn't call that a cloak of invisibility.
It says here that they're attracted to despondency.
Your tweet went viral
I still don't understand Twitter.
You're showing your age Charlie. You used to be a chick magnet.
Can you say "meow".
Are you sure you aren't supposed to be in the Charles Addams cartoon on the next bench?
Excuse me, do you have the time?
The book says you should meow.
Do you have a favorite?
Is it already fashion week?
I think you should stop using 'Dove' soap.
You're spoiling them.
I am reading here that global swarming is not a hoax.
You really should have that looked at.
You can stop complaining about your empty nest syndrome.
I thought this guy looked like a seedy character...
No one has ever found me that attractive.
Nice pecs
I'm sorry, life is like a what?
May I borrow a pen?
I know how you feel. I'm hen-pecked at home.
They're doing that a lot since we took down the Confederate statues.
I told you those tweets would come back to haunt you.
That's why I'm not on Twitter.
Not sure I understand -- tuppence a what?
Could you practice your bird calls somewhere else?
Its right here in my book. Starlings travel in groups and can be annoying
I guess that your trending on Twitter
It might've been better not to tweet that you'd have "more than enough" birdseed for all of them.
I warned you about spending too much time on Twitter
I recommend you ease up on the tweeting.
I bet someone regrets wearing a Keep Calm shirt now.
Would you like me to post this on Twitter?
Personally, I'd rather be a chick magnet.
Can you please tweet somewhere else.
You must write awesome tweets.
It says here that they are swarming swallows.
...but I can't find it in The Guinness Book of Records?
I said wear your "tweed" jacket
I keep saying, you got to stop with all the tweeting.
The instructions say don't do that.
It was at that moment that Donald admitted he had a tweeting problem...
I thought it was a tweed jacket.
You're toast, man.
The guy who used to sit there always fed them
Witness Protection Program?
That looks like a flocking nightmare
So this is what a Twitter intervention looks like.
I got mugged in the park once, but it was different.
If you let yourself go to seed, what do you expect?
Supposed to be two turtle doves.
Would you mind tweeting somewhere else?
Great news grandma, guano's up two points
I usually come out here to get away from all the tweets.
I'm more of a dog person, myself.
It's kind of ironic for here I am in the middle of a reading frenzy.
You're new to Twitter?
I told you not to wear the seedsucker suit.
So, where do you get your suits cleaned?
I know it sounds crazy, but it says here that you should actually stop cooing and pouring popcorn all over yourself...
Would you like me to take a picture and post it on instagram for you?
I'm trying to read here.
Excellent bird call.
Do you know what time it is?
So you're back from Italy.
No politician in history has been treated worse by the pigeons than me. Hey buddy, pass me some bird seed, I seem to be running out.
That's what you wear to the park, a three piece suet?
You DO realize my suggestion to whistle "Bye Bye Blackbird" backwards was a joke?
You do bear a striking resemblance to Ulysses S Grant.
It says here there's an order to the pecking.
I don't think that's necessary, Mr. Spicer.
A seed for your thoughts?
Wow, you're a chick magnet!
I thought you said you were gluten-free?
They can smell seed capital a mile away
Never knew Hitchcock made sequels.
"What makes you think you've gone to seed?
Trying a new way to hide from the press, Sean?
Looks liked you're flocked.
At least the spider problem is solved. Should I order some cats?
Feeling a little peckish?
When did you know this was your calling?
Uh, Francis, is that you?
Tuppence, you said?
If you can keep that up till Halloween, you'll have it made.
Free range humans just taste better.
What's the inspiration for your next movie, Alfred?
You're obviously from out-of-town. Try affecting a sense of jaded 'je ne sais quoi'.
Do you have a pen that I could borrow?
Let me guess. Your name is Francis.
You promised you wouldn't make another scene.
I like you better in dove grey
Gwyneth herself uses the peanut butter and bird seed balm?
The vegan leather trend attracted some unexpected admirers
Is that a new suet?
Crummy day eh?
I also tend to lose myself in my hobbies.
You might want to try flapping your arms.
you're right. Best statue imitation I've ever seen.
There's a downside to all those tweets.
Birds of a feather stick together.
Don't worry about that, the signature at the bottom shows that it's just a dream.
It says here you're supposed to hold the birdseed in your hand...
I warned you to stop tweeting.
It might be time for you to stop talking about illegal migration, sir.
Mr. Spicer, please. Just stop.
What did you say the name of that cologne was?
You're feeling "peckish?" Yeah, I could eat. Oh....
Is that Lady Gaga you're wearing?
I do have a cat. Why do you ask?
So, just how long did you work in the Planters factory?
And it's still only tuppence a bag?
I've seen some statuesque people before, but nothing like this.
That's what you get for buying a cheep suit.
I told you not to order the 'everything' bagel.
Do you sell the eggs?
Hey, at least you're not pigeon toed.
Still pro immigration?
You could ask them to "Flock Off."
Some days you're the pigeon; others you're the statue.
I just thought angry birds was a kids game
See what happens when you buy pheromones online?
So this is how you get your news now?
I'm pretty sure it's only two birds and one stone.
Your Twitter feed is working really well.
I'm not the one who has gone to seed.
Your tweet's gone viral.
Bob?
I told you that Dove soap smelled funny.
You should try a gluten free diet.
One tweet too many, Mr. Trump?
I guess birds of a feather flock wherever.
Next time, brush the crumbs off.
What did you just tweet?
That's what you get for excessive tweeting.
Henry, I told you that seedy looking outfit was for the birds
No, I don't smoke.
You okay, Tippi?
Perhaps you could whistle a different tune.
I think the bushes are a better option, Mr. Spicer.
Ah, your a Hitchcock fan
This is what it feels like, when doves pry.
That explains the incessant tweets.
Coincidentally, it's a biography of the actor Walter Pidgeon
You should read books instead of playing Angry Birds.
It should be over soon, George—Apparently, “a brief descent upon the middle class” is part of their migratory pattern.
You're trending on social media
I'm looking for the same kind of attraction with women.
I see you're still embracing the "all-seed" diet, Bill
Been here long?
So much for the empty nest.
According to my book "So You Want to Feed Pigeons", yelling get away, get away, damn it get away is not your best bet.
Peckish?
So, how do you like Twitter's new drone service?
You'll certainly be white when they finish.
I'd say it's pretty clear who had the placebo.
Are you wearing "Obsession"?
I warned you about reading To Kill a Mockingbird out here.
I was just thinking you were statuesque.
It says here you should try to run, run as fast as you can.
I heard they poop before take off, in which case, you will have to find another way home.
So are you going to talk to me or just sit there like a statue?
Don't you just love Spring?
You strike me as a very peaceful person.
It was the nightingale, and not the lark that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear.
Please, enough tweeting already!
You know what your problem is? You don't share.
I guess I'm not of that feather.
Despite the title, Harper Lee offers no suggestions.
Missed a day, huh?
But how do THEY know you're an ornithologist?
You and your tweeting.
I told you that suit looked crumby.
Does this mean you're really popular on Twitter?
It says here that they're more afraid of you than you of them.
How many retweets did you get?
Okay. It says here that shouldn't be happening.
Hope you're wearing white.
So you end up getting total UV protection with the worm paste?
Still better than flying United, you say?
Let me know when you're ready for the cat.
I'm telling you, it is the whole grain diet.
Now might be a good time to impersonate a cat.
Look, either pay attention, or I'm going to stop reading to you
Maybe you should tweet about this?
Perhaps you should consider a new ringtone.
Apparently there aren't spam filters for carrier pigeons
Maybe you should have ordered that Reuben on seedless rye.
That's their seat.
First time I've seen a pigeon porta potty.
You might try a different dating app.
On the plus side, I hear being tarred and feathered is worse.
Oh, Francis! I almost didn't recognize you!"
There goes your bird's-eye view.
Don't you just hate it when the birds do that to you?
Enough with the tweeting!
I told you not to go outside wearing that crumby outfit.
Maybe you shouldn't be reading R. Crumb
That must have been one hell of a tweet.
Do you need any help, or are you covered?
"Its okay, she's gone".
All right, Tippi, you can come out now.
Reading DuMaurier again?
I told you the tweets would come back to bite you.
Gosh, wait till I tell my wife I met Mr. Peanut!
Excuse me, the time?
For the rich, they sing.
You must be the one they call The Worm.
Pigeon Whisperer?
"For some reason I keep thinking "STOOL" pigeons.
I told you that suit was looking a little seedy.
So you're saying they're your therapy pigeons?
You give too much of yourself.
Well .... you always claimed you were a chick magnet
That's some suet you've got on.
If you only had a brain.
So you saw the movie.
Would you mind?
How many tuppence did you have??
How do you feel about chicken tonight?
Once a bee-keeper, always a bee keeper.
Bookworm's over here, guys.
Are you listening to me? You seem distracted.
Can they remove Red Wine stains, too?
They'll be gone by Labor Day.
What kind of popcorn is that again?
Frankly, I think it's because you look a bit seedy.
What did you say your last name was, Alfred?
That's why I stopped tweeting so much.
Having a makeover, Cinderella?
I, too, find you quite attractive!
Have you ever been told that you bear a striking resemblance to Tippi Hedren?
Tweeting is overrated in my book.
I just say, 'Shoo!'
I take it those are all birds of a feather?
I see you are still using Dove.
We've told you s million times, Mr. President. You've GOT to stop tweeting!
Would you please just get the flock out of here!
Fashion week?
It says here that you've got a bevy, or a covey, or a dole...heck, you've got enough for a pie.
If you bothered to move once in awhile this wouldn't happen.
Exactly how long have you been waiting for the bus?
I've always said you have a way with birds
What were you reading?
How's the cannabis bird seed working out?
How do you keep the squirrels away?
Are you sure this is part of the witness protection program?
I would avoid reading To Kill a Mockingbird in this park.
I think we should contact the publisher because I don't see anything in the field guide about this.
Now all they have to do is put you on a pedestal.
The sign said don't feed the birds.
Would you please shut the flock up?!
I'd suggest a dab of cat urine behind each ear.
I 've felt crummy since the election too.
It's nice to be loved, isn't it ?
The original tweetstorm.
Are you listening to me?
It smells nice but I didn't even know that Tippi Hedren had a perfume line.
Well, this explains why you never see gingerbread men out and about.
Do you have any more of that popcorn?
Don't move. You might scare them away!
Well, Yes, you do look statuesque!
I believe there's a pecking order.
Face it, you're flocked.
Would you mind getting the flock out of here?
See. I was using "literally" correctly when I said you are literally the seediest guy I know.
I'm listening a Peter Gabriel album.
That's gotta be worth at least 72 in the bush.
That's why I read and don't tweet.
Nice suet you're wearing.
You're the one who didn't want a dog.
I told you that parfum d'oiseau was a strange name for an after-shave.
Have you considered a wall?
Run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me, I'm the gingerbread ma-
Well, Happy Birdday!!
All the bees just left with the last guy.
I think your tweet just went viral.
Forrest? Maybe it's time to put away the box of chocolates.
Doesn't one usually sprinkle the birdseed on the ground?
"No, I don't believe I saw that Hitchcock movie. Why do you ask?
Some days you're the bird, some days you're the worm.
I've never before heard of someone practicing to be a statue.
Ben and Jerry's release of 'Bird Food'...vanilla, peanut butter and sunflowers seeds."
Hey Buddy, I think you need to establish a pecking order.
Looks like you have a lot of unread tweets in your feed.
I don't think your situation calls for passive resistance
So many birds, so little time, huh?
I've always wondered where white doves released at weddings go !
Point taken, but I still prefer 'Psycho.'
You know, Ted, you should really try to go gluten-free.
Peace be with you.
Crappy day?
Shitty day, huh?
What kind of bagel was that?
He sure gets a lot of retweets.
You may be overthinking the "bird in hand" theory.
You'd think they'd enjoy a bookworm every now and then.
Look's like Trump's not the only one who's been tweeting too much these days.
So you did break out of Alcatraz.
It wasn't funny with squirrels, either.
The name's Hitchcock. Alfred Hitchcock.
May I get you a cat?
What are you, nuts?
I find throwing the seed on the ground a lot less painful.
I heard that you did some controversial research at the Cornell Ornithology Lab.
What's your secret?
Come on, you're the one who suggested Hitchcock.
I see you've gone to seed.
Sorry, not one recipe for squab.
You certainly are a chick magnet.
Sooner or later, Fred, you're gonna want a regular post office box.
They caught you, Gingerbread Man.
So much for the friendly skies.
Don't even think this will get you out of doing the dishes tonight.
I tell you I'm looking at it right now! Largest number of BEES, yes. Birds... Nothing
Look at it this way, your windshield is probably OK.
Your tweets are kind of distracting.
Reading another Hitchcock book I see.
Are you wearing the Eau de Pain again?
I told you that you were looking a little seedy.
"You've got mail".
You say your name is Tippy Hedren?
Nice to see you, Ms. Hedren.
I never used to believe in pheromones either
Here a tweet, there a tweet, everywhere a tweet tweet….
Fred, you're letting yourself go to seed.
Guess you've been here before?
"Do you mind . . . ?
I told you to stop using the new Dove Love body lotion!!
Would you prefer I read this aloud in pidgin English?
That suet fits you nicely.
You look like a bird person.
Dr. Dolittle, I presume?
Have you ever seen that Alfred Hitchcock movie, North by Northwest?
It happens every time MOMA kicks off the season with a Hitchcock retrospective.
I told you that was a seedy-looking suit.
Don't worry you have Obamacare !
I know they're endangered, but you're starting to look kind of iffy yourself.
It's the gluten, I'm telling you.
Are you sure they attract women?
The sky is falling. What did you expect ?
I think I'd rather do fur.
I think the author is really pigeonholing himself.
So this stranger on a train says to me, "I think you have vertigo." Then the lady vanishes. What a psycho. So, what's your deal?
That's strange; they usually wait until you're dead.
Dude, just tuppence a bag.
Gesundheit.
The book is always better than the movie.
Seems like your guano business has really taken flight.
friends from Alcatraz ?
You're flocked.
I'm more of a cat guy.
The last guy's loaf was gluten-free.
Hashtag been there.
You need a cat.
It's a more agreeable look than your autumnal squirrel fetish.
I used to have a camel hair suit myself.
Be glad they aren't vultures.
I told you not to play "Angry Birds" here.
Pardon my asking, but are you Franciscan?
I LOVED Michael Keaton in that!
I use "Eau de Falcon" !
As an ornithologist, do you take your work home very often?
I'm a ventriloquist who's quite good at bird calls
ya know my cousin had birds
Do you like birds?
It says here that birds evolved from small raptors,
Sure, sure. . .but are you THE Alfred Hitchcock?
Good thing you're not hiding in the bush
I imagine you stepped up to a premium seed.
I guess it's OK as long as you don't feel your're getting flocked.
Just out of Alcatraz?
You must smell fowl!
You know the one, it was directed by Hitchcock.
With me, its usually cats.
Get a cat.
You must be quite statuesque
That's why I don't tweet anymore.
What happens when the bird food's gone?
I think you should have a fidget spinner
Do you come here often?
I told you not to wear that seedy suit!
Karma's a bitch, isn't it, Mr. Hitchcock?
Jim, you might want to back off on that sunflower oil aftershave.
I did ask you to stop whistling!
If you sit too still, they think you're a statue.
They found you on the Internet.
It says here to stop whistling after ONE bluebird on your shoulder.
OK, now call the white-throated sparrow.
So, how's the bird pheromone business?
Any ideas for your next movie, Alfred?
It's about Alfred Hitchcock. Why do you ask?
Bread crumb disguise is certainly working
Can you shut the flock up please, I'm trying to read here!
Maybe you shouldn't wear the 'Team Exxon Valdez' t-shirt outdoors.
So how's your day today?
Perhaps it's time to consider laying off the Twitter.
It's not you. Someone just likes to draw birds.
Amazingly good return on your tuppence.
It says here you should never do that particular bird call during mating season.
You should you consider going gluten free. Worked for me.
Yes, Mr. Spicer, this is far more effective than some measly bushes.
How's work at the bakery?
Aren't you that guy on Celebrity Pigeon Coop?
So what exactly does an ornithologist do?
Man, I never get any attention
I thought only lawyers swarmed like that.
You give a whole new meaning to the phrase "gone to seed."
That Eau De Sesame is sure strong!
Who does your laundry?
It's one of the possible side effects of that new medication.
Who knew Trump kept birdseed under that thing?
Sir, your shoelace is untied.
I don't want to be a jerk but there's a four pigeon limit.
So when did you get released from Alcatraz?
She clearly said 'tuppence a bag' -but no; you had to be the big shot and give her six pence.
I'd say two minutes before you're covered in something else.
Do you think you could be my wing man tonight?
Mr Hitchcock, I have this idea for a movie. About Birds. People will love it.
Maybe you've given peace too much of a chance.
You gonna eat that popcorn?
It says here to just ignore them and they'll go away.
You're getting better at hiding, Sean Spicer.
Let me guess. You're wearing a seedsucker suit.
Where'd you get the three-piece suet?
Have you tried giving up gluten?
Wanna buy a cat?
So what cologne are you wearing?
No, it's with bears when you are supposed to stay very still.
You're tweeting too much.
Should I call for a hawk?
Says here they're pigeons
This tweeting is getting out of control.
Are you okay, Mr. Capistrano?
I ascribe to "believe it and you can be it", but you're over the top with that worm impersonation.
"Your genie must've misunderstood 'chick magnet'".
I was going to warn you about those birds. They were all over me yesterday. That's why I'm sitting over here.
Reading some R. Crumb?
That certainly was an impressive bird call.
You got their attention. Now what?
You know, there's an app for that -- it's called a cat.
They like you. They really like you.
Was that a french fry in your pocket?
Don't blame me--I didn't recommend the sesame seed bagel.
I see Pence beat you to the bushes this time.
Next time don't feed the birds.
Better you than me.
And you grew this following organically?
I see your tweets are generating plenty of attention.
You're not from around here, are you?
Impressive bird call.
..It looks as though you've pigeon-holed yourself..
Is this what they mean when they say you are trending on Twitter?
I think your tweet just went viral.
So you say it's an organic fabric made from Sunflower Seeds?
Are those artisanal breadcrumbs?
See, that's why I don't like like Twitter.
I always carry a book so I won't get bothered.
A bird flash-mob!! The rumors are true!
Alfred Hitchcock would be impressed.
I said, "You're really going to seed, fella."
How are you feeling, Larry? You seem a bit fowl today.
So, how's life at the top of the pecking order working for you?
This new dating app is for the birds.
Jonathan Livingston Seagull, I presume.
I hear that they are replacing the drug sniffing dogs.
Juan Capistrano dreaded the annual return of the swallows.
There may not be chicks in there, but you sure are a magnet.
Try not to move. They can sense fear.
I'm guessing they're Homo Pigeons.
And I thought the mosquitoes were bad.
It's your flocking problem, not mine.
I think you should have sprinkled on the ground Sir.
No, I think you CAN over interpret a Met Gala theme.
Maybe the organic, gluten-free, plant-based lotion was not a good idea.
I had the same problem until I stopped using Twitter
Henpecked?
Hey I guess you could say that this is a pretty hawkward moment
I used to feed them too.
You should cut down on your carbs.
I think you would really hit it off with this cat lady I know.
Francis? Is that you?
The chia suit idea appeared so promising on Kickstarter.
That's why I quit using Twitter.
You're in the cheep seat.
You shouldn't even dream about perfecting an eagle mating call.
So it all started with a single tweet?
So, Francis, where'd you say you're from?
Would you like to hear my bird calls again?
I still prefer a good book over tweets.
Feeling a little peckish?
I think they have mistaken you for Alfred Hitchcock.
Simple, just turn off your twitter feed.
I thought you were going to do Vertigo today.
I thought bird-watching would be harder when you're near-sighted.
Are you okay under there? I can't tell if those are angry birds or you're tweeting.
Yes, "The Birds" by Alfred Hitchcock. Ever heard of it?
You found a bottle of Tippi Hedren's perfume on E-bay?
Twitter notifications never used to be a problem.
Nice pecs
Stop tweeting!
You are sitting in Alfred Hitchcock's spot.
I've never had that many Re-Tweets before
It's probably a good thing you don't feed sharks.
Well, I suppose it's better than flying United.
I'm trying to read here. Will you just flock off ?
It must be nice to know you've been missed.
I'm afraid you've gone to seed.
Remember -- tuppence a day, and no more.
It says here you're flocked.
When you said you were pigeon-holed, I thought you meant at work.
Looks like dove at first sight.
Your cologne is for the birds!
Here, kitty kitty.
It's about the need we all have to flit in.
Maybe it's time to go a little easy on that all-quinoa diet
So Mr. Capistrano, you say this happens every year?
You need to move more. They think you're a statue.
They come every afternoon to hear me read "The Birds" out loud to them.
Looks like you got your full two-pence worth with that bag.
Are you Dale, from Craigslist?
That's why I don't get my news from Twitter these days.
You say you're about to cast the new Hitchcock film?
Sometimes you're the pigeon, and sometimes you're the birdseed
I told you to be more careful with your tweets
Francis?
It's better you hear it from a friend: I think you've let your body go to seed.
I could be wrong, but I don't think that's how Twitter works.
What the peck?!
Shame about the suit.
I warned you not to open that can of worms!
Wow. Now that's the kind of sleep I need.
That's why I don't sit on that end of the bench.
Is this Hitchcock or Assisi?
You look a little peckish.
Perhaps channeling Julie Andrews and singing "Feed the Birds" isn't such a good idea.
In San Juan Capistrano the focus is more on nesting and mating, but here in New York it's a more people centered event.
Wow, birds of a feather really do flock together.
Maybe you should get a cat.
I just don't know how New Yorkers live like this.
They have cell phones now you know......
They were out of onion so I got you sesame seed instead.
Just a thought, don't get the poppy seed bagels take-out.
They want me to come fly with them.
I believe you took their seat.
Tippi Hedron was really your grandmother?
You must be a regular.
Rethinking the plan to work as a living statue?
You're right, bird watching is more fun than reading.
Was it something you tweeted?
Climate change is reshaping the entire corpus of urban birding.
Next time you may want to bring seedless grapes.
To tell the truth, I thought you were a statue, too.
You might want to lighten up on the quinoa.
I have a 10% off dry cleaning coupon, if that will help.
I told you the sea salt bread crumbs would go over well.
Do you regret stealing the eggs?
Do you want to hear the rest of the story?
I told you the breadcrumb dress was a mistake, Ms. Gaga.
You have that new car smell.
I'm more of a rat person.
I think the angry birds found a pokemon.
Saint Francis made it look easier.
It's why I don't read seedy material in the park.
Anything new with you?
Wouldn't you know it: there's a seedy character in my book too.
This reminds me of a movie... you know that one, 'The' something-or-other? It'll come to me.
Isn't it time you tried to put Alcatraz behind you ?
I've never been a Hitchcock fan.
So you're saying the only reason they return to Capistrano every year is to hang out with you?
I always said you were statuesque.
The book says you need to get a cat.
I haven't seen much of you lately.
I told you that suit made you look seedy.
Shall I continue reading?
Vultures are everywhere these days.
Here you go, found a great fast receipt for squab.
You're literally for the birds!
Daphne DuMaurier.
Maybe life isn't a box of chocolates after all.
What's the word.
Sorry, all the tweets in the world aren't going to get me to vote for you.
And they call me the bookworm.
What are they whispering now?
It says here you have too much flaxseed in your diet.
To be fair he did look a little seedy.
Tell me again about the wonders of hemp clothing.
Stop teasing and give them the damn food already.
Oh, I wouldn't sit there if I were you.
I feel ignored.
I take it that you decided to fly Seth for the winter this year?
So it's climate change, right?
Tweet if you need anything!
No, I think that one's a spotted towhee.
Escape from Alcatraz?
What Peace organization do you belong to?
You're just going to love Venice.
Carl was always finding new ways to win at Hide and Seek.
So this is what happens when the city removes all the Confederate statues.
You might want to change your ringtone.
Getting a lot of tweets this morning?
What's for lunch?
You sure you don't need a napkin?
At least it's not locust.
I think they like you.
If I'd have known, I'd have lent you some of my tar.
I never really understood that movie.
They heard you were flying south for the winter.
This book is less intriguing than I hoped.
New to Capistrano?
That is why I never read Hitchcock at the park.
I guess that's one way to avoid being served a subpoena Mr. Flynn.
It may be easier if you just hide in the bushes.
When I said you were for the birds, I didn't think they'd hear me.
Oh, 'To Catch a Mockingbird', but it isn't like you think.
You must be new around here, the birds in this park demand at least 20% of every bagel.
I think you've been retweeted.
What kind of cologne is it?
Stop sending out Tweets.
Okay. Real quick, here's the end.
I told you not to tweet so much, Mr. President.
So what's it really like in Witness Protection?
There's no such thing as a "pigeon whisperer."
Dude, just twitch!
Talk about a chick magnet.
I know it's more secure than email, but this is what you get when someone hits "reply all."
I wish Hitchcock could see this.
I guess you were right about being pure-bread.
Oh, I don't have to be unattractive to the pigeons. I just have to be less attractive than you.
Avian Flu?
Ever thought about getting a cat?
Alcatraz, you say?
Open audition, Mr. Hitchcock?
Actually, I prefer Vertigo.
Have you thought about getting a cat?
Francis? Is that you?
So, you're a pigeon whisperer?
Ya know, I often wondered what that expression meant, when the pigeons come home to roost.
Yes, the book is more realistic than the movie.
Want to borrow my Audubon?
Rest in peace
I didn't know pigeons were birds of prey.
When they've finished eating, can I have your recipe?
Tuppence for your thoughts.
That's quite a bird call you have there.
So,... how's your lunch?
It says here that without regular exercise, your body will go to seed.
I understand the embarrassment, but I think you would we better hiding in the bushes.
It's no sin to discourage a mockingbird.
I told you bird seed clothes weren't like hemp clothes. You never wanna listen, dude...
Looks like you got a lot of tweets.
And how were you tarred?
"You say, you're from Alcatraz".
Yo, St. Francis, you gonna clean up after them?
Murmuration of Empty Nesters
It’s a problem with clothing made from hemp.
This is what happens when you send tweets all day.
I have a bird feeder at home.
You obviously have worms.
You should lay off the carbs
I tried to tell you to just feed them day old bread. No but you had to put peanut butter on it...
Did you get a picture of that accident between the glue and popcorn trucks?
Your white proso millet is clearly more than so-so.
Maybe they shouldn't have taken down the Jefferson Davis statue.
The tweeting has really gotten out of control.
Honestly, I'd say I'm more of a cat person.
This bench is all that's left of their original habitat....
I think there's a problem with the second act, Mr. Hitchcock.
Spicey, is that you buried under all those tweets?
Is this like goat yoga?
Next time bring a book...these birds hate books.
Life is like a box of--
''A 'bird in the hand' is one thing, but that is ridiculous!"
Are you finished with the sports section yet, St. Francis ?
Practicing bird calls can be tricky.
So how long did you know Tippi Hedren?
Next time throw the crumbs further.
It says here that pigeons are pack hunters. Did you know that?
They post those signs for a reason, Malcolm.
Whatever you're wearing must be 'for the birds'
Better landings than droppings
So this is the flocked suit you were talking about?
Maybe you should stop tweeting.
Son, this concludes the birds part, now let's talk about the bees.
I hear Hitchcock is making a movie out of this Daphne du Maurer story.
Excuse me. Do you happen to know what time it is?
You know, I'm just thinking that what ya' got there is worth about 40 in the bush.
I'm sorry I would help but I'm pretending I don't see you.
Been sitting there long?
Did you say you tweet a lot ?
I told you to stop tweeting so much.
I deleted my Twitter account.
Maybe in your case statuesque is not a euphemism .
Good morning, my fine-feathered friend!
Why yes, I do know of a good drycleaner in the neighborhood. Why do you ask?
Why do all the chicks flock to him?
Mr. President, you literally sent a bad tweet.
So I hear that you invented a version of catnip that works on birds.
Is that you Alfred ?
I used to eat my lunch in the park, too ... now I just read.
Bernie? Is that you?
And again, nice talking with you Mr. Redenbacher.
You feed the pigeons here often, do you?
So, you enjoyed St. Mark's.
Says here that birds are naturally attracted to hemp
It could be bird flu... Is it hard to swallow?
You're wife is gone.
Help, help, help!!! They think I have Hamilton tickets.
I warned you not to dress up like a cavalry officer.
Have you ever thought of not tweeting?
Maybe it's not the worst thing to be lower on the pecking order.
No, I don't think it makes you look fat.
What the hell are you reading?
Been out of Alcatraz long?
Your last tweet struck a nerve.
...and for that matter, I don't believe in global warming either.
The correct name for them is "rock dove."
Actually it's a kit. A kit of pigeons.
I used to wear hemp.
Alfred Hitchcock....is that you?
This happens whenever I'm on Twitter feed.
You should be more careful with your tweet.
No - I said 'flock off.'
I prefer to read tweets the old fashioned way.
I can't believe the aviary makes you bring your work home.
Spilled more maple syrup this morning?
I had the same problem when I wore my tweet suit
Wow it must suck to be a Gingerbread Man.
You have a Bay with Wirds
Is it itchy?
...and I thought I got picked on.
So nice to meet you, Ms. Hedren.
Actually, my favorite was Psycho.
Papageno?
Just to be clear: Are you telling me that you are 100% absolutely, positively sure, that the next bus stops at Capistrano?
That's exactly the reason I quit Twitter
So how does it feel to be a private citizen again, Mr. Comey?
...or you could just READ about them.
I think there's a better way to start a Twitter feed.
Still having problems with your twitter feed Bob?
You're trending.
I liked it better when you thought you were Spider Man.
Why don't you just hide behind a newspaper?
That's why I went gluten free.
It's by du Maurier.
You're just a chirp off the old block.
If you don't move around they think you're a statue.
Coast is clear, Jim.
For God's sake, just stop tweeting!!
:"Try sneezing"
You must be high up the pecking order.
You said you were a cat person.
Because I don't have birdseed all over my clothes.
My Tweets never get that many Likes...
Chick magnet.
We get it Gabe, you're a chick magnet.
Who are you wearing?
Do you still want me to renew your PETA membership?
This isn't the first time I've regretted my Tweets.
Any ideas for your next project, Mr. Hitchcock?
What do you think of the movement to remove historic statues?
You've got a little mustard.. No.... to your left..
YOU ARE DEFINITELY FOR THE BIRDS!!!
I told you that Chia suit was a bad idea!
You've finally gone to seed.
I think your endless tweeting has gone too far.
So, how's that taco?
Song of six pence, or pocket full of rye?
Well, you'd have time for books too if you gave up your Twitter feed.
Jesus. Now what's he tweeting?
That happened to me when I was reading ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’
Well, apart from the sesame seeds, how did you enjoy your bagel?
Your twitter account has a lot of followers.
You're not supposed to feed the birds.
That's why they're called lovebirds!
The recipe calls for 100 park pigeons. I only count 50.
At least you are not pigeon toed.
I tweeted you were Trump.
So what's this new tick control you were telling me about?
I use the guy at 72nd Street who will brush the crumbs off you for a dollar.
They don't take to everybody.
Watcha readin'?
So stop talking pigeon English!
I expect that will be your last dumb-ass tweet.
Kinda poetic, Alfred, don't you think ?
What's all the flap about?
I think they have a message for you.
I closed my twitter account.
You been sleeping in that silo again?
They like you.
I haven't seen this many tweets since Donald Trump's first week as President.
Are you an editor?
Having run out of bushes to hide in, Sean Spicer gets creative.
That's why I stopped doing bird calls.
I'm trying to read.
How is your pheromone therapy going?
Percy's 'chick magnet' scheme went horribly awry.
Yes, that's worth more than two in the bush.
What's that, like 50 in the bush?
So statuesque!
You're obviously at the top of the pecking order.
Do not feed the birds.
You certainly have a way with birds, Mr. Hitchcock.
Yes, I can recommend a good dry cleaner. Why?
Did you change your after shave?
Sean, Sean Spicer, is that you?
Excuse me, ma'am. Is that Comme des Garcons you're wearing with those sensible black shoes?
One is a symbol of peace, many of war.
Gesundheit.
Yes, that is a very impressive bird call!
I saw a bag of bird seeds. My ex-wife was coming this way. What else should I have done?
So you're a bird whisper?
I'd be careful about cutting back their feed...
Moisturizing with suet again?
I TOLD you not to use peanut-butter based sun block!
You must give me the name of your dry cleaners
They might not be stool pigeons, but they'll still blow your cover.
Want me to explain how crowd funding actually works?
How is that nut and berry diet working?
And what makes you such a big flocking deal?
I think you're taking this Hitchcock thing a bit too far.
I'm not sure playing dead is the way to go here.
Have you considered meeting your friend inside?
Mullet, NOT millet! The Times declared it summer of the mullet!
Not a good day for edible underwear
Does this mean you have a pre-existing condition?
You really need to stop hanging around those seedy nightclubs.
No, no - I said his name is Saeed.
That must have been a controversial tweet
Sure Tippi, I'd recognize you anywhere!
Now that you mention it, I am feeling a little peckish.
So, how's the new job at the fish market working out?
Interesting variation on the whole chia pet thing.
You are alive, aren't you?
Dammit, I'm trying read here!
I'm reading this great book by Alfred Hitchcock, have you heard of it?
You should be proud, most entrepreneurs never have a successful seeding round.
Forrest, close the box.
I told you that book is for the birds!
It says here, this is one of the possible effects of climate change.
Dammit, Henry, stop tweeting.
Yes, the park could use a few more statues.
I still support you. But ease up on the tweets.
When you prayed for a magnetic personality, how specific were you?
So how was it working for Hitchcock?
Tippi Hedron was really your grandmother?
It's hell, being Mr. Peanut.
I stopped attracting birds when I went gluten free.
You shouldn't have provoked them.
I bet you'd kill for a nice phone booth right about now.
I'm not sure if I should ask, but have you seen the Hitchcock movie ?
Actually, I recognised you from the picture in the dust jacket
I take it they liked your tweet?
Forrest, I know birdseed is cheap and healthy, but if you had a box of chocolates, maybe these damn birds would leave you alone!
I'm just saying it's a lot to go through for a thorough exfoliation.
So, how's your day going?
There may be some lingering resentment.
Morning tweet-storm?
Still shopping at Costco?
So is it the seed butter itself that's the sun block?
At least they're not bats.
I said rolled oats not roll in oats
Peanut cologne?
Says here it's not likely to be fatal, but some of the side effects sound nasty...
It's something to do with the pecking order.
I can totally relate. I'm a chick magnet.
I think you've spoiled them, Dad.
A feather for your thoughts!
I asked you three times to stop singing Free Bird.
Things going south for you too?
Mr. Hitchcock, so nice to meet you!
This neighborhood is really going to the birds.
I heard it's good luck if one poops on you.
What will it take to get you to stop tweeting?
A bird in the hand, is better than 75 eating you.
That's what you get for wearing a hemp seed jacket.
I was not aware you could receive your tweets hard copy.
So, Harry, what else is new?
Go flock yourself.
I'd say your patent pending your bird whistle is a good idea.
Do you mind? I'm trying to read.
At $1.99 I think that bird whistle was a steal.
It says they're Cedar Waxwings.
As I believe I noted before we left home, Eau de Croissant was not the ideal perfume choice.
I SO wish that would would happen whenever HE tweets...
That’s not how you get your wings.
I thought flocking was for Christmas trees.
You know I have you pigeonholed as a bird lover.
Well, I assumed it was because no one else voted for the bird sanctuary.
That's quite the magic trick!
Have you thought about getting a cat?
It says here sunblock with peanut oil offers an extra layer of protection.
Says here keep still or you'll spook them!
Didn't you just testify before Congress?
You're supposed to uh, throw the bread
Ok, here she comes. Just act like a tree.
You know Hal, I think that pheromone cologne you bought is for the birds.
Chick magnet.
Of course, everyone gets the title’s metaphor but they underestimate To Kill a Mockingbird’s literal potential.
So, when were you released from alcatraz?
You've gone to seed, Herb.
This cook book has a good recipe for pigeon pie.
They're just looking for seed money.
Of course, if they get desperate, they'll eat any old thing
What's the pecking order?
Perhaps it's the tweed.
Look at the bright side. It's your statuesque beauty that attracts them.
I guess your tweets have been answered.
They won't bother you if you don't give them tweets.
I guess three piece suet wasn't a typo.
Would you happen to have the time
Quick, wiggle your toes so they don't think you’re a statue!
You related to Tippi Hedren?
No, I never watched much Hitchcock. You?
I always knew you were a seedy character.
Birds of a feather stick together.
I shouldn't have called you "seedy..."
You were right, Tad, that flax seed oil works great as a natural sunscreen.
Can you tweet somewhere else?
That's what you get for acting like a nut"
I thought you were nuts, but this proves it.
Technically, you're still feeding them.
Have you got a pen?
You've been tweeting too much.
Tweeting again?
Sorry, performance art just seems weird.
That is why I stopped feeding them.
Did I tell you I have a rash?
This would make a great movie!
The sign said don't feed the birds.
I see Trump's awake.
This is why I'm not on Twitter.
I told you that Super Seed salad was a bad idea.
Poppins, is that you?!
I'm beginning to suspect fowl play.
I guess you really are going to seed.
I said: IT'S DIFFICULT TO CONCENTRATE WITH ALL THE CHIRPING!
There's this thing called a bird feeder.
You do look statuesque
Wow, when my sister said she married the 'Bird Whisperer,' I thought she was cuckoo ...
They must like your tweets.
Still hiding 'among' the pigeons, Mr. Spicer?
Thought of getting a cat?
I see that your twitter feed has a lot of followers.
It says here to act like a cat.
Well, I'd say your new bird call works.
Dad, stop tweeting.
I think your wolf-whistle needs work.
you call that a disguise! not discreet man...
You think l'm next?
It must be your new cologne.
Your laundry bill is how much?
You must be the bread winner in your family
Wow! Are those your peeps?
Birds of a feather, love designer leather.
My bad, that ring tone was the mating call.
Human Birdfeeder? Can't wait to see your Human Birdbath.
Gee, the birds flock to you Brits wherever you go. Must be the foreign accent.
Well, that's one way to pick up chicks.
This is supposed to be a No Tweeting bench.
Thank goodness those aren't crows or I'd have to call in a murder...
These are New York birds: They can sense people who make a lot of bread.
She told me get out, I was for the birds. What do you think?
I didn't believe you when you said you could do fifty different bir4d calls.
Here comes two more
Is that you, Jack Sparrow?
That's not quite what I had in mind when I wished I was irresistible.
I don't mean to draw any unwanted attention, Ms. Gaga, but I have to say- huge fan of your work.
You should cut down on the tweeting.
You never heard of it? It's a Hitchcock classic.
I'd say it's your statuesque appearance.
You must be a hot destination for some frequent flier program.
Your tweeting habit is consuming you.
Sorry, but Tippi Hedren did it better.
Just let it happen.
Trying a smaller airline?
To feed and to kill a mockingbird.
I told you to chew with your mouth closed!
Somehow they can always spot an ornithologist.
My book? It's called "Characters of Central Park." Supposed to be real people, but I've been here all morning and haven't seen a single freak.
You can't hide from your problems that way.
You've got some work to do before you're a chick magnet.
Shall I continue?
You ever read this?
I told you not to pull out your fidget spinner.
Is everything still satisfactual?
It doesn't seem like such a good idea anymore, does it?
So how was your time in Alcatraz?
Angel investors with seed capital. What did you expect?
Give a bird a crumb, you feed him for a day...Teach a bird to make bread...I think you can see where I'm going with this.
No, an asshole would have said "feeling peckish?" I merely commented "dovely day out."
Still feeling impeccable?
No, but I saw the movie.
Personally, I use DEET to keep off ticks.
My mom always said life was like a box of Dove's...chocolates.
Step 2: "Whistle a happy tune."
After all, they are the indigenous population.
I see that Trump's flights of fancy are rapidly adding up.
Do they come back every year?
I'm hoping your imitation of an eagle mating call isn't so good.
Oh...Wow..!!...is that how twitter works..??
They say you should never feed them.
Well, I'll be darned, birds of a feather do flock together.
He got the bird seed and peanut butter, but poor Marvin couldn't find a pinecone to save his life.
What a fuss over one hotdog!
It says here you are supposed to hold the food away from your body.
I warned you that you looked seedy today.
So you said you were looking for seed funding?
Good news is, you're not pigeon-toed.
Oh no! Here comes the cat lady!
Did you pack bread-on-bread for lunch again?
Can't you see I'm tryin' to read here? Why don't you just flock off?
That's a very inconspicuous bird suit Mr. Comey.
Posing for your statue, Mr. President?
now I'm interested - I'll follow your tweets
What was the name of that cologne again?
So how carried away did you get with this hemp seed diet?
I don't get fashion these days.
How's that St. Francis Eau de Cologne working out for you?
I know it's uncomfortable, Mr. Hitchcock, but maybe it'll give you an idea for another movie.
I wish I were popular.
You might want to consider tweeting less.
No, I am not a birder.
Do you call them a flock, a gaggle, a cluster or a covey?
do you need help?
That bird seed cologne is overwhelming.
Now it says to focus your attention on the point between your eye brows.
Me? I stick to lotion sun screens.
Fine! Ignore me!!
A small pair of hands is worth two terms of Bush
Never in the annals of ornithology ...
How do you get anything done with all that tweeting?
Maybe next time a small cup of seed would be better than bringing the ten pound bag!
It's why the 'caged' bird sings.
Honestly, when you mentioned feeling inspired by the Met Gala this year I assumed you were talking about philanthropy.
Yeah, that's why I never feed them.
I'd say you've got that bird call down.
If you're going to let yourself go to seed, you have to accept the consequences.
So, the Paleo diet has been going well?
Excuse me, Mr. Hitchcock, do you have the time?
So do you still think it isn't a book on bird hypnotism?
Sorry, but my reference source only states that "birds of a feather flock together." I can not find anything definitive for why, when, or where they flock together!
I told you it was SEER Sucker, not Seed-sucker...
You had them at tuppence.
Pigeons are the new black.
So, is this a Pentacostal thing?
Probably best not to eat crackers in the park.
What's eating you
Erlich et al. suggest that flocking behavior is uncommon in this species.
I think you've been pigeon-holed at your new job, Frank.
House sparrows, a couple of robins, several starlings but mostly pigeons.
I told you if you did not stop Tweeting you would have a following.
Says here they can smell high cholesterol from a mile away.
Psycho is my favorite.
Yes, but frankly, that's what the Flockr app is designed for.
How was Alcatraz?
It says here they sense generosity.
Check your retweet settings.
I know how it is. I was once in a boy band, myself.
How's that peanut butter based skin lotion working for you?
Dove skin care is so hot right now.
They heard you were the drummer for Flock of Seagulls
You smell like bread crumbs.
Nice suet. Where'd you get it?
Is it as bad as being hen pecked?
I've read about you.
Potato chips. You can't blame the birds if they want more than one.
Looks like there will soon be a statue of you in this park.
Pigeons? There are no pigeons. You're crazy. Fake news!
My pregnant wife is going through a nesting phase too.
Just tell 'em "flock off".
Like I said, you’re an emotional statue.
Would you go somewhere else, all that tweeting is driving me nuts!
So is it a sin to kill a mockingbird?
Isn't it wonderful how nature comes alive in the Spring?
I told you to stop tweeting.
Well you do sort of resemble a statue of a Civil War general.
Step 3: if you haven't already, remove suet from your pockets.
I actually preferred Duran Duran.
Have you considered adopting a cat....?
Tippi, is that you?
Your gravitational force is off the scale today.
Worth 72 in the bush
Oh no, Mr Bread!
So, Alfred, got any ideas for your next movie?
Do you have much trouble with squirrels?
Still trending on Twitter?
No, I prefer commercial sunscreen.
Let go of the bread!
I'm reading a book, what are you doing?
Personally, I prefer bathing.
You're up early, Mr. Worm!
How long have you been tweeting?
No, I don't agree that covering yourself with birdlime and breadcrumbs 'Blows St. Francis out of the water'.
You really should market that bird seed.
Ever thought about taking a break from tweeting?
Jim, I always thought your politics were for the birds.
Costs a bit more than a tuppence, eh?
I've heard of being pigeonholed, but this is ridiculous!
I prefer sunscreen.
Oh my. He' s got worms.
Its time you stopped calling this your performance-art piece.
Hasn't happened since I went gluten-free.
Ah, no thanks, I'm not hungry.
Do you have the time?
I said get the flock out of here...
No, I'm all right. Just don't make any sudden moves.
Looks like you are in a peck of trouble!
well, they are "of a feather"...
Didn't I tell you this would happen?
They say it's not a good idea to feed the birds
So, they heard about your Hamilton tickets?
Geez, Tom, you've really gone to seed.
Pardon me. May I find you a cat?
Sorry, I thought they had been baked into a pie.
Weren't you in that Hitchcock movie?
You never saw that Hitchcock film, did ya?
That's the trouble with meditating in the park.
Don't be so smug, I think the Hamilton statue is just as popular.
The salesperson said it would make me a real chick magnet.
Let me guess where you are in the pecking order.
To be seed and not heard.
You should have stopped tweeting when you had the chance.
You're actually not supposed to feed the birds.
By Jove, I too, am feeling a bit peckish!
You've totally gone to seed, man.
Would you and your pals mind moving to another bench? I'm trying to read.
Still need that tuppence?
They're pigeons. You dropped them some crumbs six months ago, they love you forever.
You are a real chick magnet.
This book has me all a flutter too.
Then she told me that she was a big Alfred Hitchcock fan, and I knew it'd never work out between us. His films are just too implausible!
Well, they aren't chicks, but you're certainly a magnet.
So how long have you been out of Alcatraz?
Just like me, they long to be close to you.
Did you know Alfred Hitchcock made a movie about bird 'Flash Mobs?'
No avian flu shot, huh?
You have a seed stuck in your teeth
Quick!! Get off Twitter, Mr. President!!!
I guess they finally caught up with the Gingerbread Man.
I'd say your tweet has gone viral.
Wait till they all have to go to the bathroom.
Now that ransomware has destroyed our phones, carrier pigeon is the only way to go.
Quite a chickadee magnet you are!
You might want to stop eating granola bars.
I always thought you looked very statuesque.
Have you considered what comes after the feeding?
Not to worry, they'll be migrating north in about two weeks.
Why not just give them the popcorn?
And just like that, Sean was gone and the interview was over.......
I hope you won't be tempted to feed the porcupines!
So you must be the Birdman of Gramercy Park.
You should really stop using that organic birdseed exfoliator.
Mitch?
So how long have you been out of Alcatraz?
Pardon me, but aren't you Tippi Hedren?
You must be made of dough.
Bird flu season, eh.
Not a bird in the sky today Fred.
You're supposed to throw the rice
I'd change my deodorant if I were you.
The next recommendation is to get a cat.
You say this happens every so often Mr. Capistrano?
It seems they find you statuesque.
Michael Keaton?
Wow, that was some birdcall.
I understand that it was half-price, but why would you even consider buying "suet-fragrance" body wash?
I'm sure glad I'm not a statute of a man sitting on a park bench.
Crumby outfit.
Relax, it's nonstop and they never overbook.
That's a lot of bird for tuppence a bag.
How long have you been a gargoyle?
Exfoliating with a loofah might be easier.
"No, I'm not really a Hitchcock fan. Why?
Whoa, you must have REALLY good luck.
You'd better hope they're all doves of peace.
Best skin exfoliation in town! Five more minutes of this and I come out looking 10 years younger.
I am very good at making cat sounds.
I agree, a suit made from popcorn did initially sound like a great idea.
Really? Tar and birdseed is humane?
It might interest you to know that I’m reading a biography of Alfred Hitchcock.
No offense, but this is the last time I sit next to a Gingerbread Man at the park.
I wish I had animal magnetism.
I guess it's mating season...huh?
You're taking "birds of a feather flock together" way too literally.
I told you I thought that was a seedy outfit.
I told you to go paleo.
Nevertheless, tuppence a bag is still an amazing deal.
So, when did you realize you had a special gift as an artist's model for statues?
This is why I'm gluten-free.
Good heavens -- just what have you been tweeting?
I told you you looked crumby
Excuse me, but you look familiar. Haven't I seen you on Fox News?
So much for a pecking order.
A little birdie told me you'd be here today.
Yes, you have clearance for takeoff. Safe travels.
Don't move. I've got a whole chapter of squab recipes here.
How's that hormone treatment going?
Quit complaining. You've always wanted to be a chic magnet.
I knew they looked a bit peckish.
I guess they heard you were having a crumby day.
I know we are what we eat, but still...
How do you like the city, Bread Man?
Lucky you. Allergies and sneezes that sound like a pigeon mating call.
Let me guess: you're Donald Trump incognito.
I heard feathers are in this season.
You aren't Tom Lehrer, by any chance?
You still need 25 more birds to beat the world record...
Will you please sit elsewhere, I'm trying to read.
Hitchcock fan?
Maybe this is why your clothes tend to have a white tinge.
Maybe if you just threw out the bread crumbs...
Your Twitter feed is all over the place today.
I see you've ceded your spot.
May the birds be with you.
I sure hope you're Hanks and not Hitchcock.
Okay, so the chapter on pigeon calls seems to have worked out nicely-- I think we should just jump to the chapter on cat calling now.
You would think, after six months, they'd realize she isn't coming back, God rest her generous soul.
I think your taking your job as a human statue a little too seriously.
So...that's one way to Tweet.
With hindsight, Kathy realized that wearing a shirt made out of bread was not the best idea she'd ever had.
I guess he really did say bird whisperer.
You win the Statue Challenge.
I think the ones that bring peace are a different sub-species.
How many tuppence did you have??
Sorry, I can't help you. I don't tweet.
Would you be offended if I told you to get the flock out?
Call what number, now?
Do you think your bag of popcorn has something to do with it?
You asked for a spell to make the pretty birds flock to you, didn't you?
Trump's tweets may actually kill you
Have you seen Tippi Hedren?
I'll carry on reading to you when you're not so busy.
Man, can you whistle!
Ummm...I just spotted a hawk!
I thought you were looking a little seedy.
Go find your own flocking bench
You're the one who wanted to be covered in peckers.
These no-frills airlines have finally gone too far.
Life is like a backyard,you never know what you'll get.
Jen, I think that yeast infection has spread.
That's what you get for having a crumby personality.
Have you considered cutting down on your seed consumption?
Sean, hiding in the bushes didn't work out well and I don't think this will either.
I guess business pivoted after you got that brain.
Now you know how I felt in my first marriage
You should have stuck with chocolate.
You've still got it, Tippi!
Perhaps scare-crowing is not your strong suit.
I take it you're a seasoned Hitchcock fan
you're a regular chick magnet
Flock you.
I told you not to wear such seedy clothes!
You may want to consider removing The Donald from your tweet list.
Henry, brace yourself, they are discussing the angle of take-off.
You might want to go easy on the tweets, buddy
See; being popular ISN'T everything!
No, I still have a landline.
Great camouflage Bill… Your wife will never find you here.
It is time to fill up your feeder!
Happy Birdday
For heaven's sake, stop tweeting.
What brand of cologne are you wearing?!!!
I'd be happy to bring my cat tomorrow.
If you didn't have such a seedy appearance, I don't think this would be happening.
It must be nice to be so loved.
You're lucky they only return once a year.
You've been reTweeted!
You overdid it with the pheromones.
I suggest you stop tweeting.
Did you see that Hitchcock movie?
Want me to call the cat?
Who knew you were that seedy?
Maybe you should wear a stuffed owl on your hat.
I suffer empty nest syndrome myself.
That's quite a whistle you've got there.
Didn't I warn you about Pidgin English?
You should've stuck with the worsted.
You are visiting from Alcatraz?
You do look a lot like the bronze statue over there.
R Crumb, I presume?
When you were younger you must have been a real chick magnet!
Tweeting is not really my thing.
All the coo kids are doing it.
Make sure you let everything dry before you flick it off.
I think it's time to put your whistle away.
I think your tweets have gone viral.
Be glad I am not reading Moby Dick.
It's about the Haves and the Have-Nots.
I guess you feel like home to the pigeons.
I warned you about buying your flax seed oil supplement from the online pharmacy in China.
It's none of my business, but you may want to go easy on the 'Eau de Birdseed.'
You wear TWEED, not SEED!
So, the ad said "meet me in the park in your nicest suet" and you didn't suspect there was a typo?
General, didn’t I just see you standing on a pedestal a couple of days ago?
Thanks for testing our prototype suits made from recycled corn. Still a few bugs to work out....
I don't think you're supposed to feed the birds.
Turns out you really are chopped liver!
Who do you like better, St. Francis or Alfred Hitchcock?
Tippi! ...Tippi Hendren. I thought that was you.
Pass me the sunflower seeds.
Maybe if you didn't coat yourself in peanut butter and bird seed.
You might try less Eau de Breadcrumb
Do you come to the park often?
Can you keep it down over there?
How do you keep the squirrels away?
Might you be that seedy character that I've been hearing about?
Can you do the same with mosquitos?
Why yes, I am reading Daphne du Maurier.
You might want to change your deodorant.
Have you heard of email?
I'm afraid "Bird Man" is already taken.
New aftershave?
Is that bread from the new place on the corner? I heard they were good.
But what exactly do you whisper?
'Sequels are for the birds, Mister Hitchcock.'
"Oh, you thought it was a 'Tweed' suit, not a 'Seed' suit.
I presume you missed the Hitchcock film..
How was the crumb cake?
Is it contagious?
I like your organic mode of transportation
Larry...when did I go from a babe magnet to a bird magnet?
This is the single greatest finch hunt of a politician in American history.
well, they are "of a feather"...
Well, it looks like you are at the top of the pecking order.
What happens when you sneeze?
How was Alcatraz?
It's all in your head.
Must be my new flax seed cologne.
I guess this place really is for the birds.
So how's that new Trump aftershave working for you then ?
Tippi Hedren, is that really you?
Your book must really be crumby.
Man, that's a lot to swallow.
Some of us go to seed faster than others.
You were right." According to world renowned ornathologists, park pigeons prefer stale white men over stale white bread.
Are you Mel Brooks?
Have you thought about a change in career?
Casting for a new movie, Mr. Hitchcock?
"Well if you will try and read "Wings of the Dove".
No, I did not say, 'Go flock yourself.'
That's the second time this week Ms Hedren.
You're welcome to borrow my copy of "To Kill a Mockingbird" any time.
I didn't like the movie either.
Feelin' cumby?
I don't do Twitter
Still working on bird pheromone synthesis I take it?
Who knew that your new underarm deodorant would also act as a powerful pigeon attractant.
Well, you must feel crumby.
Really??? You worked with Hitchcock?
That's exactly why I prefer books over social media.
Could you please keep them quiet. I'm trying to read.
Any second thoughts Mr. Pruitt?
You should see what I hey did to General Sherman
You were right! Females flock to a man who has bread.
Well you're still more of a chick magnet than I am.
What am I reading? The Birdman of Alcatraz.
And I always saw you as impeccable.
My understanding is it takes thousands of followers to be considered an influencer.
How's it going, Mr. Peanut?
But did you actually say no?
You shouldn’t have tweeted.
Nope, nothing in here about pigeons.....
I guess I misunderstood when you said the females flock to you.
I am reading the illustrated book of cats. Why do you ask?
Yes, I guess reading a book in a park is unusual these days.
Excessive tweeting attracts too many followers.
Stay still, I think you have a mosquito on you.
I'd steer clear of hemp clothing while in the park.
You're on their seat.
Hitchcock fan?
You must be nuts.
Can you keep it down? I'm trying to read.
See, most people don't know what birds really eat like.
I told you that you looked a little seedy.
I didn't initially see you as "seedy".
Are you certified as comfort person?
I told you 'Pigeon' by Ralph Lauren was a bad choice for the park.
Incessant tweeting.
BY ANY CHANCE, ARE YOU READING UPDIKE'S "PIDGEON FEATHERS"?
Mind if I smoke?
Wow! Aristophanes really comes to life on an e-reader.
Do you have the time?
They're not as much fun in real life.
It seemed romantic to use pigeon post for our wedding invitations, but I am not that thrilled about these R.S.V.P.s.
This just can't be real, I am reading The Birds...
You from Alcatraz?
My wife disapproves of our friendship. She says you're too seedy.
Do you have a good drycleaner?
I love your new tweet jacket.
By any chance, are you related to the muffin man?
Hey! Did you ever see that Hitchcock movie?
Alcatraz, you say?
Next time order the unseeded bagel
Maybe they just LIKE you, Ms. Hedren.
This is why I'm not on Twitter.
How's that grain based detergent working ?
Put down your book about Max the Stool Pigeon: they think it is about them
Perhaps a bit ...too much... hairspray?
So, how's that hemp clothing working out for you?
You're weird
This dating manual suggests your inconspicuous approach will not work!
Quick! Take a picture.
I too had a devoted flock... til I ran out of birdseed.
I'd ditch that aftershave if I was you
It’s a sin to kill a mockingbird. So I guess doves are no big deal.
So, Mr. Hitchcock, have you decided what your next film will be about?
I guess the rumor that Alfred Hitchcock was in town is really true.-
(in a "thought" balloon above the bird man) Put the book down and summon up your inner Heimlich. I've aspirated my bird call.
You feeling ok today? You look under the feather.
You might want to stand next to a statue.
Au Gratin or Paneto e Fritto?
I have a feeling you're that 'seedy character' the police have been looking for....
You're the epitome of seediness.
Wait for the drop!
Stroud, is that you?
Wow, you really have gone to seed
Those seeded bagels do make quite a mess, don't they?
Next time don't order the bagel with seeds.
Fran, where is this place Assisi you're from?
Are you live tweeting again?
Uh, Francis, is that you?
It says here doves don't actually cry.
Now that you mention it you do resemble Robert E. Lee.
Do you get the odd Cardinal
Excuse me, this is a 'no tweet' bench.
Your Twitter feed broken again?
Oh, sure. Now those feral cats may just have had their uses, y'think?
I told you composted clothing was a bad idea.
Alright, it's a scary movie...two words...first word 'The'....Hmmm.
No, I use Irish Spring, why?
You shouldn't have tweeted so much....
Could I try some of that bird seed?
Has anyone ever told you that you bear a striking resemblance to Tippi Hedren?
The sign says not to feed the birds.
I hear the in-hand bird market is strong right now.
Who says a dog is man's best friend?
Wow. Your latest tweet captured quite a following!
I would have enjoyed a bite of your muffin.
What are you using for bait?
What the peck?!
It says here that after years of research, scientists have no evidence that birds are changing their feeding habits due to climate change.
The guide says 'Don't!'
Three-piece suet?
Mama always said that life is like a box of bird poop.
Lose the shoes and you're a dead ringer for Tippi Hedren.
Never met anyone from Capistrano.
Eau de crouton, again?
Book says, breadcrumb pheromones?
No thanks. I don't like popcorn.
Somehow they found out that you strongly support Rights for Raptors.
"To Kill A Mockingbird" vs. "To Be Killed By Mockingbirds".
Could you keep it down? I'm trying to read.
So now do you believe you're statuesque?
At least they're not swallows!
I told you not to send that tweet
Didn't you see the movie?
"How ironic,I just started reading 'The Birdman of Alcatraz'.
I know a good dry cleaner.
Could I bother you for a moment?
It says 'a chip on your shoulder', not a 'chirp', Mr. Crumb.
Excuse me, but aren't you Tippi Hedren?
You are one chirpy person.
Maybe try being less seedy.
They're love birds.
That's why I avoid granola bars for breakfast.
Wow, that's weird. They normally never eat people.
Maybe you should lay off the bronzer.
Please do not feed the squirrels.
That's why I don't eat granola in public.
Need a lift?
What'd you tweet this time?
It says here, 'Alfred Hitchcock Syndrome.'
By any chance is your name "Capistrano?
Where exactly did you get that pheromone perfume?
It's about Avian Flu. A real interesting read.
Let me guess — tired and feathered?
That's exactly why I quit using millet aftershave.
You're very attractive.
Just hold still, they'll think you're a statue. On second thought, that's a terrible idea!!!
That suit of yours is for the birds.
This is not the place to sit if you're feeling a bit seedy.
Didn't you hate that movie?
You should stop Tweeting.
You've really got style... I could never wear shoes like yours and get away with it!
Sometimes you're the pigeon, sometimes you're the statue.
First time in New York, huh?
I blame Gluten.
Twitter tweets overkill #alternativefacts
Wow - this many must be worth Sean Spicer in the bushes!
Nice suet.
It says right here that this treatment for Ornithophobia will help you overcome your silly fear of birds.
Tippi? You in there?
This carries Tweets to a whole new level.
I've been to the zoo....I said, I've been to the zoo.
Have you thought about opening an e-mail account?
I wasn't very popular in high school. How about you?
It looks like the tweets are finally catching up with you.
Flock you.
So it's true what they say: birds of a feather flock to the 85th St. bench.
Are you going to offer me a piece too?
I heard you had gone to seed.
Just retired?
I thought you were only pigeon toed.
Gluten free, dude.
Could you lend me some seed money?
Excuse me sir, I am trying to read.
I guess they really do prefer the organic bird seed.
I warned you about salted popcorn.
It's best not to be reading Audubon magazine.
I apologize, you really are statuesque.
Don't nod off holding a bag of birdseed.
Jeff always knew Ted's stories were for the birds!
That new bugt repellent is really working
I told you to stop being so corny!
Too much of a good thing can raise Hell with your laundry.
This is the latest Angry Birds app?
Cheer up ... they could have been pigeons.
No, Smedley, this does not make them Passenger Pigeons.
And that's why I will never let myself go to seed.
That's the downside to being statuesque.
Come on. Now you’re just brooding.
I didn't know you spoke Pigeon-English.
Just be thankful they're only roosting
...and so that's why I deleted Twitter.
Are you wearing vel-crow?
They like your Vegan suit.
I am guessing you were in The Birds movie
You read it wrong, Henry. It says to wear a suit, not suet.
They smell the worm on you.
Maybe you should stop tweeting so much.
That's why I got off social media.
It's safe to come out now, Sean.
Sapsuckers are suckers for seersucker.
#tweetstormfail
When did you convert to Twitter?
If there's ever another pheromone incident in R&D it might be wise to take your lunch break in the lounge.
Told ya the disguise wouldn't work, Tippi.
Did I miss something? I thought a bird in the hand was worth two in a bush.
I told you to stop tweeting, Donald.
I told you it was a can of worms.
I used to have that problem.
I see your tweets have come home to roost.
I told you bread-scented sunblock was a terrible idea.
It says here you could be suffering from worms.
Are those birds of a different species flocking together?! Unimaginable! Why, if that happened in politics, Trump would never have lasted this long...
You're in deep doo-doo.
Keep them at 140 or less
Consider yourself totally flocked.
Guess I'm not a fixture yet.
I had that happen when I was reading To Kill a Mockingbird, too.
Some people have all the pluck.
Could you tell me, Mr. Hitchcock, where you get your movie ideas?
Noah, I warned you .
I thought you were a chick, not chickadee, magnet.
I hope you're not allergic to feathers.
You're tweeting, I'm facing this book - what are we missing??
I think you got that bird call perfected!
Yes, you're very popular Mr. President. Very, very, very popular.
Did you say three million Twitter followers?
When you said your new cologne was a "chick magnet" , I had no idea!
I heard that the bird is the word.
Shows that you're a pretty seedy character.
I told you to throw rice at the wedding, not birdseed!
Day 3: The birds are working. I've lured another mansplainer...
Do you have any bird food? I lost all mine.
Aren't you concerned about bird poop?
I would cut back on the organic body lotion.
Thus ends Poli Sci 101 - How your Government really functions.
I don't think PETA would approve of the design.
You must be posting a lot of tweets!
Do I detect a pleasant essence of thistle seed?
So, Mr. Peanut, still looking for a new job?
Christo's "Pigeon Magnet" in Central Park, New York City.
You really have a way with birds.
We're just flying in for a meeting.
I told you these were dangerous times to declare your sanctuary status.
You're not supposed to feed the birds.
Momma always said, sometimes - for no reason at all - you can get attacked by a whole lotta birds.
You'll regret it when they start to shed.
Your animal magnetism is showing
Is this a metaphor for "white flight"?
That's what you get when you wear seedy clothes
Are you made of bread or what?
It might be a 'Hitchcockian' thing...though anyone with caramel-licorice-buttered popcorn should expect such attention.
At least it was a cruelty-free tar and feathering.
What did you say, '...was for the birds?'
Feeling a bit peckish, are we?
You sure got a lot of birds on you.
You really should change your profile to private.
I knew that seedy outfit would get you the wrong kind of attention.
So... You said you like to feed the birds?...
Might I ask if you ever worked as a scarecrow?
Apparently the birds can't tell seedy, from seedy.
yo that one birds sucking your dick
I did not know Alfred Hitchcock's movie was real
I told you that after shave was sending the wrong signal.
So, Tippi Hedren is your grandmother?
I wouldm't use that body wash again.
You are the best "living statue", I've ever seen.
Have you thought about removing seeds from your diet?
Don't you think this place feels a lot like San Marco Square?
Prometheus had it worse.
Tell me you didn't just sneeze into a bag of sunflower seeds.
??? "Well if you weren't full of shit before, you are now."
Says here that a gluten-free diet can also prevent sudden pigeon attacks.
You still work at that bakery?
Well you did always want to trend in the Twittersphere.
Bye-bye bagel.
Alcatraz??
Hate it for you Toppens
But don't you think "Psycho" is the better film?
Ornithologically speaking they're the same as doves, if that helps!
The book doesn't mention if they're vegetarians.
I know exactly how you feel. Sometimes the world loves me, other times I'm being shit on.
I told you that book is for the birds!
I've had to substitute reading for tweeting while in the park.
The tweeters are sure following your three piece suet.
I had always wondered what a pigeon stool looked like....
Block that metaphor.
To Kill a Mockingbird?
PLEASE, do not feed the birds!
Henderson, I said you looked a bit seedy today.
I've always found you attractive, too.
How is that new organic sunscreen working out?
Might I ask what kind of bronzer you're using?
I might consider your invitation to attend the ball if I knew your sex.
You should know better than to wear such seedy clothes.
Guano tell me what's going on here?
You are only encouraging them.
Hemp shirt?
Your autobiography is quite compelling Mr. Hitchcock.
If you stop the constant tweeting they'll leave you alone.
I've got 64 in the bush...
This is what it sounds like when doves fly
Hey, do you mind? I'm trying to read and enjoy nature here.
Maybe you actually should start kicking her out of bed for eating crackers.
Let's try this one -- Hocus pocus magic words, fly away you hungry birds... No, not working.
Shut the flock up!
All this for a frog meme sub-tweet...
Sean, you know the bushes didn't work either!
It used to be seagulls, but my wife switched from Tide.
Crumby luck there Earl.
You must be pretty seedy
No, I said tweed not seed.
Obviously, you still feel crummy.
Wouldn't you know it says here those starlings are invasive and should be destroyed any time by any one using any means. Mind holding still?
They 'liked' my Tweet.
No, I can't say I mind being left No, I don't mind being ignored
Sorry this reminds of the time I fell into the bird pit at the pet store last week. It was terrifying and I'm a shell of the man I used to be please delete.
This is curious....you don't even begin to resemble Tippi Hedren....
It says here they can smell fear.
Congrats on your viral tweet.
Well it's official Mr. Capistrano, spring is here.
I can't wait to tell the kids I met Mr. Peanut.
I still liked your meat dress better
Looks like salted caramel pretzel is still it.
I'd always suspected those health bars were at least 50% bird seed.
To Kill a Mockingbird?
A suit made of stale bread? You may want to rethink your recycle/re-purpose aspirations
I think they're called hashtags.
Do you know Tippi Hedren?
Coverups usually ARE worse, Mr. President.
You must be real high in the pecking order!
For your next interview -- suit, with an i.
No, I don't tweet at all. Do you?
You still need a permit to rehearse for the sequel, sir!
You always could attract the birds.
Maybe you better stop shaving with peanut oil.
Did you say you were from Hartz Mountain?
I told you, your hair looked like a birds nest.
That you Alfred?
Good camouflage.
Actually, my suggestion was that you wear a 'suit' to attract 'chicks'.
Yes, they know the Muffin Man.
And I thought 'chick magnet' was just an expression.
You were just fabulous in Home Alone 2!
No, I would not like squab for dinner.
Hope your zipper's closed.
Trotting out the old Velcro suit again, eh Mr. Letterman?
Cute dog but I think it has worms.
Do me a favor and get the flock out of here!
I thought I smelled sesame.
Pre-Existing Condition?
Perhaps you should tweet less.
You OK there, Mr. Redenbacher?
Now I understand what you mean when you say that you have animal magnetism!
Wow! Cheep trick!
Birdemic
You're for the birds.
Just say together-flock-feather-a-of-birds 3x.
I take it you are from Alcatraz.
Sorry, I haven't got to the part about how to kill a mockingbird.
You've been sitting motionless too long.
Umm, I think you've got a little bit of something on your face.
So, you say you're from Alcatraz huh?
My mammy went to seed too.
They say "moderation in all things" is a good way to go.
Being top-seeded in your field is not all fun and games.
Bird flu?
I told you, pigeons always recognize one of their own.
A bird in the hand is better than . . . oh, never mind.
You overdid the retweeting.
You shouldn't have called me a cracker.
Are you whispering in Pidgin English?
By the way, how did that popcorn-scented sunscreen work out?
No, I can't help you go viral!
So Tilli, Alfred still pushing the "method" approach huh?
And he gave you how many pear trees?
You still live on Drury Lane?
How's that live tweeting working for you?
"Are you from Alcatraz"?
Jackson Pollock's eureka moment
What's the name of your next movie, Mr. Hitchcock?
Pardon my asking, but are you Tippi Hedren?
At least they're not vultures.
Do you have a problem raising seed money?
By chance, is your sunscreen the one made from birdseed oil?
You know, this form of pigeon pose could be hazardous to your health.
Let me guess. You're a big Hitchcock fan.
I warned you to stop mocking them.
I think the idea is to strew the seeds away from you.
Margie, I get it...they like you. Now, please come home.
Let's go back to using dead drops!
It gets a little seedy around here when the sun goes down.
Beak-a-boo? Are you in there?
THE BOOK SAYS YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO ACTUALLY THROW THE SEEDS. ON A POSITIVE NOTE, THE STATUE CLEANING CREW SAYS THANKS.
At this time of year they need body parts to build their nests.
You're right, birds of a feather do flock together.
Would you mind repeating that I didn't understand you the first time.
Maybe you should lay off the tweeting for a while??
Four and Twenty Pigeons
Life is like a box of bird seed....
I guess today you were the statue.
Cool! I always thought "Birds of a feather stick together" was just an aphorism.
I've been training them all summer to do that.
And that's another reason not to wear flax.
They're just feeling a might peckish.
I wish you would speak up I cant hear you!
Tippi, is that you?
Could it be the Dove soap?
Sure. All you want is anonymity.
Pardon me, what App is that?
How much peace can you endure?
Looks like a step up from henpecked.
Magic show auditions?
They love that new suit smell.
Tippi Hedren I presume??
So you assumed 'Three Piece Suet" was a typo?
I guess you really are feeling crummy.
Stool pigeon!
Has anyone ever told you that you look a lot like Tippi Hedren?
Beats depression, eh?
I think my oatmeal bath was a bit too concentrated....
More reading, less tweeting.
So, how was your spa day?
You gonna finish that?
The think it might be the 'everything bagel'
You twit, your tweets, their twitter.
Have you considered other ways to feel loved and appreciated?
I would have guessed from the East Side, not Central Park West
Would it be a birden to ask you for the time right now?
You have to be careful opening vacuum-sealed bags.
What is the President tweeting now?
I've never been to San Juan Capistrano, how was it?
Tippi Hedron, right?
No the book is called Catcher in the Rye. Not Catch Them with the Rye.
Flock of Seagulls? No. It's a flight of pigeons.
Please to meet you, Mr. Burpee.
I should have warned you that the new 3D version of Angry Birds is more realistic than ever.
Funny thing is that I'm just reading about crowd-sourcing.
I think they smell my bird
The secret is not to look like a bread crumb.
Do you work for Alfred Hitchcock?
Maybe it's time to rethink the whole,"make your own flax clothing", idea.
It's a book about facing one's fears and then eating them, by A. Hitchcock.
Mr Worm, I presume.
Wow, are those grackles? You know that Spring's in full force when the grackles start migrating.
Have any snacks? I'm feeling a bit peckish.
Eau de Capistrano?
@CartoonBenchGuy. You never heard of tweeting? Sad!
I thought you were a seedy character
Weren't you in Home Alone?
Sorry, I am fresh out of "Bird-B-Gone."
Have you tried that popcorn center cologne?
I told you not to wear Velcro when you feed the birds
I am sure this is not the meaning of giving the bird.
You okay if I Tweet this?
Wow! Y'all are real hungry today!
Fowl Landing
And that's why I just said this book stinks, instead...
Does it tickle, Mr. Breadstick?
Using sunflower seed bath soap again?
It's a new trend in skin care: sunflower cream! Want some?
says here they're called "Red Twitters"
Excuse me, can I borrow a pencil?
How was the Met Gala?
Oh dude!!! Are you new to New York?? They really, really like peanut butter!
I tried that sesame lotion once too.
Sure, I'll call 911 for you. Should I say you're being attacked by pigeons or attacked by doves?
You say your name is Francis?
The word around town is you're crackers!
They really do flock together
Do you find this book's language to be fowl?
Well you know what they say about birds of a fearher.
I had heard birds were the latest fashion trend.
Mind flocking together somewhere else?
You were right about not having to worry about squirrels.
Birds of a feather maul together
Try dried sunflower seeds instead of peanut butter next time.
It looks like they have just established a new pecking order.
If you keep still, they won't peck your eyes out.
Maybe we should get some lunch. You look a bit peckish.
Good book?
And all the time I thought it was water, food and shelter.
Crummy day eh?
Just wondering, was this on purpose?
Well, its better than a flock of seagulls.
You know, I've never met a bird's nest soup chef before.
Tippi?
Maybe you should be reading "Go Set A Watchman" instead.
Mr. Peanut, I presume?
who are you hiding from?
They seem to want to help you get your cat back.
He looked like a seedy character when he sat down.
You should read this book, "Baked Pigeon".
Ever consider deleting your twitter account?
That side of the bench is for the birds!
Ahhh...now I see what you meant when you bragged about having lots of Twitter followers
I'd say the market value is about 100 in the bush.
The swallows return to Captain Strano.
Last time you eat seeds at the park.
You're not really listening, are you?
Dare I say, birds of a feather ...
I like your seedsucker suit.
A definite downside to the birdseed diet, wouldn't you say?
Have you established a pecking order?
Are they all re-tweeting you?
Do you share recipes?
Have you considered unsubscribing?
Next time, I recommend calling yourself a whistle-blower instead of a stool pigeon.
Oh, Mr. Stroud, you're early today.
At last, the birds of a feather flocked together.
I see you've gone to seed.
Cat got your tongue?
You may want to forego those natural fiber clothing sales.
I understand you are the pigeon whisperer.
Here come the rats.
I heard you were a seedy character.
Have you considered getting a cat?
This is the reason I don't use Twitter.
If you don't mind me asking, who does your laundry?
I warned you not to whistle, yet, here we are.
Preparing for Birdman 2, Mr. Keaton?
I've started to go to seed myself
I never got Twitter.
At least they don't seem angry.
Is that you, Spicer?
I guess that bird whistle is authentic!
The Catcher in the Rye
And what do you do, Mr Hitchcock?
I heard they carry diseases.
It says here that pigeons will sometimes feast on the newly retired.
Yeah, I never really got into Twitter.
Your tweet must be trending ...
I warned you about wearing your seedsucker suit before Memorial Day!
Pardon me, but how do you expect me to concentrate with all that flapping going on?
It does look like a good basis for a film, Alfred, but are you sure you want to give it that sinister twist?
Nice tweet suit you have
I visited Assisi once.
I should have warned you; they have a rye sense of humor.
Are you ready for your trip to Venice?
They're here on a lark.
Learn from Trump: All the attention may feel good now, but eventually you'll be covered in bird poop.
I've never approved of all the flocking in this park.
If there's an outbreak of the avian flu, I'm avoiding you.
Are you a hashtag addict?
Nice suet you're wearing.
My cousin, Tippi, had the same problem.
How come you get all the attention?
Peanut Butter works every time.
Popcorn?
It's a decent start Alfred, but I really think the studio is going to want to see a script before they green light this thing.
Yep, the early worm attracts the birds.
I warned you about that all seed diet.
If they take you with them, I'll meet you at home.
Is it hard to get the stains out?
Do you come here often?
Does it hurt when you sneeze?
New shampoo?
Everywhere I go, I'm ignored.
Yes, I am reading Stroud’s Digest on the Diseases of Birds. When did you get out?
Mr. Spicer?
The same thing happened to me when I used that new all natural body wash.
Pooped? Me too.
You really are a chick magnet.
That's it, you've just got to find another bench.
Hey, Tippi! How's it going?
Holy shit!
Do you mind? That's three times I've started over with the same paragraph.
I told you that old hat looked like a nest.
What do you expect when you cover yourself with breadcrumbs?
This park is full of seedy characters.
Although rarely photographed, and almost always covered in Doves, the ghost of Prince is seen here enjoying a warm summer morning in Central Park.
I agree that you still are very attractive.
The gangs in the park aren't as scary as they used to be.
Tippi Hedren?
First the Pigeons, now the Doves...
Analog Tweetstorm
I always said those Tweets would be the ruin of you. Sad.
How long have you been known as The Bird Whisperer?
That's the problem with those vegan granola bars.
Yet another downside of monument removal.
I got off Twitter because it's such a time suck.
Who ruffled your feathers?
What did you expect, being the seedy character that you are?
"Hitchcock would have loved you".
George, I told you to finish that popcorn in the theater!
Nice costume, Jake, but will it fly?
And that's precisely why I no longer wear hemp fiber clothing.
It's amazing what a suet aftershave can do!
Sorry, did you say "whisperer" or "whistler"?
I'm feeling somewhat crummy myself.
Have you tried cutting out gluten?
Please don't be fed to the pigeons.
I told you that leisure suit made you look seedy!
I find that if you have a buzz cut they are less interested.
I loved you in Home Alone
Nice story Mr Hitchcock!
That was an unusually long nap.
Seedsucker?
You have the most birdies of any golfer I know.
That's not bad. Now let's try it with squirrels.
You're sitting in their spot...
What? I saw it on the cover of Vogue
You must be the baker.
Migratory and Twitter patterns have changed.
This park has gotten a really seedy element, lately.
Perhaps you should lay off peanuts for a while!
Bob, I don't think the birds are pleased you ate the canary.
That's not the best way to feather your nest.
Come on, Bill. Did you eat bird food today?
I took you for a seedy sort!
So your're pretty happy with your suet suit?
You shouldn't have eaten eggs for breakfast.
I don't think you're using the law of attraction right...
Why yes, tuppence a bag is quite a bargain.
Birds as a bush are worth more than two on your head.
Shouldn't you be sitting on a stool?
Birds of a feather flock to leather.
You've really perfected that worm impersonation
They will never believe it was "fowl" play .
Maybe #halfwitvoter wasn't a good choice?
I warned you not to wear that bird seed suit.
You knew they flocked together the moment you identified what kinds of birds they are.
The squirrels did the same thing to me last week - its a kind of animal flash mob.
That's why I stopped buying clothes made of hemp.
How are today, Mr. Hitchcock?
I said, 'You look dovely'.
You're a saint, Francis.
It says they will leave at the end of the summer Mr. Capistrano.
Don't encourage them.
So you are wearing your cote of coves, Jack?
Gone to seed?
To defeat the birds, you must become the birds
My mama always said that someday I'd meet a guy whose life was like a bag of birdseed.
Let me save you guys the trouble. He tastes like chicken.
You should think of leasing more space
You must know a lot of secrets.
I definitely do not want to have, what you have.
Mr. Peanut, I really think that you had better go inside.
I just knew you were a seedy character.
Twitter 1.0 used carrier pigeons.
You won't have to splurge on a down jacket anymore.
Oh, so you're the one who broke the pigeon lady's heart.
Apparently you missed the sign about feeding the birds......
My wife had the same problem.
So you're the one he's attacking on Twitter today?
I take it the bird-calling worked?
I don't think it's the Aqua Velva.
What did I tell you? Isn't this better than playing Angry Birds on your phone?
I knew it, Mom and even the birds like you best.
You must be the guy with the Comey memos and the Russian tapes.
Honestly, reading a musty copy of 'The Art of the Deal' seems to repel them quite naturally!
An artistic conceptualization of gentrification, or perhaps an artistic conceptualization of addiction, or perhaps over-population. What else could it mean?
Well, if you were not such a messy eater.....
These benches are for the birds.
They probably smell your pigeons.
It says right here on page 71 of the instruction manual: "Do not wear garments fabricated from birdseed cloth outdoors."
Impressive. But is there a really a market for a pigeon caller?
Channelling St. Francis of Assisi is not as easy as you thought, eh?
I don't think it will help even if they are mockingbirds.
That's funny- you don't look like Tippi Hedren.
Why do birds suddenly appear. . .?
That is absolutely the worst Tippi Hedren impression I've ever seen!
Are you, by chance, from Alcatraz?
well, this is something you don't see everyday.
We had a deal!
You're trendy now, but I hear there's a new park bench opening in Brooklyn tomorrow.
If you must know, I'm reading the screenplay for a new Alfred Hitchcock movie.
Roses are red and violets are blue, why are those birds landing on you?
How long does it take to wash of all the bird poop?
I got off easy. Feathers, no tar.
Just try not to open your mouth.
Peace.
Try using fewer peanuts.
Yeah, my eco-suit is a little too friendly.
Let me guess, Bodega Bay
It says here for man your weight, you will need at least 30 of them to fly.
So what am I, chopped liver?
It says here if you hold real still, they won't poop on you.
Grainola for breakfast again.
Life is like a flock of pigeons.
So you say you were the inspiration for the movie Birdman?
Agent Gingerbread?
You the Bird Man of Central Park?
Oh, so you think the popular vote matters?
We'd better switch to decaf.
I'm rather hesitant to flip to the next chapter about Psycho.
You always struck me as a seedy character.
Maybe you should just stick to a box of chocolates.
Luckily I'm allergic to peanuts.
spicey is that you???!
It's possible that your most recent tweet had unintended consequences, Mr. President.
Ever considered wearing a simple wool jacket instead of a seasoned breadcrumb coating?
"So your first movie roles was in Hitchcock's "The Birds".
Stupid me, reading Hitchcock out loud
A Bird's-guy view
That must have cost a lot of dough.
You know where I can get a hanging version of you for my patio?
You’re definitely going to have to burn that outfit.
I prefer American Eagle.
by any chance do you have the time?
I never thought of you being that seedy.'
Did you say a suet suit or a sweat suit?
The Inventor of Twitter
I told you to stop reading that biography of Saint Francis.
Sure you might be at the bottom of the pecking order now, but you'll work your way up.
You know, you can disable that messaging option.
So you say you're from Capistrano?
No, I don't think you should worry about ruffling a few feathers.
That reminds me. There's an Alfred Hitchcock film festival tonight
Lady bird is that you?
That's why I don't tweet.
I told you not to let yourself go to seed, Gerald.
No wonder your nickname is Gregory Peck!
I can't put my finger on it, but there's something about you.
What do you mean you feel like you've gone to seed?
"Don't say Hitchcock didn't warn you.
You are covered with birds.
No thanks. I have a budgie.
Wow, birds of a feather really do flock together.
If you don't mind me saying, I think a trick to that "human statue" thingy might be to actually move every once in a while.
Any ideas on what your new film is going to be about, Mr Hitchcock?
That's why I don't read Robert Crumb outdoors anymore.
Okay, it works, but did you focus-group the idea?
I did recommend the plain bagel.
Tippi? Tippi Hedren? Is it really you?
I knew you looked seedy.
You really need a smartphone.
So what am I, chopped liver?
Your wife said she left you because of a chick.
We can't keep meeting like this
That's not what I meant when I suggested you Tweet more often.
Hey Mike... on second thought, I would like to share half of your sand..wich uh.. never mind.
Peace be with you.
They're so shallow---they only visit when you bring food.
No offense, but that suit is rather seedy.
I'm guessing you used that new sesame seed sunscreen.
Got any crackers?
I'm reading "Jonathan Livingstone Seagull", what're you reading?
What were you reading?
Did you see that Hitchcock movie?
Vulgar man who spits his seeds everywhere, I would like you to meet karma. Karma; seed-man.
Another drawback of the worm suit.
" I must say, Enough is Enough. Way to many TWEETS...
Is that the new Prozac?
Told you so.
I never got the hang of 'Tweeting' either ...
That's why I always bring a book.
Just be glad the geese haven't found you.
I said "A bird in the hand", Brian.
I'm learning how to do that too
Your cologne is for the birds!
Well they do say that "some days your the pigeon and other days you're the statue..."
Hey Hitch, what was that about an idea for a new movie?
What do you want for lunch? I'm feeling a bit peckish.
Do you work in a peanut factory?
Then why did you wear your three-piece suet?
It's gonna be pretty hard to remove you from this flight.
How do you get the bird seed to stick?
Maybe you should read a different book.
Steve? Steve Suet? is that you?
Ready for lunch? You're looking a little peckish."
And that's when life became stranger than fiction.
Tired and feathered
Statuesque?
How do you come up with your ideas for movies, Mr. Hitchcock?
You make St. Francis look like a piker.
I've heard of a idea being for the birds, but never a person.
Those flax seed linen suits are really all the rage this year aren't they?
I get it. It's a gag. I've always thought 'The Birds' was a gag, too.
Apparently you weren't kidding when you said you'd gone to seed since retirement.
Actually, it's my second attempt at understanding "Animal Farm". Haven't read it since 6th grade.
I am pleased to make your acquaintance Herr Bagelmann.
Can you spot me tuppence?
Terms of Adornment
No, I mean what do you do for a living?
Bad throw.
You're lucky the squirrels haven't found you yet.
I hope you're making a movie.
It all started when I was in Alcatraz.
You know, when you decide to wear hemp, you should make sure all of the seeds are out of it first.
I'm no expert, but I'm guessing there's an easier way to Tweet.
You should have never supported that Confederate statue.
Could it be your chia seed diet?
President Trump, I warned you about the excessive tweets. You have followers!
I told you it was time for you to clean out your closet.
You've really gone to seed lately.
Spilled your Mac Shake again, eh?
How cheep can you get?
Maybe you should tweet less.
A Hitchcock fan, are you?
Don't whistle a second verse.
Your empty nester days will be here before you know it
Well, I guess this bench is for the birds!
It's a Northern Pileated People Plover.
It's called To Kill A Mockingbird, I'll you read it when I'am done.
You can’t call it birdwatching if you cover yourself in peanut butter, Phil.
Blah, blah, blah, seed funding, blah, blah.
Did I hear you say that you are "Audubon Person of the Year"?
Pipe down over there. You're tweeting almost as much as the president.
Feeling peckish?
It might be time to scale back on the bird-watching.
Maybe you should delete that tweet.
Hitchock's my name. Film's my game.
You should get your hormones checked.
Jeepers..And I though the last guy with the box of chocolates was a bit off
You must be in the birds'-eye view.
Well, what are you wearing?
So what do you do at the magician's school?
Texting is cleaner than carrier pigeon!
Oh, I see the swallows have returned from Capistrano.
You say it's called "Early Bird Worm" seed?
Your ability might come in handy after the apocalypse.
I see Lyft is trying a new business model.
Really? I was not aware that carrier pigeon was a Twitter feed option.
Seems like your strategy for using your smartphone a little less is really working for you.
Guess you shouldn't have sent that last tweet.
Well, I guess peanut butter for body lotion wasn't such a great idea after all!
The Gingerbread Man goes to the park
Yeah, they probably smell my cat on me.
Say, that reminds me. Are you a Hitchcock fan?
:Well, at least it's kind of like having a statue erected in your honor."
I always knew you were nuts.
New suet suit?
Did you just send me a tweet ?
People say he's a crumb, but WE love him.
I've started eating lunch inside...
Will you please stop the tweeting?
I told you spreading peanut butter would work.
Because of the rise of people being stingier with their food handouts, the local pigeon population have developed a taste for human flesh
I always wanted to know the Muffin Man
You can't use Twitter in this park.
They say they're the Vienna Birds' Choir?
How's that Hitchcock biography?
Figured that. My favorite was "The 39 Steps".
Being less attractive has finally paid off for me, pretty boy.
Quite the chickadee-magnet , aren't we?
Look, you chose the robin egg suit.
Hey man, any chance you can spare some bread?
It says here to hold still.
But Jeff, you said I should be more lovey dovey.
Didn't you see the don't feed the birds sign?
Could be time to cut down on the gluten.
If you put the book down, you'll get just as many retweets.
I never get any attention.
The book says explorers first called it La Isla de los Alcatraces,” from the archaic Spanish alcatraz, a word which was borrowed originally from Arabic: al-qa?ras, meaning sea eagle. When did you say you got out?
The same thing happened when I left my chia seed pet on the windowsill.
Is this normal in Oregon?
You must have never heard Tom Lehrer's song.
You aren't an acorn, sunflower seed or peanut are you?
Told you not to bring in the feed near the chapel, these wedding doves are starved for days before the "I do". Says they keep more alert, fly faster, and will completely clean the rice from the ground.
I don't get as many retweets.
I told you this was a bad place to try the mannequin challenge.
Today is for the birds.
Twitter has ruined my life.
They sure ain't love birds!
Tell me again...which one's Percival?
When you were telling me that your life has gone to the birds, I didn't think you really meant it.
Same thing happens every week. Thursdays. 9:30 AM. Always *that* side of the bench. Don't take it personally.
I warned you, Pepys just attracts them.
Just hope they aren’t carrier pigeons
It says here it's your animal magnetism.
No I didn't. But I rather enjoyed Vertigo.
You should stop whispering.
Perhaps you shouldn't coo when holding cashews.
I'm sure the allegory of the cave has something to say about this.
That's why we don't discuss Mike Tyson around here
Were you ever in Alcatraz?
I told you to cut gluten out of your diet for a reason.
Too many tuppence?
'Theres two more coming can you make space?'
'They just like you because you have bread'
I thought the Met Gala was last week.
Well at least it's good weather for it.
I told you YouTube fragrance review is a prank.
No Ralph, I am pretty sure your new cologne smells like Doritos.
The sign says not to feed the birds.
You must've misheard me. I said lox and bagel.
Told you tweeting was dangerous!
Birds of a feather flock...
I guess I'm glad I chose the suede over the suet.
You must be in rich in the bush.
Can you get off the ground in that thing?
You forgot your safe word again, didn't you Carl?
Don't you think this twitter thing has gotten the better of you?
I told you not to walk through the seedy part of town.
You're so statuesque.
Well, this is one instance where I would've taken the capital gains...AND spelled crowd correctly.
I bet that suit costs a lot of bread.
Have you tried the Audobon Society?
That is a crummy jacket
If its any consolation ... I don't find you "that" seedy.
I see you've tried that new all natural sunflower detergent.
I don't think Birdnip is going to catch on.
Tuesday.
You picked a bad day to wear your new hemp suit!
Me? I'm reading 'The Birdman Of Alcatraz".
Are you Alfred Hitchcock?
They love chocolates from the box.
Would you please move I can't concentrate.
Have you tried going gluten free?
You are SO flocked.
Tippi, do you take all your roles this seriously?
It was 50% off.
You should stop wearing those crummy cloths.
Now might be a good time to learn some pigeon English.
Pepperidge Farm?
Perhaps you should stop tweeting.
You must be related to Walter Pidgeon
Shitlist Protection Program, Mr. Comey? Don't worry, I can keep a secret
I can't read those crumby books any more.
Seediness is going to be your downfall.
So, how are the sunflower seeds?
Mr. Hitchcock?
Did you remember to bring crackers?
I miss Hitchcock too!
Sorry, Harry, I didn't recognize you for a second.
Yes, your suit does have very nice flocking.
It fits you well. Really!
Did you reply to all?
Have you considered upgrading to electronic homing pigeons?
Maybe your tailor thought you said seed instead of tweed.
Ease up on Hitchcock.
I told you you've been spending too much time at Subway.
You seem to being carrying quite a bird-en.
I think your nutritionist oversold you on the flax seed thing, Bill.
I thought you were looking a little seedy.
Axe body spray?
I hope your bird call is still in beta.
You still think pheromone cologne is a good idea?
Do all CIA agents have as subtle disguises as you do?
So you're a pigeon stool.
Your chick magnet fragrance needs some tuning.
Gross!
I stand real still for hours, pretending to be a statute of the president, but right now I'm on my break.
Okay, Jim, now before we go through with this I have to ask - are you a stool pigeon?
Cut all the tweeting and read a damn book!
It may be time to cut back on your tweets.
Just tell them to flock off
Looks like someone poured glue in the birdbath again.
My mom always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're going to get.
You may have gone to seed.
It was 1963, Bodega Bay...
I suppose that's what they mean by 'shitstorm'!
That's why socialism never works.
I've never been mistaken for a bookworm.
Yes your flaxseed jumpsuit is trendy, but....
I always said you were a chick magnet.
I'm sorry it bothers you when I turn a page.
What do you feed them?
I'm reading, "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest".
I guess you are a chick magnet.
Hitchcock phoned and said Tippi will be right over.
They heard you work at the E.P.A.
So what's coo?
You're a little early for Fashion Week.
Lady Gaga, I dont' think that the popcorn suit was such a great idea
I see. I had something else in mind when you were bragging about your tweets.
Wish I had your knack for bird calls.
I hope those peanuts were organic
You must have a huge dry cleaning bill.
Alfred Hitchcock I presume?
That had to have cost more than tuppence.
Been a birder long?
I don't really get street theater, but, yeah, I liked Birdman too
I wouldn't sit there. It's covered in bird poop.
Is this some realistic version of Park Bench?
Never liked you birdwatchers.
I told you not to wear that perfume.
Your tweets are so annoying.
Wanna hear another chapter?
Maybe you should go gluten-free.
So many birds, so little time
It says your symptoms are Bird Flu.
Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates
Nice bird suet.
I told you they smelled fear.
I'm pretty sure they recommmend wearing a SUIT to an interview, not SUET.
I'm done using sunflower seed oil as skin moisturizer.
I picked up a lot of birdies on the back-nine over the last week.
This must be new Marvel character I've been hearing about.
I told you that bread suit was gauche.
There was a corpse here last week
'Psycho'? No, wait. That was the one with the girl in the shower.
I don't get any affection at home.
That's why you are not supposed to feed the birds.
I know how it feels, I used to be the BREADWINNER.
I was just about to say how statuesque you look.
Say, have you ever read the screenplay for Hitchcock's, "The Birds"?
You must be the Gingerbread Man.
Nope, I don't see any press.
The city has been warning us aboout seed characters hanging out on park benches, but I guess you know about that...
That's why I don't wear perfume any more.
Wow, they're are awfully peckish today.
You might want to brush the breadcrumbs off you when you eat your sandwich.
Will you never learn to share?
I think your popcorn buttons are problematic.
Are you all right, Mr. Hitchcock?
Your bird calls really send a message!
Love your book, Mr. Audobon
Positively Hitchcockian.
Great idea, Mr. President. No one would expect the 'Birdman of Alcatraz' defense.
You're just begging for twitter commentary.
You think that you've got enough bird seed there, Butch?
I have a Tom Lehrer song on my I-Pod which you might find helpful."
Sir, the Special Counsel has been appointed, and you can't hide behind tweets forever.
you are undocumented?
If only I was tastier.
Maybe you should dial down your animal magnetism!
That's why I stopped packing peanut butter sandwiches for lunch
I'm wondering mate if that bloody wizard might not have been British after all.
And then Miss Poppins said...
Did I mention, I hate free range pigeons!
Looks to me like you're flocked
Mr Trump, I think carrier pigeons may be immigrants.
Anything for attention.
Crumbs, now that name makes sense!
I wouldn't pigeon hole you like that.
Your suit will go well with whatever perfume you're wearing
"You are the bread of their eye".
I take it you're a regular here?
Michael Keaton?
No, Mr Hitchcock, I don't have the time.
I'm not sure you've really understood the key principles of camouflage
you've gotta real good whistle there buddy.
I loved you in Mary Poppins.
They have lint rollers as low as $1.99 at IKEA.
The bird-seed suit was a bad idea, I see
It can be a burden to have a lot of dough, huh?
That's why I gave up Twitter.
You must be feeding them gluten free grain.
These Hitchcock stories are quite something.
Its becuase your clothes look so seedy.
Is your name Patsy, by chance?
Entry #1: I can give you the name of a good dry cleaner on East 73rd. Entry #2: Too much tweeting, eh Mr. President?
I'm pretty sure you're tweeting wrong
I told you looking too statuesque would get you into trouble.
Any relation to the Bird Man of Alcatraz?
To be honest, I still think people will notice you.
Yet another reason the book is better than the movie.
You're right, they clearly show a preference for the gluten-free!
...another chapter in the weaponizing of everything.
It says here they are attracted to seedy sorts who spend inordinate amounts of time on park benches and it's incurable.
I told you that suit looked seedy.
Did you not realize that the bird whistle holds the force?
So you're looking for seed money?
Really? I, for one, love Hitchcock!
This time you're really flocked!
Why can't you just let it go?
I loved Rear Window. Which Hitchcock movie was your favorite?
Recycling?
Tweeting in the park is not a good idea.
This is why I don't eat bread.
Maybe if you changed your last name from "Capistrano"?
That's why I stopped ordering the everything bagel
Well, at least they're not buzzards.
I bet it tastes like chicken.
Congressman, there are a few things I'd like to discuss with you
Immolation by birds - is that a new Occupy Park Bench protest strategy.
So, what's all the " flap" about?
Next time, wash off all the bagel seeds before you come here.
It looks like you've been flocked!
I told you this park is seedy.
So feathers are the new fur?
Excuse me. Where do I find the Gingerbread Man?
That's enough seven seed bread.
I TOLD YOU YOU'RE LOOKING SEEDY..
I told you that you had a crummy personality.
I told you not to eat a whole bag of popcorn.
Tweet storm?
Are you a seedy character?
So, is this your worst nightmare, Mr. Hitchcock?
I'm having flashbacks of a terrifying Alfred Hitchcock movie I once saw.
Love birds I presume.
You're taking this 'birds of a feather' thing just a bit too seriously, Hank!
There seems to be a mutual attraction.
I'd cut back on tweeting.
Psh. What a pizza face.
My brother has a dry cleaning business, and by the way St Francis never used seeds.
There's a great laundromat around the corner that can get rid of those crumbs.
Did you read the warning on the Eco Clothing fabric?
You clearly went too far with that last tweet!
That's another disadvantage of those biodegradable books that nobody talks about.
At least you can't say they don't like you!
"Miss Hedren, I think you have something on your shoe".
Actually, it's The Peterson Field Guide to Eastern Birds
You are bread inside.
Was it like this in Alcatraz, too?
Looks like you're the statue and the pigeon.
Oh they match your shirt!
Why do birds suddenly appear Every time you are near? Just like me, they long to be Close to you
No I'm sorry I don't have a handkerchief.
Lucky I wasn’t reading what that guy was reading.
May I suggest Instagram, Mr. President.
Have you seen the latest Hitchcock movie?
Careless tweeting can have consequences.
I see you bought your suet at Barney's.
You might want to rethink the bread crumb body wash.
Why don't you give up those crummy books?
It appears that you have gone to seed.
Birdwatching?
So, is this your first slime in New York?
I thought you were just being dramatic when you said you were going to seed.
You should have taken Jim Lehrer's advice.
The Twitter Manual says you should delete your account, Mr. President.
Does your wife Robin know about this?
I've heard of seedy personalities, but this is absurd
I wish my Twitter feed was that popular.
I warned you about wearing that silly feather hat.
The book is better than the movie.
Maybe you should try changing your after shave lotion.
Try not to dwell on the negative side of being statuesque.
Covering yourself with suet is not the same as a bird landing on your podium.
You know, I have a similar problem -- only with mosquitoes.
What's the pecking order?
I guess you're glad that cows don't fly.
I used to share a bench with a guy covered in parakeets. Yeah, you heard me right, parakeets.
So, is this your first trip to Bodega Bay?
Darn, why didn't I cover myself with birdseed!
Are you waiting for Godot?
Hmmm. I guess that new bird seed-scented laundry detergent really is a thing!
I too thought you looked seedy.
I can't seem to find any instructions in English.
As I told you. That aftershave lotion is for the birds.
Johnny Appleseed?
The day the gingerbread man learned not to go to the park
You have to stop tweeting so much.
I'm a bit of a bird-lover too, but unlike yours, mine is a story of unrequited love.
Just another seedy character at the park.
Have you considered a gluten-free diet?
Sewing the seeds of your own destruction into your clothing is always, always, a bad idea.
That you Alfred?
Give 'em an inch, they'll take a mile.
You want me to call Mrs. Peanut?
You don't have feathers, you are not a bird. You're flocked.
I always suspected you were a bit seedy.
I told you not to order the seeded bagel.
They dove in unexpectedly
Upon reflection ... popcorn scented body spray might not have been the best idea.
Did you forget your 'safe word'?
I think your breadcrumb bodywash is the problem.
Maybe you should try a low carb diet
Wearing your summer suet now?
I think you got a little something on your jacket.
Funny you should ask, I'm reading 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest.'
Excuse me, I think a feather landed on you.
Feed the birds here often?
Did you hear they are producing a remake of Hitchcock's movie "The Birds" ?
If I hadn't seeded it myself, I wouldn't have believed it!
Word has spread you are offering a gluten-free alternative.
'Can I suggest 5 Things to Watch For When Feeding Birds' ?
Good to see you. Last I saw you was at Alcatraz!
Oh Shoot! ...There's no mention here how to cancel a bird call.
Cheever's Falconer. What are you reading?
They're attracted to your edible underwear.
You are covered in tweets.
Last time I buy Gerbal Essences shampoo.
The book is better.
Does this mean I get Rear Window?
I thought you were gluten free.
How long have you been pigeon stool?
I just hope the bird of paradise does not fly up your nose.
No wonder you know everything.
I told you to go easy on the buttery popcorn cologne!
"Holy pigeon poop"!
There has to be a better way to meet Mike Tyson.
There are still a few problems with that peanut-based fabric.
That animal magnetism won't last forever, you know.
Hope is a thing with feathers !!
The compost friendly honey suit might have been a mistake.
Big deal. I was someone's turtle dove once, too.
I told you not to buy sunscreen made with peanut oil.
Have you considered adjusting your gluten intake?
I had no idea you did bird calls.
Please stay still while I look-up each species.
You look like Orville Redenbacher, that's why.
Ah......a bird whisperer.
Well, 'Flock' to you too!
Is that you, Tippi?
The promise to 'attract more birds' is more literal here than in Britain.
You said you are a descendent of St. Francis?
Is that the new Hitchcock biography?
FYI, your You Tube video - "The Birds - Part II" has made the most viewed list.
On page 63, It says you need to cut back on your consumption of peanuts!
So there IS downside to being Mr. Peanut.
I guess seeding is believing!?
You look crumby...
Do you Tweet?
It's my environmentally friendly T-shirt.
Did you see the latest tweets?
I warned you about that bug repellent.
Hitchcock, Alfred Hitchcock.
I see you're learning the pecking order.
There may be a downside to "Briciole De Pane" designer clothing
It's the flaxseed in your vegan sunscreen.
Life is like a box of chocolates. You just have to remember not to leave it open.
When do you feed the squirrels?
Well , your suit is somewhat seedy.
I warned you not to get in a Twitter war with Trump.
See, " I told you it was a "seedy" looking suit"!!
I guess you have reserved seed-ing.
Just be happy they're not buzzards.
It says here "Try changing your seedy clothes."
Did you say your name was Audubon?
Is that suet after shave lotion you have on?
What was that about a box of chocolates?
Maybe building a wall would help.
Holy shit!
I see you're busy at moment, sir, but do you have the time?
i hate it when he tweets via pigeon post.
Too much flaxseed on your granola again, Albert?
I hope you're sitting on newspaper.
It says here they only eat high quality feed, so you should consider this a compliment.
Audubon.com. Why?
Let me guess... President of the "Tippi Hedren" fan club?
You've convinced me of your animal magnetism, but I'm still not interested.
Yeah, I thought his outfit looked a bit seedy.
Wow, this beats the internet.
Looks like you could've left your binoculars at home
Wow! You're lucky! That's a yellow-bellied sap-sucker!
I have the name of a good cleaners if you need it.
I told you not to jog in a suet suit.
Mama always said, life is like a flock of hawklets.
That Hitchcock was stranger than fiction.
It means you eat too many carbs.
Try not to sit so still.
I was bred down south, but I'm just a crumb up here.
I told you you were Tweeting too much, Carl. Look at all the unwanted followers you have now.
Maybe you should back off on the granola.
Maybe you should try to be more statuesque.
It's not the birds' fault. They were just following the trail of crumbs.
It should be clear to each of you that, despite Donald'ls efforts, there is no place in our efforts at the table for Donald.
I wish i was that popular.
I think her daughter is Melanie Griffith by a first marriage.
My advice don't move, just let them finish.
This is exactly why you shouldn't wear a dinner jacket before 7 p.m.
I'm familiar with his work but I've only seen 'Rear Window' and 'Psycho'. Why do you ask?
Oooooo, Hitchcock's 'The Birds'. Grrrrreat book.
I see that you're an ornithologist!
I'll never warm up to tweeting.
Enough murmuring!
Are those the President's tweets?
I suggest throwing it out not up.
Told you the millet suit was a bad idea.
How's that Paleo working out?
Changing to scented soap was a bad idea
You still eating those seedy, whole grain breads?
You must have a birds eye view
How are you liking that flaxseed suit?
You're like a living Twitter mob.
They saw the movie.
I warned you about carrying all those breadcrumbs around
What are they doing?" "Looking for seed money.
Stay away from Sea World.
I saw the downside of Twitter long ago.
Could it be your deodorant?
Do you want me to call animal control or can you handle the situation?
Tell me you at least got Tippi Hedren's autograph.
I think I should begin by understanding why the caged bird sings.
I was just reading a book about loneliness.
Pigeons.
Still feeling seedy?
What the flock!?!?
Do you mind?
How long have you been lovey-dovey?
I warned you not to wear that crumby suit to the park.
Not to worry, they're not migratory.
All your tweets just make look crazy.
So, you poured on maple syrup and then rolled in bird seed? Hmm, I'll have to try that
You never listen to me!.
I hate seasonal allergies, too.
That's why I didn't get a Chia pet.
Bird flu you say? Well, I'm glad it's not contagious.
Run, Forrest. Run.
Mr Hitchcock I presume.
I good go for a snack, Dave. Did you remember to bring the sunflower seeds?
Hey, you got your own little Capistrano goin' here?
Come here often?
What was your tweet?
It says here, suet not suit.
No, I've never had a Tweet go viral. Why?
I hear you've learned how to weave clothing from flax seeds?
Harold, you've gone to seed.
One more reason to stay off Twitter.
I thought you only had pinworms.
Some days the pigeons win; some days the statues win.
Mr Hitchcock I presume.
Hitchcock did it better.
That's the very reason I never wear a suet and tie.
Are you wearing that new peanut oil after shave?
Impressive, but I'm still going to use sunscreen.
I thought you looked like the seedy type.
I told you I distinctly heard the salesman say seed suit,not tweed suit.
Well, I guess the first attempt at the urban scarepigeon backfired.
I don't have time for that social media nonsense!
Yeah, that's why I gave up my twitter account.
Next time get it without sesame seeds.
Would you keep it down over there? I'm trying to read.
I thought "going to seed" was just a metaphor.
Where do you get your ideas from, Mr. Hitchcock?
I used my seed money to invest in pork bellies.
I agree, "Popcorn" would be an evocative scent for a cologne. But you might want to tweak it a little.
Maybe next time you should whistle something different.
I told you to be careful what you tweet.
I warned you about feeding them avocado toast.
Breadcrumbs? Nope, sorry, gluten free.
Looks like it's dinner time.
I guess I'm more of a cat person.
Could it be your aftershave?
If you're naked under there, just don't even say it.
No thanks, I don't eat popcorn.
Get the flock away from me.
How long have you lived in Bodega Bay?
Excuse me, but you are getting lots of tweets. Did you go viral?

It's definitely your cologne or aftershave.

You may need to rethink quinoa clothing.
Walter, who do you think you're fooling?
Frommer's mentioned this part was seedy.
Pardon me, Mr. Peanut, do you have the time?
Ladies and Gentlemen, this man is for the birds.
It's my remedy for empty nest syndrome
You've really picked a poor place to go to seed.
You should consider a napkin the next time you eat a sandwich.
I told you you should cut out bread.
They're picky !
Maybe you should cut back on your Twitter feed?
I told you to stop "retweeting" everything!
I'm new here in Alcatraz. You?
So, how's that tweeting working for you?
Reverend, for being retired you still attract quite an active flock.
Halfway through. Please don't ruin the ending.
Mr. Trump, that is a very flighty coverup!
Looks like you're involved in Twitter storm.
Chirps travel fast around here.
Maybe you should stop tweeting.
Flock off... will ya?! I'm trying to read here
Another tweet...?
You may want to consider a trade, Mr. Harvey. New York isn't for everyone.
John, I know you are old-fashioned and all, but don't you think it's about time you consider switching to email vs carrier pigeon?
How long have you been working at the granary?
You can get on a "do not call" list if you want.
Blame it on those organic crumbs!
Ticks or fleas?
Oh sure, they would take your side.
You really are a chick magnet.
Boy that guy must be covered in birdseed...or they think he's a statue
You are right, you have gone to seed
Mind your own flocking business!
You're supposed to throw them! You hold onto the bread pieces, well........
New suet of clothes?
It says right here only 69 percent of of your carbon came from corn.
I think I know you...'Home Alone 2', right?
Not so nice being pixelated is it Bob?

Eaten up by Pacifism, are you. Would you like to talk about it?
You might want to cut back on your Tweeting, Mr. President.

I knew they'd reject your panko substitute.
I told you that cool beard would come to no good

"Et tu?" Mr. Hitchcock?
Didn't I read somewhere that Melanie Griffith's your daughter?
Tell me more about this new weight loss program.
Can you turn the pages quieter? You are kind of distracting me.
Are you wearing something different this morning, dear?
Too many tweets?
No, I would not advise putting the nuts in your pocket.
I thought you were gluten free.
I told you you smell fowl.
.....and that's why I don't buy my clothing at Old Navy.
How's that vegan suit working out for you?
Another tweetstorm?
New Cologne, Stan?
Audubon is that you?
The book is called "Without Feathers." I'll be glad to loan it to you when I'm done.
The Rubber Band Man has nothing on you.
I suggest wearing something other than Civil War uniforms.
So, I hear you're high on the pecking order.
Alfred's Epiphany
Have you tried reporting them to Twitter?
I see your habit of rolling in bird seed is finally paying off.
DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT SUIT MADE FROM BIRD SEED WILL CATCH ON?
Maybe you should stop tweeting so much.
And which Hitchcock film are you referring to?
I told you not to touch them right after they hatch.
I use eau de feline.
So, Mr. Hitchcock, what will your next movie be about?
That's what you get for shopping at Whole Foods.
Sorry this reminds of the time I fell into the bird pit at the pet store last week. It was terrifying plz delete.
Maybe it wasn't such a great idea to coat yourself in breadcrumbs.
Happy Birdday
How do you pronounce "Columbidae"?
So it says that if a bird flies left to right in front of you, it means you will achieve your goals. If they fly right to left in front of you, you may encounter obstacles. Can you remember which way they were flying?
What the flock are you doing?
Noah? Is that you?
The working title could be Imprinting Gone Wild.
What did you have for lunch?
Just stop all the tweeting, okay?
I sm more of a hawk than a dove.
Life is like a box of what?
Excuse me, but your tweets are very distracting, Mr. President.
If you ditch those seedy clothes, the birds might leave you alone.
Too bad the President doesn't need a scarecrow, you'd be perfect!
Looks like the swallows are returning to Cappy this year.
I like Mary Poppins as much as anyone, but I was a little nervous when you said, "listen to this."
Got any more sunflower seeds?
You should have put your box of chocolates away.
You guys gonna finish that?
What's for dessert?
Do you know any more bird calls?
Miss Gaga, I told you that dress wasn't practical
This is why I'm gluten-free now.
So, just how many Twitter followers do you have?
That wasn't cologne. It was worm juice.
I preferred 'Psycho'.
Well, it's because I'm a failed scarecrow.
Okay, "Camp Town Races" works, too. Try whistling the theme to "Bonanza."
Looks like you've gone to seed.
So, just when did you get out of Alcatraz?
"Your friends missed Capistrano by a long shot".
Maybe an occasional shower would help
"Maybe you should have brushed the crumbs off your shirt"'
Are you trying to do TWEETS again? I thought you learned your lesson last time.
When the kindly old woman singing "tuppence a bag" turns out to be a hired assassin...
Baby, what is a three-letter word for a sticky substance?
Catchy tune, Katniss.
Tuppence a bag eh?
I warned you, Mr. Peanut.
Yes, when you sat down, I thought you looked seedy.
Well, this one is for the birds!
Like I said, "Flock you!"
That suet-scented cologne is really doing it for you.
Feelin' cumby?
I'd say you're? more of a chickadee magnet.
Friend, you really have gone to seed
Just before Passover, you are supposed to be crumb free.
I said you'd look good in Barleycorn 'tweeds.'
Damn, Bill. You should really slow down on the tweeting.
That's not what I meant by a tweet storm!
Don't try the Woodpecker blend.
I blame Gluten.
Can't hear you clearly. Try twittering.
Mom also always liked you better.
Wow! You literally are nuts.
Sorry, I'm reading Tippi Hedren's autobiography.
Sorry, it doesn't go into detail about getting them off AFTER winning a Grammy.
Birdemic
Wow, great bird whistle you got there. Does it work in reverse?
They do really love you back, huh, Mr. Hitchcock.
Honey?
Does it work on women too?
Hey buddy, you may want to check your inbox.
I don't think there's going to be a remake.
That's why I always wear polyester.
I apologize for saying you looked seedy.
Sir, the act reads: pigeon attack is a pre-existing condition.
You're too sweet
I'm trying to read here, could you keep it down please?
I warned you not to whistle that tune.
No, the other cologne.
Please, no sudden moves before I find out whodunit.
I most certainly DID say that 'Tweeting will devour you' wasn't a metaphor.
Taking the sound off Twitter will help.
Eau de Raptor cologne?
Are you familiar with Alfred Hitchcock?
Thanks for asking. I am reading "Eyeless in Gaza" by Aldous Huxley
He must be top seeded.
Toldja not to feed 'em.
Careful, Steven. It says here that purposeful bird calling is the park's leading cause of death.
I warned you about too much tweeting.
I'm sorry I called you "seedy"!
since catching the bird flu, I read in peace.
See, even the birds hate your singing.

It says here not to sit next to seedy guys on park benches...
I'm allergic to pigeons. Whatever you do, don't sneeze.

Clearly, Google Nest is not approved for outdoor use.
So how was the breadcrumb food truck festival anyway?
You may want to re-think that sunflower seed body wash.
And to think all those years I considered cologne superfluous.
Chocolate, schmocolate, *my* mama always said life is like a box of birdseed.
Might want to avoid sunflower seeds at lunch from now on, Morty.

Birdy, your such a show off.
And they said you'd only ever wear your Met Ball outfit once...
I understand your desire to remain an undisclosed source for my story on the current state of the president’s sanity, but you are the President, sir.
That's what you get for tweeting so much, Mr. President.
Which bakery do you use?
I know everything there is to know about the shrimpin business...
You, also, should probably stop Tweeting.
You, my friend, are for the birds.
No, I gave up Twitter, back in January.
You really ought to go gluten free.
Congrats Frank. Looks like you have perfected your "Eau de Bagle"
You've finally gone to seed.
I used to envy your statuesque physique.
Oh, don't get your feathers ruffled, it isn't a true story.
My, what a lot of little feathered friends you have !
Are you from Capistrano?
I see you're using gluten free breadcrumbs.
I don't think that's what your Grandson meant by "tweets".
Well, I know, but does rolling in honey and peanut crumbs really cure a cold?
What did I tell you about tweets?
I suggested a sweatsuit not a suetsuit.
PLEASE, do not feed the birds!
Next time you bring the Subway.
If you just ignore them, they'll eventually stop.
That's why I only wear polyester in the park.
That wouldn't happen if you didn't have such a seedy personality.
New suet-scented aftershave?
Sue it!
Personally, I prefer clothing made from hemp over clothing made from sunflower seeds, but to each his own.
I'm really getting tired of your constant tweets.

Better cut back on your tweets!
Flock off! I was here first.
Must be your aftershave!

I see,Trump tweeted about you...
Probably time to make a rhyme for birds, Gingerbread Man.
Hey! I know a better way to tweet.
Do you have a bird feeder at home?
I told you your cologne smelled of birdseed...
You should've bought the regular bird seed.
It looks like you mistook bread crumbs for bath powder this morning.
Two things 1.) You are an excellent bird magnet how do you do it? 2.) Did you like the story "Bird Man"?
Will you cut out the cooing and the clucking and the flapping and the clicking!! I cannot concentrate!!
It must suck to be a gingerbread man.
I've told you this would always happen Mr. Peanut.
Don't you hate when they suddenly appear?
Gird up or bird up.
I thought you said you had no friends.
You're getting a lotta tweets there
Is that a new fragrance?
Did your doctor suggest you stop eating worms?
Should I read the script from Psycho instead?

Hmm... that's interesting. I always wanted to be an astronaut or a fireman. Never thought about a birdhouse.
George, I think you're eating too many carbs.
Did you tweet something offensive?
Are you Juan Capistrano?
Birds are like that. If they like you, they REALLY like you.
The sign clearly says "Don't eat the people." $20.00 fine
Sometimes life really is stranger than fiction.
Maybe suet isn't the perfect organic moisturizer after all.
I appreciate the effort, honey, but it's not helping my empty nest syndrome.
Were you ever in "The Producers"?
It says here not to throw the seeds against the wind.
It must be hard being a chick magnent.

Too bad. Were you whistling too much or going to seed?

Your fake tweets only make birdbrains bunch up.
Walter, is that you?
Member of the Audubon Society?
By any chance, do you Tweet?
Have you read "The Birds" by Daphne du Maurier?
And I thought they liked bookworms.
Don't know. Sapsuckers, maybe?
Ornithologist in Training	Luke A. Boyd
OK, so it is an easy-care, natural fabric, but it can't be good for your feather alergy
Have you thought of becoming an official Certified Wildlife Habitat?
You know, bird assaults now count as a pre-existing condition.

Reading du Maurier?
That is very strange. The Sallows are not supposed to return until tomorrow.

Is that you, Mr. Hitchcock?
Shit happens.
Can you keep it down!

I thought you looked statuesque.
Maybe you should try a gluten free diet.

No more tweets, Donald
If our calculations our correct you should be airborne any minute.
Well, that's how THEY insanely tweet, Mr. President.

What were you saying, Mr. Capistrano?
Eau de la graine...not a good choice
I'm pretty sure it's bears, not birds... don't move if you see a bear.
Do you Twitter?
No, I didn't say we should have more pecks.
Still beats flying coach.
Your pheromones are showing.

It's a bit stale, Hitchcock.
Perhaps the sunflower seed cologne wasn't a good idea after all.
No, I don't think the world is ready for a suet based cologne.
Your sorghum outfit may not be the best choice for enjoying the park.
Some guys get all the birds.
I told you not to feed the pidgeons.
What have you been up to since you left Alcatraz?
I feel that you and chicken parmesan are best when coated in breadcrumbs
Switching to Pita Bread may have been a mistake.
Please stop tweeting, I'm trying to read.
So you're cast in "Home Alone Meets the Birds"?
Birds are like taxes --- they'll eat you alive...
"Directions to the aviary? You are the aviary!"?
You didn't get enough of that last night?
Working on your Death List, are you?
It's a real honor to find myself sitting next to you, Miss Gaga.
Was that going to be your chia pet costume?
You need a napkin?
Easy, guys, save some for dinner.
Can you please speed up your time of departure?
Tippi Hedren. Hitchcock directed it. I think you'd like it.
Call me when you get to Capistrano.
Told ya that suit went to seed, Arty.
The Bird Man runs out of popcorn.
I've always felt that there's a fine line between pets and pests.
I told you this wasn't the day to try your new eau de baguette.
Free Lunch
Louise, I told you to leave the stale bread at home!
Oh, I forgot to tell you, there was a birdseed on the edge of your cap.
Yes....but what about the benefits of using rosehip seed oil?
That's one fine sapsucker suet you got there.
I told you it was a mistake to wear that worm suit this early in the morning.
That's why I don't bring my cell phone to the park.
I most definitely did not say, "You should wear a nice suet today."
He looked pretty seedy but this is ridiculous
What cologne do you use?
Again, I'm so sorry about the crumbs--that baguette was practically petrified.
. . . and how is my fine-feathered friend today?
I didn't know YOU were going to feed the pigeons.
Are you an ornithologist or something?
Flying rats? No, doves attracted by your inner peace. Sorry, I can't help you.
Worst case of avian flew I've ever seen.
It's working!... yes, yes... be ONE with the pigeon...
Don't let the bird of paradise fly up your nose.
Have you tried apple cider vinegar?
Wow, I guess the chicks really do find you irresistible in that new suet.
Wow! As a birder you're way over the top!
"Wrong. Says here the scariest Hitchcock movie was 'Psycho'".
You're a real nut job.
Keep it down, will ya. Stick to pigeon whispering, please. I'm trying to read here.
Is Twitter offline?
Harry, you've really gone to seed.
Listen to this, Chip… Chip?
You should never have sung "Bye Bye Birdie" off key!
The carmel corn has its drawbacks.
Next time, think twice before you say Hitchcock was overrated.
What does 'ornithologist' mean?
Twitter, huh? So, how many retweets is that?
Tell me more about the three piece suet you are wearing.
I said wear a Suit, not Suet.
I enjoy feeding the birds too, but I would rather use a hanging birdseed feeder.
Are you still using that peanut butter scented body wash?
They´re stool pigeons, and they´re after your dingleberries.
Says here they use the Post It glue on the bird seed; the side effect is diarrhea.
Oh, Honey
Organic flaxseed and sesame aftershave?
"Where's my chair"?
You just look like a 'Francis.'
Thanks for the book recommendation. It's just now getting interesting.
Didn't you used to be Tippy Hedren?
Don’t you think, Saint Francis, that you are taking this lovey-dovey thing too far?
Mohair?
Bird bait.
Would you believe I'm reading Alfred Hitchcock?
What's that aftershave you're wearing?
"But where does the bushel come in?
I warned you not to bring that bread baking book.
OK, that's 39, but I think you’re getting your Hitchcock movies confused.
Ever in Alcatraz?
Personally I steer away from popcorn scented body wash.
Can I get on too?
I told you suet suit was a bad idea.
Breadcrumb bath oil? Not a good idea.
There's actually this movie...
That's the one downside to wearing a suit made of bread crumbs.
Everything bagels are nothing to sneeze at.
So good of you to host despite your troubles.
They must be lovebirds!
They are thanking you for your contribution to the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology.
Meanwhile, Audubon mentions a very rare condition in which middle-aged men exude a suet-like scent.
Your prayers to St. Francis seem to be working!
You're in Bodega Bay, buddy. You better get a can of repellant.
You might ask Batman how he managed.
Lee is gone. There must be a likeness.
Wouldn't moth balls be easier dear?
Bird bait.
No but like, seriously- how does Coruscant work? Do they have any natural resources? population control? What about food, don't give me this "planet made of city" bs
She said "tuppence," not "two pounds."
My seed funding came through.
I hope you are wearing organic clothing!!
You must be one of those "Bird Whisperers". I heard it's for the birds!
Okay, we've figured out how to get your twitter feed up and running. Now we have to customize it.
retweet
Something's off... New heron cut?
I think you're taking tweeting too literally.
I've been meaning to try a natural exfoliation technique.
Although written nearly 60 years ago, Atticus Finch's take on drug addiction could not be more relevant.
First time to Bodega Bay?
You have to keep your mouth closed when you are chewing gum!
yeah, bummer, alcatraz is still closed....
It's organicwear.
No, I guess I've never thought of rolling in birdseed.
'Must be essential oils for them, too.
Now will you believe that you're attractive?
Have you tried that popcorn center cologne?
So much for your suet-based sunscreen.

Sunflower and pumpkin seeds...new, from Dior
Are you getting all this?
A synonym for overwhelmed is oppressed.
I didn't know they still tarred and feathered people.
You know, it's just an expression. It's not actually FOR them.
Sauvignon blanc or sancerre?
Hmmm...time for that shower?!
I read somewhere that pigeons love the smell of oregano.
This must mean you and I are not birds of a feather.
You're going to be sorry when they take off!
They call me the sweet youth of bird.
Remake Hitchcock? Well, maybe. But I don't think an urban setting will work.
Check the label because I think your wearing Organic.
It's probably the the raw food diet
Hey buddy, what's with all the birds?
Spreading the seed on the ground would have been much less stressful.
Frank, I think you nailed the pigeon pheromone project you were working on.
I'm on the Luddite unlimited messaging plan.
That's what you get for letting yourself go to seed.
I'm sorry, I just don't feel like making a Birdman sequel.
Does your cologne have the essence of seed or suet?
I guess birds aren't migrating South anymore...
If you say so, but it seemed like a pretty bad time to spill your suet shake to me.
Go easy on the bird seed, old fellow.
Your Twitter feed is catching on.
No, they are sturnus vulgaris. They are obviously vulgaris. Want to see a picture?
That's one heck of a pigeon call imitation you've got there.
I'm sitting "among", not "in" the birds!
I'm sure they have a pill for that.
My Lord?
Few superhero tales are shorter than Breadman's.
This straw man makes an easy target for the birds.
Over-tweeted again eh?
He did look a bit seedy..
Says here they're called "birds".
This is why making your empty nest an Airbnb can be risky.
Didn't get that. What did you say ?
Best Halloween costume ever!
Impressive but that's not what people mean by tweets.
Millet:The New Wool
Yeah. Maybe you should cut down on the bread.
You should go Gluten Free.

Are you sure you joined the correct Love Bird dating site?
uh yes, I am reading 'Hidden figures' by Margot Lee Shetterly. I think you'd like it.
Let me guess, you're reading the Birdman of Alcatraz.
Must be your "Eau de Bread" aftershave.
I had gnats once.
Have you read to kill a mockingbird?
I told you that listening to The Carpenters would have consequences.
What's the matter, don't you guys like literature?
Pillsbury dough boy "relaxes" at the WRONG park!
I'd really appreciate it if you would just get the flock out of here.
They must like bread bums.
You're going to the birds, Harry.
I guess this is what they mean by "pigeonholing"
This is why most start-ups don't survive the first seed round.
I told you not to wear that Nature perfume!!
I think you've taken this 'green' thing a little too far...
The revitalized carrier pigeon industry needs your messages.
"You've got mail".
So, for you millenials, it's live feathers without the tar?
No, it says here the Mourning Warbler has a yellow belly.
Food for thought?
Rumor has it that you have gone to far in pigeon-holing yourself on Facebook
That's what you get for doing 'The Worm' in public.
I was going to ask you where you got that outfit, it looked a bit seedy.
Using that Bird Seed Allure cologne?
Ok, I beleieve you. You are Alfred Hitchcock.

Tippi Hedren? Is it really you?
The Sign Said "Don't Feed the Birds" Joe Pitts Washington, DC
??Just like me, they long to be close to you??.
I never expected to get pidgeon-wholed.
Maybe your parents shouldn't have named you Juan Capistrano.
I think what you thought was cologne with the weird name is used for something else.
Don't worry, this is common since the statues are gone.
Your name wouldn't be Hope, by any chance?
Been shopping for clothes in the seed catalog?
If you shower in birdseed, you have to thoroughly rinse.
So, you left a trail of breadcrumbs, and then what…?
Axe body spray?
Whose feeding who? Or shall I say 'whom?'.
First round of seeding?
You are my Tippi Hedrin-Donald Trump fantasy.
Odds are that you’ll get the bird flu that’s going around.
Lucky, we tried to get our kids to stay in-state when they were applying; they just laughed at us
I'm sorry, all I did was say birds of a feather flock together.
Couldn't help noticing that you really are for the birds.
I told you not to eat Chex Mix in the park.

So where are you in the pecking order?
I told you not to wear eau de pidgeon
My momma always said ...
Would you mind moving? I'm allergic to feathers.
You look downright seedy today.
How in the world did you know my book was about ornithology?
I'm thinking the gingerbread suit is a mistake.
I think it was 'wear suit', they fat fingered the 'e'.
Perhaps you shouldn't sit so still...
That late night chia hair replacement infomercial did say results may vary...

You're full of Tweets!
The wife says I'm completely nuts!
So, you have a patent pending for popcorn-scented sunscreen?
Death by news feed
You really could just say you don't want to be in book club anymore.
I never read Audubon out here.
The field guide says they feed on carrion. Are you listening? The guide says ... Oh.
Forgot to offer up a sacrifice to the Pigeon god again?
I told you to wipe your mouth after eating peanut butter crackers.
Just what kind of granola is that?
So, you're a bird feeder?
What did you say was in that organic sun screen you bought?
Look on the bright side, Chap. They will help rid you of the head and body lice
Oh, you're a retired baker, I thought you said banker.
You know Mr. Hitchcock, it surprises me that they have that kind of memory
Have you tried the new bakery
You must be from the South.
I reading Alfred Hitchcock's the Birds, why do yo ask?
This bird call book is amazing! Sic 'em, Fido!
Yeah, it's a good book, if you like crumby endings?
Well that's what you get for wearing an outfit made totally from hemp seeds.
Better 'an being henpecked.
OK, I'm sorry for calling you seedy.
They seem to really like the gluten-free stuff.
Tuppence?
You're right. Your pigeon call is spectacular.
Really Alfred? You never pay your extras?
Those sesame seed suits just aren't practical.
Boy, are you going to need a shower!
Are you a statue of President Trump?
Hold on! I found it! It says right here, "birds of a feather...."
They might be after your inner child.
Wow this Hitchcock biography is really coming to life!
Birds' nest soup for lunch?
The Sign Said "Don't Feed the Birds" Joe Pitts Washington, DC
Maybe it just sounded like 'Go flock yourself!'
One tweet too many, Ed; that's my guess.
Mama always said life was like a block of suet.
Flock together, eh?
They're partial to the multigrain bagels.
I take it you're a birder.
They think you dress seedy, too.
I'm just not sure if a down jacket is for me.
You're actually pretty lucky. The last guy sitting there got a different kind of attention."
Great hiding place. No one will look for you here.
I told you carbs were bad.
Yes, Ms. Hedren, I have seen "The Birds." Why do you ask?
I said you had to bring crumbs.
got any bird seed on you?
Harry, you're looking a little seedy today
Hang on, my pet hawk is on his way.

This is hawkward....

Aren't you carrying this Saint Francis Thing a bit far?
Warned you—sit still like a statue, and...
They say it's advantageous to only swipe right on the ones you really like
As I told you, dipping yourself in bread crumbs before coming to the park is not a good idea.
Ooh, that's going to leave a mark.
I told you not to use All Spice.
We found that using large grain seed, like corn didn't attract so many.
Is that a worm in your pocket? Cause they sure are happy to see you.
How do you come up with all those crazy plots, Mr. Hitchcock?
If you wanted to be my fine feathered friend you should have just said so
Maybe it's time to stop sending tweets.
If they are carrier pigeons...I believe they are carrying the avian flu.
How close are we to the 647 birds you said last week was your limit?
Did you say "tweed" or "seed"?
Tweeting about it isn't going to change anything!
Here often?
Perhaps you should change your after shave.
It must be that ne after shave you are wearing.
Looks like your vacation rental site that you use for subletting your coop overbooked the number of guests arriving.
Told you that new cologne was for the birds.
"What a

I know you're lonely, but that's no reason to go overboard with the crumbs.
I'm gluten free.
I thought you looked a little seedy.
You're gonna have to reduce the price from tuppence a bag
Maybe you should just go by R. Crumb instead of B. 'Red' Crumb.
I warned about whistling Blue Birds of Happiness!
Reverend, you seem popular with the new congregation.
This is exactly why I never whistle.
Who knew? Even birds want to try butter coffee.
You're gonna need a new suet of clothes.
Has anyone told you that you look statuesque?
Everything I am reading says you should be a cat person.
This is why I told you not to wear your breadcrumb suit today.
Holier than thou catholic?

I told you not to install the squab ringtone.

Moderation in all things Snow White.
I warned you about showering with that birdseed scented soap
I'm sorry Mr. Hitchcock, this script is completely implausible.
' I heard that you had gone to seed."
I'll have what you had for breakfast!
I thought I told you to get the flock out of here!
What's a few bread crumbs? Just pay up, capiche?
I think they wanted more.
I wonder how many Weight Watchers points that is.
So this is what it sounds like...when they make US cry.
I wish you would stop wearing those seedy outfits
The difference between a casual reader and a book worm
Looks like you got your tuppins worth
I'm sorry, but what did you say your name was?
I guess you really are feeling crumby today.
I'm gluten free.
Lots of folks feed pigeons, but I am impressed by your generosity.
He said his name was Tom Lehrer and he kept bragging about poisoning pigeons in the park.
Can you think of something that rhymes with "words"?
Is that a sesame seed suit?
No, this novel 'To Kill A Mocking Bird' is not a 'how-to' guide. Why do you ask?
So, you must have a lot of followers on Twitter?
I heard they were doing a remake of "The Birds"...You must be an Extra
"The Birdman of Alcatraz," what are you reading?
I told you if you kept cursing at me, I'd give you the bird !
How many times have I warned you about your tweets?
Wow-- since you lost that job, you've really gone to seed.
Don't look at me, Jane, I invested my tuppence with Dad.
D you think it's your wiry hair?
Sh-sh! Stay still. They're vision is based on movement.
Is your gluten-free diet still corn-based?
Well, there that IS a drawback to wearing all natural fibers.
Didn't anyone warn you not to tweet?
What did I tell you about tweets and phones?
Try changing your cologne.
Is your suet bespoke?
Are you Mr. Peanut?
I read the obits this morning and guess what? You're in it.
I told you. Gluten free feed...they love it.
I told you they wouldn't be amused...
D you think it's your wiry hair?
Odd; you don't look seedy.
I understand you a decendant of the Noah family?
I loved the Odd Couple. Was your mother Cecily or Gwendolyn Pigeon?
I told you not to wear that tshirt from Capistrano to the park.
Yeah, I guess the birdseed suit is less distracting than last week's milkbone suit.
Okay, so I won't call you 'honey' any more.
Have you tried going to b  Have you tried calling Tippi Hedren?
My heart fluttered when I first saw her.
That's for the birds!
I told you birdseed isn't the new polka.
It's more than likely the multi-grain bread you're eating.
You know, birds flock to boxes of chocolate.
Your one seedy fellow with a hell of a following.
Wow this 5D reading is pretty awesome
Munchery?
Just turned 65, the "horror", chillin at the park - but don't fill the bird seeder at home in your valor jumpsuit before you come, you'll catch all the stray crumbs!
Eco-friendly clothing made from recycled bird seed probably sounded like a good idea.
You're sitting in the pigeon's seat on this park bench!
Didn't I say you were sending too many tweets?
It must be that Dove Cologne.
Your name is Eliot Nest.
Oh, the perils of tweeting!
You a Buffalo Tom fan?
Have you got alight?
Bob had finally convinced his homebody neighbor Al to come sit in the park. On reflection, what happened next was really not so surprising.
You can stop tweeting now, Donald.
They think your shirt said, "Root-Rooster."
Maybe the park wasn't such a good icea, Ginger, er Mr.Breadman
''I said bookworm, not book of worms."
Too much Birdma Shave?
Surely, you should sue your suet suit sewer.
I think it's God's way of letting you know how much of a pigeon you were for voting for Donald Trump.
So it says here you get your best movie ideas from real life events. Is that true, Mr. Hitchcock?
What app are you using?
I warned you about the organic dry-cleaning.
Serves you right, you miserable freak!
I told you Fred, with these carrier pidgeons, you need to check your inbox every day.
Hey, Mr. Audubon, would you please stop singing?
Okay, okay, this proves it -- you're the king of twitter.
Are you working undercover for the Environmental Protection Agency?
I said wear a Suit, not Suet.
And Hitchcock still wouldn't take a meeting?
Hi Alfred
This book says the Bird Man of Alcatraz has reincarnated . . . Can I see your face?
Could you repeat that? All I hear are tweets.
Not quite what I meant when I asked if you could spare a Dove Bar.
Is anybody in there?
I told you not to wear your suet suit.
Have to admit, I kind of miss them.
Getting back on the booze would be healthier.
I used to be henpecked too until I learned to assert myself. I still miss her.
I know a bird in hand is worth two in the bush, but why take it to such extremes?
If you feed them, they forget how to survive on their own.
Which proves that pigeons really like the peanuts in caramel corn.
"Your sitting on their mother!,Damn it".
Have you seen the movie Hitchcock made based on that book you're reading?
Eau de Black-Oil Sunflower might have been a bad choice...
Looks like things have gone south for you.
Hey, didn't you just love the movie, The Birds?
They can sense your seediness.
I know you Love feeding the pigeons, but don't you think the Peanut Butter/Bird Seed "bath" was a bit over the top?
Portland, you've gone too far.
So what's your favourite Hitchcock movie?
Are you tired of winning yet Mr. Spicer?
Budget cuts and witness protection won't mix
Excuse me. Does the bus to Alcatraz stop here?
Really Francis, don't you think you're going a bit overboard?
Mind if I borrow this?
I'm reading a book on bird watching and this is distracting.
hey pal, get the flock otta here.
I'll read just about anything in the park other than that St. Francis biography...
I told you not to get the one with poppy seeds.
Herringbone?
Could you spare tuppence?
How's the new breadcrumb regimen going?
That's one hell of a cologne.
how's that new Brooks Bros. Bread Crumb suit working out?
You're flocking kidding me!
You always talk about being a well-bred man.
Wow, he sure fits in the pecking order.
you lawyers should not say sue it in the park.
Are you enjoying your visit from Alcatraz?
I see you've sold them on your nest egg.
Maybe it's because you tweet too much.
My gene analysis confirmed it - I really am part bird.
I'd be more careful if I were you. You can never tell which ones carry canarial diseases.
Seriously typecast, Tippi. (Too subtle?)
Bird Lovers, Jesus...poor sap.
I told you not to wear that sesame seed tie
You're the first person I've met who wanted to be a birdbath.
Stop telling corny jokes.
It's why I never feed birds of a feather.
Reading another seedy novel, eh?
You need to come out of your shell.
Alfred, is that you?
The Audubon Society must have cashed my check...
You really need to come out of your shell.
Are you sure the white residue is dandruff?
Last Christmas? But I thought your own true love was just sending you two!
Are you sure this is what it means to be a "birder"?
You must smell fowl!
I'd heard that millet was the new quinoa. Is this an unanticipated consequence?
yea,well they insulate nice but, very high maintainence.
Have you just been tarred?
Probably a hormonal response to your body wash. So you know they are all males.
You're a rare species. You're going to attract the Audubons.
This is where Hitchcock made the film, you know.
You gotta stop tweeting
No, no! Says right here: "Seedy": "Sordid and Shabby" not "Yummy and nutritious!"
I would stop tweeting if I were you.
And you say it is because you are covered with Gluten Free Bird feed?
I thought that guy looked a little seedy.
I told you to stop being so crumby.
Next time stay away from the Iced Coconut Milk Mocha Macchiato!
'eau de cat', 'eau de worm', if your trying to read, guess what's 'eau de stupid'.
'Cote'? It's a homonym.
You might rethink choosing pine-scented aftershave.
What have you got that I haven't got?
That's what a pishing ventriloquist does. Other questions?
I see you've really got that call of the Buffed Tit perfected.
Maybe the Eau de Popcorn was a bad idea.
So you consider yourself a real chick magnet?
This is great practice for my ebook recording. Do you want to hear it again?
Thaat must be some feedback for your Twitter message.
"HITCHCOCK IS THAT YOU " ?
You might want to drop the seedy cologne.
Love birds?
There is no conference table.
I'm beginning to think this bus will never arrive.
Chirpies, eh? Too bad - there's no known tweetment.
I think you are going to seeds.
It's not a good idea to seed your lawn on such a windy day.
I told you not to wear the corn suit.
I don't care how many birds you attach to yourself, you are not getting off the ground.
Yeah, man, I remember the time the Egyptian god Tehuti materialized in my house and cursed me to be pecked by birds for all eternity. Shit sucks, man
Stop the happy tweeting, please.
New cologne from "Bird?"
I thought I told you not to cover yourself with peanut butter!
Lemme guess. You had a sesame bagel for breakfast?
This reminds me of the second Home Alone movie.
So you speak pigeon?
Look on the bright side; you are worth way more than two in a bush.
That cologne you're wearing smells positively delicious.
I would offer an olive branch, but its a fairly partisan flock.
Rookie mistake. The Sunflower Suit from Banana Republic is not a great idea in Central Park.
My Grandfather was the Birdman of Alcatraz
You say you're Tippi Hedren's great-grandson?
How many times did I warn you about your edible hemp clothes?
She just hasn't been the same since that kid gave her a turtle dove.
Hey check it out I'm reading Infinite Jest. David Foster Wallace was a GENIUS, man.
That seed diet of yours really proves we are what we eat.
You are probably one of those people who call them rock doves.
Here come numbers 139 and 140.
You've always been strictly for the birds.
"What a
I told you it was windy today
It says here that you should not use biodegradable laundry dnetergent
Beautiful day we're having, Miss Hedron. Beautiful day.
I thought your aftershave was a smidge too nutty.
How's that Quinoa diet working for ya?
"I told you not to read TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD." It gets them upset.
I warned you not to make that movie, Alfred!
That's one way to spend your seed money.
What are you two tweeting?
Birds of a feather flock together, Mr. Bird
Yes, I know they're homing pigeons. But how'd you get to be their home?
Have you considered not tweeting so much?
Herman, I think we can safely say "That new after shave is "for the birds!".
nice seed suit
Any chance you're from Alcatraz?
Sorry, the birds here go a little The Birds sometimes
Well, I'm a BOOK lover, but I occasionally put 'em down.
What? I can't hear over all that pecking.
I see the swallows are back.
Well, nice meeting you, Mr. Peanut.
Love birds? I'm jealous!
What's happening over there?
I see the swallows are back.
They think you look seedy too.
They do like it better than the old feed.
I'd clap my hands but I can't put it down.
I guess life, IS like a box of chocolates
I'm reading the latest New York Times best seller, No bird brains allowed.
If you don't like it, don't wear those feather hats.
Yea, you told me you have skin problems. So they work like those pedicure fish?
"So, now you know why I gave up wearing a crumb-jacket to the park".
I am thrilled that I finally get to meet one of the greatest film directors of all time, Alfred Hitchcock.
You may want to reconsider the sunflower oil body wash.
This place is for the birds.
Sorry, Ms. Hedren, I only just recognized you.
Here's a bit of trivia. These birds are the direct descendants of those used in the Hitchcock film!
I'd hate to be your dry cleaner.
Hey, hold down the cooing or get an aviary!
First time in the City? You never, never, never, bring a peanut butter sandwich!!
What kind of bread are you been giving them!?
I guess we read the same gossip columns.
How long have you been working at "BirdFeed-R-Us"?
You say it's called Eau De Oiseau?
And that's why most parks prohibit bars with all natural ingredients.
And this is not the only downside of too much tweeting, Donald.
Are you wearing that new Eau de Suet?
Gee, you're more popular than the Statue of Liberty.
I told you to use a napkin!
Don't forget your safeword is Lemmiwinks.
How are those organic fibers working for you?
Some days you are he legion and some days you are the statue
That must be some lunch you have
You must be a crumb bum.
It must be your charisma.
I see you ordered wings.
Excuse me, you wouldn't happen to be Sir Paul, would you?
So I guess in hindsight, sunflower oil is not a great substitute for cologne, huh?
I warned you about the hard shell tacos.
I'm reading Michener, and you say you're reading Hitchcock.
Crumb cake?
So I'm guessing the balloons didn't work out?
To be inundated with President Trump's tweets
Love means never having to say 'I'm out of bread crumbs."
Please Keep Off the Grass Dealer.
Serves him right for getting a meatball sandwich on 9-grain bread.
It must be fashion week.
Didn't your mother ever tell not to wear a birdseed suit after Labor Day?
The worst part is when they flush.
Is your name Tippi?
I hope for your sake the early bird did /not/ get the worm.
Been using that suet cake after shave again?
Don't be so surprised! "Birds of a feather really do flock together!" Guys, really now, the pecking order is an issue that needs to wait!! Ouch!
I said, "Wear your best suit to meet her; not your best suet!"
You really are a bird brain.
Maybe I should just Google it?
No thank you. I don't care to feed the birds.
Your going to have some cleaning bill!
You looked too seedy
So, that's what zen looks like.
I told you cologne called ‘bird seed’ was a bad idea.
You better get a selfie or no one will believe you.
May the doves of peace decend on you as Manna from Heaven
Sue it!
Do you always feed the birds this time of day?
Hi,stranger. You remind me of a fellow from Assisi
You are a really seedy fellow, Jay.
Who do you think was the more accurate, Du Maurier or Hitchcock?
I could not help noticing you are wearing Wing Tip shoes and I would love a pair. Where ever did you get them?
The Perch
I have kids that took advantage of me, too.
Am I seeing what I`am seeing?
Do you mind? It's hard to read when you're tweeting so much.
New suet?
I told you they weren't gluten intolerant.
If you weren't such a crummy guy this might not happen so often.
Those really are for the birds.
There must be dozens and dozens in the bush
I can't concentrate with all that tweeting
Well, you do look a lot like Hans Christian Andersen.
That's why I prefer singing the Don Giovanni.
I always said, birds of a feather flock together.
sounds like a great idea for a movie Mr. Hitchcock
It appears they've taken to your hemp suit.
No, I wouldn't fry them. Try broiling, instead.
So how come they call you Pigeon Joe?
So, what were you saying about your organic clothing?
Boy, you must be feeling crummy.
Is that you, Sean?
You should really stop wearing that Bernie For President t-shirt.
I don't mean to be a downer, but this is too much PDA
I told you not to use the "natural" moisturizer
I always make sure my suits are gluten free.
When did you first consider yourself a Peacenik?
Say you once served time on Alcatraz?
So, what screenplay are you writing now, Mr. Hitchcock?
You must be the new press secretary.
Do you think I'm flighty?
Run, Forrest. Run.
Let me guess. You're for the birds?
You must be a pretty seedy character!
You said that you were from Alca where?
I'm not sure New York is the best place to be selling pigeon pheromones.
Yep. It says right here...mixing breadcrumbs with tanning lotion gives you an extra layer of protection against the sun's harmful rays.
That's why there are laws against feeding the pigeons.
um...excuse me sir, do you have any bread on you by any chance?
Enough with the birds already.
Would you mind keeping it down? I only get 20 minutes for lunch, and I'm near THE END.... You read the sign, yes?
What a funny outfit you have on today, Delores.
That stopped for me soon after I went gluten-free.
By chance, are you a Hitchcock?
You only go around once, Dick.
They know that people reading books aren't going to feed them.
It may be the Essence of Popcorn after shave
Don't get excited, no rare sightings according to my bird book.
Got a tuppence you could spare?
Now I know why linseed oil is such an effective sunblock!
Hitch, is that you?
Either they knew you were an ornithologist or it was that bag of seeds in your pocket!
What did you just tweet to get you so many followers?
Excuse me, I think you sat on my peanut butter and sesame seed sandwich.
I hate retweeting, too.
Joe, it's you! If you don't mind my saying so, you really have let yourself go to seed.
Looks to me like you are going to seed
It must be the gourmet bird seed.
So how often do you have to smear the peanut butter and seeds on your body?
Those who don't deny it refer to it as global-local birding.
Oh, I thought you said 'a frock.'
I'm beginning to think 'To Kill a Mockingbird' might be a metaphor.
When I was a kid I had this really neat parakeet...
I should have told you.... Michael Keaton was just sitting there.
You'll never criticize Hitchcock again.
So then Tippi Hedren says, "They're coming! They're coming!"
I stopped going to the Bread Crumb Cafe. The food is good but you need to vacuum afterwards.
I thought doves make peace, not break into pieces
Nice to meet you, Mr. Gano. And is there a Mama Gano as well?
Welcome to Bodega Bay.
Would you like me to read you a story?
Me. President, they are sending a message
Alfred, I thought it was your finest.
Pro-tip: next time don't wear a seed-covered shirt.
They can detect a seedy character.
I think you are overdoing the sunflower seed smoothies.
You really need to stop with the tweeting.
Not "crumbly." I'm feeling crummy, CRUMMY.
That's what you get for wearing a seedsucker suit to the park.
Weren't you also the bird man of Alcatraz?
I guess that's why they call it Pigeon Park.
Why are you always first in the pecking order?
When did you switch from horse whisperer to birds?
Coup, coup.
I told you you'd have trouble in the park today, Mr. Capistrano.
Welcome to Washington, bub.
Why Bert Federman, what've you been up to?
Peter, pickled peppers get pecked.
What do you know? Alfred Hitchcock was right.
Your body tattoo really fooled them.
How did they figure out that my name is Cletus Birdsong?
You give a new meaning to the words "nature lover!"
Didn't see the Hitchcock movie, but I read the book.
I TOLD you to get on a gluten-free diet.
Have you found any downside to wearing organic cotton?
Alfred Hitchcock made a movie about this!
Let me know when you're finished.
You must be full of nuts.
Alcatraz is looking good about now, isn't it?
It's all about you Gregory, Atticus whatever your name is.
Did you say your name was Hitchcock?
Next time use the cologne without seeds
Yeah I hear you don't knock it until you try it, but I would find the excrement troubling.
Those are the 'birds of a feather' I was telling you about.
Apparently, this is why they call you, "Guano Head.
Maybe it's your cologne.
How much are they worth in the bush?
The hat with the feathers brought this on you.
When they say Dove is unscented they mean to you; for birds it's a different story
What's this? The new fashion style?
Oh, I thought you mentioned going gluten-free.
So do you crush the cornflakes before you spray yourself with an egg wash and roll in them or after?
I think your magic wand shorted out.
Mr. Stroud, I presume?
Enough of the "tweeting" Mr. President
I'll continue when you're done tweeting.
A little too much suet after-shave?
I've never thought that organic birdseed based clothing fabric was a good idea.
It was only a matter of time before the descendants of Hitchcock's extras repeated their ancestors' carnage.
Is your peanut smooth or crunchy?
Is it me?" "Is it me?
You keep brushing your teeth with peanut butter.
It takes a village.
From the smell of your burp I assume you're vegetarian.
I'm reading the Collected Tweets of Donald J. Trump.
Rules are rules. You can't complain about dogs off leash while you're feeding the birds.
You have always looked statuesque.
It's called 'pig' pile - not 'pig'-eon pile!
You should watch your carbs.
I told you not to eat all that bread.
You sure get a lot of tweets!
Fred, you really do know your birds!
How long has it been since you bathed? Is it a new aftershave?
Of course I loved the texture, but I told you the birdseed suit would backfire.
Now I understand why people call you a seedy politician.
Some think it an unusual aphrodisiac.
Birds of a feather really do flock together
I hate technology.
Yeah, I thought your comment was seedy too.
I warned you about drinking all of those Frappuccinos!
I wish I had that many retweets
My wife loves natural exfoliants.
It must be your toes.
You can get really cheap airfare to Vegas these days, you know.
Mike, your new cologne should be called, 'Human Bird Feeder'.
At least the pigeons like your cologne...
You should eat less bread.
That's a pretty good impression of bird seed you've got going on there.
As for flight insurance, I think you're covered.
I've always admired your films, Mr. Hitchcock.
Is that a Woody Harrelson hemp suit?
That bird food MUST be gluten free!
Did your mother sing you a lullaby every night too!
You asked for it, Mr. Hitchcock.
Its good to see competition in the message carrying space.
This may just be the latest frenzy the world is experiencing.
I told you not to buy that cologne from that nature store
rughtnowitis42for4againstand2abstaining
You are carrying being a bird lover too far !
Bates Motel? You're in the wrong movie.
I guess that's the last time you use Nuit du Pigeon Cologne.
It says here that the new pigeon scented body wash is a popular item these days.
Well, that's what you get when you sleep in a bed of bird seed.
1. I thought this man looked "seedy." 2. He must have a lot of bread on him. 3. This bench is for the birds!
Quoth the Raven, nevermore
Dude, totally Not what I meant by download...
Are you going to finish that?
Stop whistling!
So you're Father Kennedy from St Mary's with your flock?
Personally, I think you have taken " a bird in the hand" to the extreme!
Are you going to "tweet" about this?
I did the Ice Bucket Challenge but this is going too far
Sorry, just a few more minutes. This new translation isn't very good.
Mildred told me that you had gone to seed, but I scoffed.
Even the birds thought he was a seedy character.
You can't nest yourself from reality forever.
I'm reading 'The Birds'. Would you like to borrow it when I'm through?
I told you that suite was from a seedy place.
The hazing has REALLY gotten out of hand over at Sigma Chi.
You a Hitchcock fan?
Things are about to get hawkward.
Pigeon porn may not have been the best reading choice
You know what they say, "The early bird catches the ..."
Talk about a vivid plot!
I'm reading, "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest".
What brand of bird feed do you use?
Well, I guess, you cannot keep birds from building a nest.
You should have had a proper burial and service for that pigeon you hit yesterday.
Mr. Peanut?
Why yes, I am reading the " Birdman of Alcatraz."
I'm hungry for companionship, too.
Pigeons are the new thing man. You'll never get the ladies looking like that.
I'd agree. Coveralls made from bird seed is not your best idea.
That Peanut Oil Cologne didn't work for me, either.
It must be a new sandwick sesame seed on Rye!
Some days you feel like a nut.
St. Francis would bless you.
City ordinance-- four and twenty Max
Method actor Jared Leto regrets taking a starring role in 'The Birds' remake when he finds out that the rest of the cast just read the book.
Is there a pecking order, sir ?
I see we're late again with the spring fashion
Did you wear your glasses?
So was that your first tweet?
My advice: envelopes and stamps!
May I ask what brand of bird seed you use?
That is exactly why seed is illegal
You did ask for a peck!
Rest in peace Gingerbread Man
Seedy people are so misunderstood.
Nick Cave, I presume?
I guess, I prefer reading my novel.
Ms. Hedren, I'm a big fan of your work.
Looks like you've exceeded your character count for that tweet.
Remember when I told you to avoid the sesame seed bun?
Do you have on that new cologne, odour de' Bread Crumb?
Excuse me, but where did you get your three-piece suet tailored?
Maybe you'd better close that box of chocolates.
Boy, you must be feeling pretty crummy...
Roger, you've completely gone to seed.
Nice seed-sucker suit
You must be already hitchcock!
So, you're Alfred Hitchcock's bird wrangler?
That's why the pigeons never poop on me.
Do you use a fabric softener?
Hi, I'm Twitter's new mascot.
When you said birds find you irresistible, I thought you meant girls.
It's a pity they migrate in the winter.
A word of advice, they usually like bread crumbs.
Hey Tippi Hedren, can you keep it down over there?
Looks like that deodorant isn't working so well.
Too many poppy seeds on the bagel?
I've read that smartphones are less hassle than carrier pigeons.
I hope you're happy now, you're the one who just had to go birding.
I told you to TOSS the birdseed.
Working long hours at the bakery, eh?
Could you tweet a bit quieter?
Hope you brought some Purell.
You did say your job was for the birds.
Hey- I hear they're casting for Home Alone 6.
So, what did Hitchcock think of your idea?
I simply covered you with honey and birdseed so I could read my damn book!
I usually avoid the birdseed bodywash.
Herring Bone tweed?
You have impeccable taste.
Are you ok?" "Yes, I'm seed funding the next Twitter!
Peanut perfume?
You know,I'm not quite together with this.
That's what you get for being such a nut.
It's that millet latte again isn't it Frank?
No, I didn't say that a three-piece suet would make you look more professional.
Don, I've told you before, early morning tweeting is never a good idea!
Go back to your book, we are almost done here
I guess I shouldn't of thrown that birdseed on him earlier..
The horse whisperer has nothing on you!
Macaulay Culkin running late?
That confirms - you are a seedy character.
You said you wanted a birdbath.
Maybe you should eat less carbs.
Hey, you got your start at Alcatraz in the 1950s, didn't you?
Are you by any chance R. Crumb?
Have you ever tried just reading “The Birds”?
I wonder if I can spin this to Barb as a microcosm for why we need pecking orders.
Easy, big fella. 'Food for thought' is more than a commodities deal.
Is it me or has this park gotten seedier?
So I see you finally got your seed money.
How's your new gig at Esquire going?
Mind if I try a little of that tobacco you're smoking?
Sunflower cologne is never a good idea
This is why society needs to cut down on carbs.
I told you that bird seed suit would come to no good.
You are not supposed to feed the pigeons
So what sort of education background does someone need to become a bird whisperer?
I told you better not sit here, Mr. Gingerbread Man...
I don't think your cologne is gluten-free.
Mama always said life was like a flock of hawklets. You never know what you’re gonna get.
Might I ask what cologne you're wearing?
Oh. So, this is where the Audubon meets!
Showboat.
"Seed money", you said? How does that work exactly?
Alfred here. Glad to meet you, Tippi.
I told you your clothes were getting seedy.
And would you believe, flypaper was the first of my successful inventions.
I think you may have fed them one too many bread crumbs.
This bird repellant was certainly worth the money.
I promise they don't make you look too outdoorsy.
It's because you tweet more than the president.
I told you not to eat so many sardines for lunch!
it is very humane of you mr hitchcock to feed the birds
Would this be a bad time to return the turtle doves?
They think you're incapable of love.
I think they'll calm down if you stop tweeting.
I give up. What is your favorite Hitchcock movie?
Amazing how many seeds tuppence will buy, isn't it?
The proverbial Birds of Paradise!
Save some for me.
The letter had only one sentence: the killer went by the nickname, breadcrumbs. The end.
That's why I stopped wearing cologne at the park.
Back in my day, we threw the crumbs on the ground.
I've often described you as statuesque.
You're in luck.
Frankly, I've never heard of a wear feather friend, let alone met one.
This say's you should dump the egg salad sandwich
Enough with the Brenda Fricker impersonation.
I hear he's also stopping funding for public television.
Hey mate, what's your secret for getting all the birds.
So tell me, where do you get your movie ideas, Mr. Hitchcock?
How was your stay in Alcatraz?
At least your book doesn't suck.
You're late with the spring fashion
Do they know about your bird soup recipes?
Did you try "GET THE FLOCK OUT OF HERE!"
Look like your inbox if full.
Perhaps you should shower right after your shift at the bakery ends.
Hey, pal. Who's next in the pecking order?
I'd get the bagel without the seeds next time.
Maybe whole-grain bread for your sandwich was not the best choice.
They must have smelled the sunflower seeds on your breath.
You better only have been eating whole grains.
No, they said they wanted to *flock* you. Flock.
It says they're pigeons.
That's the problem with wearing a tweed suit in the park.
Best "Master Sleeping Pigeon Pose" I've ever seen.
Looks like you have it covered.
The recipe call for blackbirds.
I swear I said Tweed suit.
He probably had bread crumbs on him, so it's his fault.
Please! Enough with the tweets!
Most homeless are not that seedy.
I warned you not to send that tweet!
I'm impressed, you really are the best bird caller I have ever heard.
I stay away from the two pence suits.
See what happens when you #pigeons.
Did you buy some love birds?
Racing Pigeon Rescue? I fancied there would be cages involved.
"I think Lady GaGa has already done that".
It's gonna take a real bombshell to push this company to success!
Is that you, Francis?
I think your new Duck Call needs a little more tweaking!
You need to learn how to relax. This "tweeting thing" has taken over your life.
You should start using my bird repellent.
Looks like you took Trump's latest tweetstorm both seriously and literally.
You make too much noise.
Hey, at least it wasn't catnip!
Are you testing out a new "mobile disguise," Mr. Spicer?
Your new bird call is really effective attracting then,but how do you get them to fly away?
Aristophanes' "The Frogs". Why do you ask?
You should fix that loose thread.
I have noticed that some of your clothes are looking a bit seedy
Excuse me, my imagination is trying to take flight.
How are things at the breadcrumb factory?
Running a seed fund?
Bird Man??
You might want to change your tune.
So, you're doing the suet challenge?
Wow. How do you do it?
I wanted James Bond and instead I get Mary Poppins
This is a no-popcorn-eating zone.
Your interpretation of "Birdland" is spot on.
You promised them what?
Are you Tippi Hedren?
Too many bread crumbs
How long have you been a Hitchcock fan?
Is that you, Larry?
Now that's what I call a cheep suit!
Frank, where is Assisi?
I thought you weren't going to wear that "meat dress" any more.
Excuse me, Did you use oatmeal soap today?
Party fowl!
Sir, you are an extremely seedy individual.
In today's world,you're more likely to become a waste dump than a National Trust property.
Look at the birds of the air. They do not sow or reap.
Do you smell something foul?
Mr. President, I know you seek attention, but . . . .
Are those birds of a different feather flocking together?! Unimaginable! Why, if that happened in politics, Trump would never have made it into office.
"It does seem strange Mr. Hitchcock".
Oh dude! I told you to quit bingeing on Hitchcock movies.
No, I haven't heard of the corn meal catalog.
Mr. Peanut?
Chocolates ... and that's all I've got to say about that.
You're still here. Maybe try balloons instead?
Just stop speaking so much pidgin English.
-What is going on? -New York state of mind
Mr. Hitchcock, is this for the sequel?
I'd be a little more careful when eating that trail mix if I were you.
I see I'm not your only admirer, Mr. Audubon.
You should diversify your candy bar preferences. You smell like Mr. Peanut.
Oh,m that's how you tweet !
It's probably a good thing I'm immune to Avian Flew.
Feather allergy?
Alcatraz??
I don't think this is what your investors had in mind.
Better hurry before it's all gone!
Hey blue eyes, let's feed the ducks next.
You are going to need a license, Trump has said so.
Didn't you used to be Tippy Hedren?
Sometimes you have to find inspiration in real life, Hitchcock.
That reminds me. What ever happened to Tippi Hedren?
Do you know the muffin man?
You really have gone to seed, haven't you.
Maybe you should stop wearing that pigeon cologne.
By any chance... is your suit made of Duck ?
That's good luck for the next century.
Yeah, I tried Toast Cologne last week.
Oh dear... you bought non-gluten-free, did you?
It's sad to see so many illiterate birds.
How do you do it, Mr. Popcorn Man?
Is this like Trump and his Cabinet, "Birds of a feather flock together?"
These Trump tweets are really getting out of hand.
No. It's not that you mask yourself with seeds. It's that you don't ask the basic questions.
Those croissants from that new French bakery are really something, huh?
Would your name be Francis Assisi by any chance?
''Looks like your new suet is a big hit.''
Its the panko on the volcano roll.
I told you not to eat sesame seed bagels in Central Park.
Yeah, they love that all-natural hemp-fiber clothing.
Don't worry, they just eat the scabs.
Yes, life is like a box of chocolates.. unless you are coated in bird seed.
Are you a Hitchcock fan?
Like which one, you said? 'Marnie'? 'The Thirty-Nine Steps'? 'Jamaica Inn'? ...
Frankly, I always thought 'The Birds' was a bit far fetched. I stand corrected.
I told you to stop tweeting.
Finally going to seed!
No one likes books anymore.
You weren't lying when you said you were a chick magnet.
I can't believe they went for the g-free bread!
You should probably put away those sunflower seeds.
Ladies and Gentlemen, this man is for the birds.
Donald, your bird-brain party is getting out of hand.
Weird. I was just reading about a guy consumed by birds...
I THINK THE PIGEONS LIKE YOU!
I'm jumping ahead to my overview and summary.
Bob?
So much for birds of a feather!
Late night at the Bates Motel?
Forget the suit, can you breathe?
So Mr. Hitchcock, have any new film ideas?
They don't seem fake, Mr. President.
Did you tell them it's gluten-free?
Oh, it's called 'How To Attract Birds' . Are you interested?
Mr. Hitchcock, I think I have an idea for your next movie.
Oh, no, the billings fine. But could you hold down the cooing a bit?
Oh REAL mature Denise, giving me the cygnet treatment.
Rodgers, the cannonball is not an officially sanctioned board dive.
Aren't you in that Home Alone movie?
Let me guess: mama always said 'never let life turn into a Hitchcock movie,' eh Einstein?
I just feel like you've changed ever since your start-up received that seed investment.
I guess that's how the bird flu originated.
Do you ever get the feeling that you've wasted your life?
I was wrong. Suet isn't French for "sweet fragrance."
That's what you get for sitting over there like a statue.
Michaels love of sunflower seed smoothie's turns ugly. #The Vegan years.
I believe Hitchcock beat you to the idea........
I'm waiting for Dorothy too.
Could I have one feather for a bookmark?
Hay, I got it...have them pick you up and fly you home.
So you're the cuckoo's nest.
I told you a suit made out of bread was a terrible idea.
Let me guess! You're Alfred Hitchcock?
I think you said you used Irish Feather cologne to attract chicks?
You remind me of a Hitchcock film I watched recently---what was that title???
New diet, huh?
It's only supposed to be two turtle doves
Why did you spill breadcrumbs on yourself?
Hey, guy, knock off the bird calls.
Ho, Al Hitchkock from the grave.
Hitchcock's writing can be so vivid at times
Buddy, the trendy exfoliator is kitty litter - not suet.
If it's any consolation, I guess birds of a feather really do flock together.
It's an honor to meet you, Ms. Hedren. How's Alfred?
How long have you been a seedy character?
Never say, "flock off" to an ornithologist.
I prefer goose down.
Some kind of bird nip?
Excuse me, might you be related to the founder of the Audubon Society?
MAYBE YOU SHOULD CHANGE COLOGNES, YOURS SEEMS TO BE CONFUSED WITH CHICKS AND PIGEONS
You must of read "The Claw of Attraction".
You know you are only allowed 140 tweets!
Yup, you've been flocked.c
Stop tweeting!
No, I don't think it was called "The Bad Seeds.'
I told you not to wear that wormskin suit...
I love New Wave too.
I didn't know you were such a player.
Critique me harshly for reading "The Manchurian Candidate"? Looks like someone else's ideas & actions have finally found their final resting place.
Are you sure your tailor understood you wanted a Burred Suede suit?
I told you three weeks ago you needed to wash your clothes.
You seem to have more characters than allowed on your twitter feed.
Dude, your Twitter feed is blowing up.
What fabric did you say your clothes were made from??
Apologies. I almost moved to another bench after pigeon-holing you as the unattractive, unsavory type.
You know Brenda, I'm beginning to grow concerned that I misunderstood when you said you 'You have a lot of twitter followers.'
Wearable art?
But I don't think of you as a seedy character.
Let me guess; you have carrier pigeon e-mail cell phone service?
Damm it Fred! I told you not to eat in the park.
Nice to see you again Mr. Feather.
From an ornithological standpoint, New Orleans to New York is an atypical migration route for Columba livia domestica. Perhaps their traditional perches disappeared?
Says here you shouldn't move.
I'm a great admirer of your work, Ms. Hedren.
Peace be with you, Mr. President.
I told you to avoid the suet cologne!
Haven't you yet determined the airspeed velocity of an unladened swallow?
Looks like you chose the organic seed-based outdoors line at Patagonia.
What is that aftershave?
Don't worry. We're just filming a live-action Angry Birds movie.
There's a dry cleaner just down the street.
Would you like me to call the Emergency Bread Hotline?
If my name was 'Birdsall' I think I'd change it.
So what cologne are you wearing?
I know a terrific dry cleaner.
No, there's nothing in the Audubon book to explain it.
I find wearing hemp does that.
I've heard about snowstorms like this one. Just sayin'.
'Idiot's guide to pigeonholes.' I'm smack in the middle.
You were warned: Bird Weed would be that popular!
It's that Jerry Garcia Red Milo tie you're wearing.
The rumors are true. There is a bird man of Central Park!
Probably not a good idea to carry that bird seed in your pockets.
Just that kind of day, huh?
You are one seedy individual.
How's that human statue class going?
Now you're giving peace too much of a chance.
I think the invasion of the pigeons scare is a lot of crap.
Nothin' but bluebirds all day long.
This bench seems a little seedy.
Did you peace them?
The I??Bird scent will wear off on a few hours.
Yeah, I believe a warning went out about this a few days ago. I guess you didn't see it...
This is what happens when you say Donald Trump is a good president
Those angry birds are so *real*.
Damn democrats. Now we have to get the bench cleaned.
I know I should join the Audubon Club. Don't rub it in.
That wasn't a dog whistle, was it?
Hey come on now, guys--I thought I was higher in the pecking order!
Maybe you shouldn't have said you were going to sue it so loudly...
Now do you believe me, Alex, that your nut and seed diet is a little extreme?
Tom Lehrer, I presume.
It's easier to feed them, than to clean up afterwards.
They must smell your bird...
Eating bird food again?
Glad you like birds, not alligators.
Step 2: Release the bird seed.
The good news is they aren't after your candy bar. The bad news is they think you're a statue.
Wow Mr. Hitchcock, I will never think of you the same way!
Fortunately they're not carnivorous, but they certainly crap a lot.
What laundry do you use?
You must be a politician--all that fowl play.
Did you ever do time at Alcatraz?
Hey, Donald, time to stop your incessant tweeting!
A Taste of Honey Perhaps?
Sorry, it's suddenly noisy now; what was that you said about working in aviary pheromone research?
I think it's smoke that follows beauty.
Chocolate?
This book is for the birds.
That's Nuts !!
You should have brought a book not a sandwich.
Switching to email saved my life.
You should try giving up carbs.
So a pb&j on bird seed bread today?
And what do they do in return?
Did you know that suit from Vegan.Com was made out of bird seed?
It's probably not a good idea to eat a sesame seed bun around here.
It says here if you take 3 pills with a glass of lemonade, in 24 hours the worms are history!
No, I haven't seen the movie ~ and I don't believe you're Tippi Hedren!
You were warned about this, Mr. Capistrano.
So how is your all grain diet working out ? feel like there are any xtra benefits to it ??
My g-d, you really meant it was for the birds!
I told you to change after eating croissants.
