It's amazing to think he started out in the lobby.
Before we start, would anyone else like some water?
He got his start in the lobby.
...and I'll need an office with a window.
Ten bucks says he mentions 'sustainable growth'
Don’t look so surprised people…this IS a hedge fund
I thought we were moving all of our plants to Mexico.
It looks like Millennials are out and Perennials are in...
I thought all our plants moved to Mexico.
What I said was, "We need a plan."
I never thought I be happy to have a Bush in charge again.
They brought him in from the outside.
Keep tabs on the boss. I suspect he is a plant … a Manchurian Cannabis who's been rain-washed.
I bet he got the office with a window sill.
You're probably wondering how I called you all here.
You couldn't be any worse than the previous Bush.
I preferred the elder Bush.
Five years ago she was just a branch manager
Finally, a CEO who doesn't suck all the oxygen out of the room.
I think he was more effective as a branch manager.
We hired him to appeal to perennials.
I hear she pollinated her way to the top.
These are not the paid leaves I was hoping for.
He worked his way from the ground up.
Be patient. He'll grow on you.
Before the election I would have said he was under-qualified.
He worked his way from the ground up.
I thought we only hired Ivy League
Don't worry. He'll be out by the end of Autumn...
Just a friendly reminder, no dogs allowed at the company picnic.
Just last week I was adorning the lobby of Trump Tower. Now I'm the new Secretary of the Interior.
Who swiped my watering can, and WHO CHANGED THE BOY-GIRL, BOY-GIRL SEATING ??
Well he can't be worse than the last Bush...
He can't really answer any questions about the annual report -- he's a perennial.
He's the branch manager.
Here comes the talk again about remembering our roots.
You can call me Herb.
Let's all welcome Herb, our new plant manager.
Look who got the window office.
All memos will now be refered to as leaflets
Good afternoon. Today we'll be discussing our hedge funds.
I have to admit it, replacing Mr. Trump was not that difficult.
She's been in a vegetative state since the election.
All he talks about is growth.
Apparently, he's here to provide a much-needed breath of fresh air.
Let's not forget I worked my way from the ground up.
He's the new branch manager.
He worked his way up from the reception desk.
I think we were all expecting a little more growth this quarter.
This is our new plant manager.
Same agenda as last week -- root causes, stem cell research, and leaves of absence.
It could be worse. Moses took orders from a burning bush.
He's from an Ivy League school.
Careful what you say. I think he's a plant.
As your new CEO, my first executive decision is to move our table next to the window.
We're going paperless, effective immediately.
Please welcome our new Hedge Fund manager.
I think it's time we open more branches
When he said we were meeting about the new plant, this wasnt what I expected...
Given recent events, another bush being in charge doesn't seem so bad.
I am offering you all the opportunity to invest in my hedge fund.
Perhaps you could wipe that smirk off your face, Elaine, and tell us all what is so amusing about the fact that I did indeed soil myself...
I think he got to this position through graft.
He started from the ground up.
He started as a branch manager.
They said they were sending over a new plant manager.
I hear he interned at a hedge fund.
Let me clear the air: although technically a Millennial and a shrub, I do self-identify as a Perennial.
Actually, we've never had anyone ask for a glass ceiling before.
And despite all the dirt he still became CEO.
When you said you'd take "any Bush" over Trump, you could've been more specific.
It wasn't me. I only pass oxygen.
I move we smoke it.
Meteoric rise. He started on a secretary's desk.
Say what you will , but he is the best plant manager we have ever had
Ladies, and Gentlemen, I represent the hedge fund that just bought you out."
Housekeeping accidentally leaves a plant in the CEO’s chair – 4th quarter profits soar and senior staff note a vast improvement in the quality of executive meetings.
What's the dirt on the new guy?
Next item – company holidays: Labor Day is out and Arbor Day is in.
Another Ivy League chairman?
Of course HE gets the window office with the good sun.
The good news is by moving it to the south side of the table, we have seen a lot more growth.
Everyone told us not to worry-----this could never happen.
Allow me to clear the air.
You're probably wondering how I called you all here.
My roots in this company go deep and I look forward to sunnier days ahead.
Just like you, I want to make this transition as organic as possible.
The company welcomes its new CEO, who narrowly defeated a woman for the position.
Please allow me to take a moment to explain the many November-April gaps on my résumé.
Finally, someone who doesn't suck the oxygen out of our meetings.
Another President Bush?
I thought we moved all of our plants to China."
Honestly, I never thought it would get elected
Are we still moving the plant to Mexico?
We began with a little seed money... look at us now.
Before we begin may I have a glass of water?
You've gotta hand it to him. He sucks the carbon dioxide out of the room.
Careful what you say, I think he is a corporate plant.
I’d like to see us double our CO2 emissions by the end of next quarter.
He manages a ton of other branches, too.
God not another Bush
Sadly, no, it's not the most insane thing I've seen this week.
That's the new plant manager.
Bush recommended him.
I've seen him standing around in corners here and there, but I had no idea he was the plant manager.
Daddy was a hedge fund.
When they said this meeting was going to be about the new plant, I'd imagined something quite different.
The chair has the flora.
I'd like you to meet our plant manager
You can't get rid of me that easily, people. I'm a perennial.
I see you've turned my father into a table
I will miss you all. I have been appointed Trump's Secretary of Agriculture.
I suppose you're wondering how I called you all here today.
It may be our annual meeting, but it's a perennial problem.
He used to run a branch office
We're expecting significant growth.
I want all reports on my windowsill before noon.
Annual meeting with the plant supervisor
Just call me Herb.
Coffee all around, and water the chairman.
Another biodiversity hire.
...and I'll need your suggestions before autumn.
I think this guy's a plant.
I give him six months. Less if we forget to water him.
Apparently he's one of the Bush family.
As you are all aware, I am a big fan of hedge funds"
I thought Phil O. Dendron was an alias.
We anticipate significant growth in the second quarter
She manages our hedge fund.
I have soiled myself.
I can't stop thinking he might be a plant.
Here comes the annual's report.
Obviously a plant.
That would explain the Miracle-Gro in the vending machines.
Looks like they've brought the Bush administration back.
As you can see, I am fully qualified to be your new plant manager.
Welcome, plant managers
I wish I had been nicer to it in the elevator coming up.
Apparently he came up in a hedge fund.
Well, why not? The last CEO was just nuts.
Which bathroom will you use?
He favors hedging.
Millennials might support this idea but perennials will not.
So, is this your first ficus group?
He declined direct compensation..... but did request indirect sunlight.
You're probably wondering how I asked you all to this meeting...
I wonder what his second wish would have been. . .
Be careful what you say; I think he's a plant.
Who wants to be my new Branch Manager?
Of course he got the promotion -- he's got dirt on everyone.
Be careful what you say; I think he's a plant.
OK, we've gone green. Now what ?
She uprooted her family for this job.
Before we start, does anyone else need more water?
He's planning a hosta takeover.
Ten years on the job, Johnson, and you still haven't blossomed.
It's as if Donald never left
Be respectful. He was just elected President.
My main objective here is growth.
He's not even Ivy League.
Can you really be Chairman when you're still illegal in 22 states?
Maybe he'll grow into the job.
He's a little green for a CEO.
Suddenly having a bush in charge didn't seem so bad.
He's only here because his father is this table.
So much for machines taking over the world.
Meet our new branch manager.
I heard that he was involved in some graft in his past.
When I suggested that a little pot might help us think better, this wasn't what I had in mind.
I think he's a bit green to be running a company.
Who knew he was a pothead?
First off, anyone thirsty? Need more light?
I think he's full of fertilizer.
I'm being transferred to our field office.
This new guy looks like he is straight from the nursery.
Well, this looks promising...his dad was a real stick in the mud.
And this is a scale model of our new plant.
Not another Bush.
Can we get you something...coffee, water, light?
I think he's a plant from Corporate.
He's a seasonal employee.
So, are we just going to stare at it or are we going to smoke it already?
Before we get started, anyone need water?
I'm glad I voted for legalization.
Finally, leadership that doesn't suck all the oxygen from the room.
The good news is I've experience 20% growth in the last quarter.
Obviously, this guy is a corporate plant.
We're sorry sir. We just don't think the country is ready for another Bush presidency.
He always sucks all the oxygen out of the room.
He's keeping his promise to bring back plants that went overseas.
Well, at least we've broken the grass ceiling.
Never saw it coming, all our data pointed to a Hosta takeover.
Have we pushed diversity too far?
Give him some time, he might grow into the position.
A few years ago he was just a plant manager.
He's our new plant manager!
We've brought in a growth specialist.
I guess this means there won't be a salad option for lunch.
New growth is very important to me.
What he lacks in charisma, he makes up for with several key nutrients.
Anybody not finishing their water?
I could see myself growing here.
He was pruned for this
All those in favor of adding Arbor Day to our holiday schedule, say aye.
Remember when we promised to elect the company geranium president when the Cubs win the Series?
We're looking for seed money.
I'd like to start with everyone taking a deep breath and exhaling toward me....
--and yet, we get more done than Congress.
We should watch what we say around him. I think he's a plant.
Don't worry, she'll grow on you.
He's a plant from corporate.
Another blooming idiot!
Maybe he'll grow in office.
I worked my way up from the mailroom windowsill.
Before we start the meeting, I'd like to take a moment of silence to reflect and photosynthesize.
Does anyone else need water?
He gave most of the seed money.
He changed his title from COO to CO2.
10 bucks says the next vote is about either sunlight or water.
Sorry I'm late, but compost happens.
Frankly, I would have preferred a woman.
Excellent growth this quarter!
I always breathe a little easier when he's around.
Be careful, he may be a plant.
Watch what you say, it could be a plant from corporate.
He's supposed to be an expert on growth.
Probably one of those Ivy Leaguers.
See what an Ivy League education can do for you?
I've will not tolerate anymore talk of "moving the plant overseas."
Intel strongly suspects that one of us in this room is a plant.
They say the CEO hand-picked him.
Nepotism. His father's the head of the plant.
I've called you here today to explain why we have not yet filled the position of Plant Manager.
I'm so glad we didn't elect another old white guy.
Well, they always did say a potted plant could do the job.
He worked his way up from plant manager.
They don't call this a hedge fund for nothing.
Did anybody remember to bring the rolling papers?
Just imagine what we could do with more seed money
As you can see, third quarter growth has been strong.
I hear he came from a hedge fund
When I started here, I was just a plant manager.
Careful what you say. He may be a plant.
You think I'm successful? My Dad's a hedge fund!
Who knew when I said a potted plant could do a better job, I'd be right?
Alright folks, that should wrap it up. Would one of you turn my chair toward the window on the way out?
The hedge funds are moving in.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to thank you again for participating in this ficus group.
The ficus group loved him.
It seems leadership has become a perennial problem!
All in favor of more natural light say "aye".
"Are we sure this is what a decision tree is? '
I wonder if this is about a hedge fund.
Why am I the only one focused on growth?
Watch what you say. It may be a plant.
Here's the deal--you give me carbon dioxide, I give you oxygen.
I'd like to report another quarter of growth
I'll begin by thanking all my colleagues in the branch office.
No coffee for me, just a water and indirect sunlight would be great.
I'm definitely committed to solar.
He's the new branch manager.
The decision was unanimous--you're the new plant manager.
I was skeptical at first, but he's starting to grow on me.
He is responsible for the seed money.....
I knew it...it's a hosta takeover.
- "Whatever you say, don't question his roots."
Focus group? Looks like a ficus group to me.
I hear he wants to open a new Branch
At least he doesn't suck all the oxygen from the room.
It was supposed to be a joke—but this is what we voted for.
Now that I've cleared the air, let's move on to new business.
No one thought to get me some water, seriously?
He doesn't look like much, but they say he really knows hedge funds.
Are you kidding me? There's another BUSH in charge?
What does he mean when he says it's time to 'prune staff'?
Enough about me - let's discuss the other branches.
Should we offer him some water?
We're going paperless.
The name's O'Dendron. But, you can call me Phil.
Nominate the fern, you said. It will be funny, you said.
I wouldn't have voted for it if I had actually thought it would win....
No, YOU tell him he has aphids.
Well, at least he is not sucking all the oxygen out of the room.
So anything can become President?
I’ve decided to leave to start a hedge fund.
We haven’t seen this kind of growth in years.
It figures. Anything but a woman in charge.
Yes, it is time to discuss hedge funds.
I'm a perennial not a millennial.
He's going to bore us again with the story of how he worked his way up from plant manager.
It's been pruned. That must mean cutbacks.
Magna cum laude, Trump University.
It shouldn't take much digging to find some dirt on this one.
This explains the quick change over to full spectrum lighting.
At least it's not a Bush!
Who else wants water?
Uh oh. Here come the perennial cutbacks.
It was a struggle, but I broke the grass ceiling.
The problem, sir, is you. We elected you to a five-year term but you're an annual.
Maybe he'll grow into the position.
Let me guess....growth.
Just call me Herb.
Well at least we got rid of the dead wood.
Not the meteoric-rise-from-office-decor speech again.
I've been out in the field much too long.

Think of me as another Bush running for president.
One of you will be my next plant manager.
Get ready for the "hedge our bets" joke again.
Let's never forget that this company was started with seed money.
and they said we had to worry about the robots taking over
Don't say anything. I think it's a plant.
My sources tell me that he comes potted to every meeting.
Eventually, the mix-up was discovered. Mr. Fitzgerald was found in the corner of his office, freshly watered, and away from direct sunlight.
He really brings a breath of fresh air to the office.
He's just a placeholder until we find someone willing to put down roots.
Now, before we start, could someone please get me some water?
I'd like to start this meeting by asking one of you to pass me a glass of water.
It's not a nightmare, we actually elected him.
We can't keep moving our plants to Mexico.
Pssst...I keep forgetting. Is our boss an annual or a perennial?

Here at FTD, we have a somewhat different view of diversity.
Good morning...I'm your new plant manager.
I think he might be a plant.
I''m sure you're all wondering why you've brought me here.

Before we start, can I get a little water?
Can I get you some water?
Don't hold your breath, he needs the CO2.
C'mon people, am I the only one photosynthesizing here?
Give her credit. She worked hard and broke through the grass ceiling.
Ficus group
Looks like the company finally decided to go green.
We need to start trimming the staff.
Still a better leader than Trump.
We used to be run by big tobacco.
Given the outcome, another bush looks pretty good
I guess that's one way to clear the air.
I just love having an office full of humans. It's so colorful and adds carbon dioxide to the air.
The Bush Administration
Certainly looks smarter than our last CEO.
One day you're at the head of the table, the next you are the table.

We're going paper-free

I can't believe he came to the board meeting potted.
And that's the miracle of the secret ballot

Before we begin, I would like to thank you all for legalizing me.
As plant manager, I’d like to discuss the possibility of investing in hedge funds.

I hear he wants to call it a perennial report.
When I grow, we grow. It's that simple.
I wonder who's going to be the new plant manager.
Management's been pushing perennial growth.
Psst . . . It's time for the annuals report.
I must admit, I do see plenty of growth opportunities
I mean, are we the Board, or are we branch managers?
No coffee, just water with a touch of fertilizer.
I hope this meeting's not bugged.
Before we get started, can we get you some water?
Can't anyone remember the magic word?
I guess we should cancel that salad order for lunch.
I guess the rumors that I heard about this company going to pot were true
The last guy was axed.
He was obviously planted.
You're all fired.
Even Monsanto couldn't have seen this coming.
I think if we moved her closer to the window she might grow into the job.
I'd appreciate it if we can move this chat to the water cooler.
Hope it's pot.
This year I want to focus on growth.
What is the plant manager up to now?
I am the executive branch.
So is this part of our sustainability initiative or our diversity campaign?
Our shareholders were complaining about a lack of biodiversity on the board.
The first order of business is ensuring this company becomes a paperless office
Well, this should get the environmentalists off our backs.
I don't trust him. I think he's a plant.
Hail to the leaf.
Have you met the new plant manager?
What? I thought you all wanted to discuss ficus responsibility.
Be careful, I think she's a plant.
Our nation has its POTUS. We have our FICUS.
Try to use gender neutral pronouns.
You were right, no difference
It's time for the company to branch out.
How much greener can our company get?
We're going to make America so green again. So green. You won't believe how green I'll make it.
If you thought I was joking when I said that I want this company to be greener, I wasn't.
I want to branch out.
They warned us there was no telling what might happen if we legalized it.
I'm never sure when the meeting is over.
It won the electoral vote.
Talk to me.
We'd like to welcome Carl, the new Plant Manager.
We needed a committee member with a negative carbon footprint!
Capacity for growth is something we look for in our senior managers.
just call me basil
They brought in a perennial after losing two CFOs to frost.
Don't trust him, he's a plant.
It's not what he says. It's what he leaves out.
She broke the grass ceiling...
Maybe, just maybe, it's time to start thinking "Inside the Box" again.
I'm from the branch office...
First order of business, paperless office.
I always suspected Henry was a plant
Now People.. I just want to remind you what happened in the film "Little Shop of Horrors".
Good afternoon. I am your new branch manager.
I told you his virulent veganism was going to change him.
I am stepping down today to begin my campaign for president.
It'll be fine as long as he surrounds himself with good people.
In the interest of greater efficiency, we've decided to move the plant closer to corporate.
I started this company as a little seedling...
His ambitions seems a little too dependent on solar.
Isn't he taking this idea of going green a bit too far?
His ideas are growing on me.
That's weird. The head of the table is putting oxygen back in the room.
I still think he's a plant.
Our new boss looks pretty green.
Is it just me, or is this company going to pot?
new rule - no more paper
He's the type that kind of grows on you!
It's possible we've gone too green.
The chairman has decided to go green.
You want to know how I got to the top? One word: FERTILIZER.
Tell me you didn't vote green.
I can provide the seed money your company needs to grow.
Look who's in a good mood. He must have upped his nitrogen this morning.
We need to nip this in the bud.
Well he did create a successful start-up with just one cup of water.
Our security has been breached. In other words, one of you is a plant.
He's our first CEO with support from all the branches.
As the CEO, we're still waiting for him to blossom.
Honestly, it hadn't even occurred to me that the greenhouse had a glass ceiling.
Don't even think about making a plant manager joke.
They say he has deep roots in the South.
It's an inspired choice for the head of the EPA. Green but not confrontational.
I'm afraid it's time for some pruning.
If I hear one more "Blame it on Bush" joke, you're all fired.
How about we try smoking some of it.
Let's all take a step back and photosynthesize the situation.
Who do I have to fire to get a glass of water around here?
I move we begin going paperless.
Solar, I like it.
Everything's going to pot.
I’m green, but I have deep roots in hedging strategy.
I anticipate first quarter growth.
Just think, he started as plant manager.
The card said it needs a place of importance with lots of direct praise.
I heard he left his old firm because of a pot problem.
He he goes again. Sucking all of the oxygen out of the room.
Yes, I'm the new CEO, COO, majority stockholder and a philodendron. But you can call me Phil.
The Board's commitment to diversity knew no bounds.
Actually Larry, I'm sucking the carbon dioxide from the room.
.....And from now on, we're going to be paperless.
The boss took going green to a whole new level.
Shall I ask him if he'd like some water?
In my place, Mr. Townsend has been permanently assigned to the lobby.
In retrospect, the board members should have anticipated the impending hosta takeover.
Isn't he a bit green to be CEO?
No ideas? It's like someone sucked the oxygen out of here.
So.... when is it supposed to start burning?
I want you to think outside the pot.
Thank you all for your attention - and carbon dioxide.
"And Johnson, if you forget to water me again before you go on vacation, don't bother coming back!
Call the witch back. Tell her I apologize.
At least this CEO won't suck the oxygen out of the room
Let me guess. He wants to open more plants.
Let's start by clearing the air.
Can someone get me a glass of water?
The stockholders want growth and profitability. What's profitability?
Before we start, I'd like to say that's a nice pruning, Sir.
Fern, you had something to say?
As CEO and Chairman I oppose this talk about plant closings
The awkward silence as they meet the new branch manager.
Looks different, but the IQ is the same
We've seen slow but consistent growth.
Yeah, mine says the same thing, "Come meet the new plant manager".
I understand some of you suspect I am a plant.
He always talked about going green
Our former chairman was supplanted.
Let's talk growth strategy.
First off, I would like to apologize for my getting potted at the office party.
Is this the best candidate The Green Party could come up with?
He's ambitious all right, but I'm not sure the country can take another bush.
Can we concentrate on the low-hanging fruit?
On behalf of our entire company, I extend a warm welcome to our new plant manager.
Increase our bonuses? Do I look like a Money Tree to you?
Have you had a chance to leaf through our proposal?
I think he's a plant from our competition.
Can we please take this meeting outside?
Is it me, or does it feel like we're stuck in perennial meetings these days?
At least this one makes oxygen.
Watch what you say. They think there's a plant in the office.
Wow... He actually is a potted plant.
You, with the stupid look on your face, water me.
At least the new guy adds oxygen to the room instead of sucking it out like the last guy.
What do you mean exactly when you say the company is "going green"?
This quarter I would like to continue my growth strategy.
I hear that he's a perennial winner.
Our boss is the strong, silent phenotype
Boss's new plan sounds like a bonsai scheme.
I want you all to leave!
I realize that I may not be the plant manager you expected.
Just having him in the room makes me breathe more easily.
We were skeptical, but have to admit that you grew on us
I can't believe she was really saying "Hosta-style takeover".
I was brought in to breathe some fresh air into the company.
Don't say anything you don't want made public. I think he's a plant.
I think we're taking boardroom diversity a bit far
She started on the reception desk and gradually just took over the whole company.
I'll be entering stasis soon, and Simmons, you'll be in charge.
Let's do introductions. I'll start. My name is Fern.
Be careful what you say...I hear he's a plant...
Bush 2020
Speaking as your GMO, I'm increasing the illumination and humidity in our facility.
It's not ideal, but the other candidate had an issue with emails.
I told you the new CEO was a plant.
We must assume this is an indication that we're going green
He really sucks the oxygen out of these meetings, doesn't he?
Firstly, I'd like to thank our previous branch manager
Looks like I'll be trading in my brown nose for a green thumb"
Why the hell are we sitting here staring at a plant?
Let's talk about our branches.
Good morning...I'm your new plant manager.
I don't know if I can go that green.
I think we've taken our green initiative too far.
Word is that he is a plant from corporate.
Going forward all job cuts will be referred to as "pruning".
It would be many years before they could have an actual board meeting.
Be careful what you say, I think the new guy's a plant.
Twenty bucks he wants to build more plants.
I knew he was a plant.
: “Watch what you say. I’m pretty sure he’s a plant.”
He's our new plant manager!
You can all breathe easier now that I'm in charge.
He’s not as green as he looks.
This is not what I would call, 'staying true to our roots'.
The executive team carefully surveyed the new plant manager
A GMO CEO.
Watch what you say -- I think one of these folks is a plant.
First Trump. Now me. Some people will elect anything.
He certainly has grown in the job.
I hope he remembers when I used to polish his leaves.
Of course, he's got insider info on the competition. He's a plant.
It was a fair election. Now what?
As your new plant manager I want to thank each of you for all your hard work.
Whose turn was it to bring the coffee and miracle grow?
Our company couldn't send a more positive message than having our first Green CEO
And Johnson, for the last time, stop staring at my pot...my leaves are up here!
Just like him to plant himself at the head of the table.
Anybody else thirsty?
Reincarnation doesn't always go as planned.
Board meetings are so much more enjoyable now that marijuana is legal.
It's the plant he promised would bring jobs to Detroit.
Anybody in here read Kafka?
Who's going to tell him he's naked?
After his failed Presidential bud, Mr. Bush will be joining our board of directors.
Poor J. R., I heard it all started with a simple case of plantar fasciitis.
could someone switch seats with me? I need the southern light
Our final candidate has demonstrated groundbreaking skills.
The board immediately regretted the blind hiring of another Ivy League grad.
I know some of you have doubts, but as I grow into the position, I look forward to our achieving great success.
You didn't believe me when I said we were going green.
You sure that's the only Bush available these days?
Our company has gone to pot.
She adds to our diversity, yet decreases our carbon footprint.
Shh! He's a plant.
Actually I thought our Chairman Bush was a real person...
The final candidates were this or Donald Jr.
Careful, I hear he's a plant...
Our executive branch is leaving.
I would like us to focus more on growth
Going green was always a goal of his.
You all know my deeply-rooted views on this matter.
Our new plant manager seems a little green.
First order of business. I want a glass of water.
He looked taller in the photo.
This is what we get for voting independent.
Careful what you say...rumor is, this new guy is a plant.
I guess his ex-wife was a real witch after all.
I hear it's artificial.
She just planted herself there.
Our CEO may seen a bit different, but he'll grow on you.
The doctors said it's the worst case of persistent vegetative state they've seen.
Now we'll hear from our Plant Manager
Dear god, he heard it through the grapevine.
He's really grown as a leader.
Are you OK, boss? You're looking a little green.
The new CEO is serious about carbon emissions.
I am sure he will clear the air.
It's not easy being green!
Did you have a chance to leaf through the report?
Those who called our chairman dumber than a potted plant know who they are.
The company decided to increase the biodiversity of the workforce.
Be careful what you say. I'm pretty sure he's a plant.
whose going to tell him about the mealybug on his lapel...
Please welcome our new leader, President Bush.
It was thought he could breathe some fresh air into the company.
Why is everyone staring at me as if I'm the root of the problem
Here at Rainbow Analytics we pride ourselves on a management team that hails from every race, gender, sexuality, religion and soil type.
I guess the company is serious about going green.
So tell me, what do you think of the new plant manager?
First order of business - Bunyan, you're fired!
Let's just move our office to Denver so we can smoke it.
I'm from our California office. Relax, just take a deep breath and inhale.
I don't think this is what the Board meant by "going green."
This will be a new kind of leadership, one firmly rooted in the very soil of America.
Is it bugged?
Do I have a volunteer to take me home for the weekend?
I thought we were meeting George H.W. Bush.
So that's 10 garden salads and a t-bone?
Well, he's been threatening to leave for years.
I think he's a plant.
At least he doesn't suck all the air out of the room.
Here comes the "let's go green pitch" again.
I'm thinking salad for lunch.
The board has spoken. I’ve been pruned.
You don't get a vote on climate change, sir.
First an empty suit, now a potted plant.
At the end of the day the only color that matters is green.
Be careful what you say around him... I think he's a plant.
I may be green, but I can handle the job.
The chair has the flora.
Now that's what I call a power plant
Marijuana won in every state....
I'd like you all to welcome the new branch manager.
He got that position by letting everyone else do the talking.
Dare you to ask for a show of hands.
He’s definitely presidential material.
Let's make this quick. I have a housewarming party to get to.
He sure has grown a lot in this position but I wonder if this is the year he finally blooms.
Our leadership has gone to pot.
At his first meeting Herb had everyone's undivided attention.
I think we've found the root of the problem.
'what new branches had you in mind ,Mr Chairman "
Let's take a moment to synthesize this information
Yes, we agree, even a Bush would have been a better choice.
He's such a good listener.
Let's not water him and see what happens.
First, I want to address the rumors that I photosynthesized my way to the top.
Marty did say that his vacation was going to be completely transformative.
Never again will anyone in this company reach for the low hanging fruit.
It's time we branch out.
Ironic that no one thought to bring him water.
I for one oppose any policy that would limit CO2.
It worked its way up from the mailroom.
Great. Another plant from the board.
Could someone please pass me some water?
How long before someone supplants him?
He thinks that we should open up another branch.
Really? No one brought water?
Please stay. We're actually nostalgic for Bush leadership.
Could someone get me a glass of water?
First order of business, water me.
I move that we take it outside.
Usually these meetings are like watching grass grow, but finally a fresh face.
I guess he was serious about going green.
She's full of fertilizer.
I call to order this Board of Directors Meeting of Plant Parenthood.
He just sits there like a potted plant.
You see now the hazard in allowing the stockholders to vote.
Before you can be a board you have to be a tree.
I told you legalizing marijuana was a slippery slope.
Should we eat it or smoke it?
'Her roots are showing."
We all need to get back to our roots.
First order of business: the salad bar has been causing me some concern.
Unfortunately, Fern could not make it today.
How did this transpire?
Uhhh...what, exactly, is a "Perennial Report?"
I feel like we need more biodiversity
Sure he's an Ivy League ficus, I'm just saying he's still too green to be CFO.
I know, but at least it's not Trump.
It's a meeting to elect a new plant manager.
I would personally like to address the problem of employees taking too many unauthorized leaves.
The CEO has been supplanted.
Herb's the perennial late bloomer.
I blame the electoral college.
I think our CEO is potted.
Okay, so maybe 'strong roots, branch experience, growth potential, eco-sensitive' left a little to the imagination.
I want to talk about security. I think one of us is a plant.
We're sorry. The board feels you've outgrown this position.
Looks like management was serious about turning over a new leaf
We had to put a leaf in the table to accommodate everyone.
Any photosynthesis deniers?
And the first one to feed me horseshit will be fired!
So, with regrets, we've agreed to shut down the plant.
Previously front lobby of Trump Towers.
Just wait: he'll wilt.
We're with Fern
So what happened to the old plant manager?
Looks like he's turning over a new leaf.
Anybody bring any rolling papers?
The people wanted an outsider.
Jim, I'm afraid your plan just isn't bearing fruit.
One word, people. Water.
I think it is clear we have made a real breakthrough in biotech
Am I the only one capable of breathing new life into this company?
If only it were cannabis I wouldn't mind these meetings.
Salary was the deciding factor.
Our business is just too seasonal.
The company was undergoing a hosta takeover.
Let's get down to earth, people.
Could someone bring me a glass of water?
I think the new CEO is a GMO.
So this is the plant manager?
At least he cares more about the environment than Trump.
As to pronouns, "it" is perfectly acceptable. Now to the Human Resources Committee report - and we'll have to revisit that name as well - . . .
Watch what you say. He could be a plant.
I'm opening a new branch next week.
Anyone else feel like a little pot?
Not so loud - he's dormant.
We will not be moving the plant to Mexico.
Now I'm legal, and we can start helping all Americans to feel great again.
Bear with me as I leaf through the agenda.
Welcome to the inaugural Plant Parenthood meeting.
I would like to present my nominee for Agricultural Secretary.
When we elected Bush to be the new Chairman, I thought we meant George.
Our search firm's choice for plant manager?
I called you here today to inform you that our plant in Cleveland will be relocating to Mexico.
There was a time when you just couldn't get him to shut up.
All those in favor face the sun.
So that's what legal marijuana looks like.
Despite increased biodiversity on the board of directors, HR continued to receive complaints of asexual nature.
Between a woman and a potted plant they choose the f***ing plant.
I knew it was a bad idea to have write-in candidates.
I have the feeling that we voted for the wrong bush...
We need to start thinking about pruning our workforce.
I suggested our next CEO be fastidious, not deciduous.
Our new Plant Manager.
I feel like I could really grow here.
If he doesn't say something soon, I'm going to water him.
He got overwatered at the office party and tried to pollinate the HR director.
Sure he's a little green, but maybe he'll be around longer than his predecessor.
I had heard they were pruning the staff
Shhhhhhh , it's a plant.
The hiring manager said there was excellent potential for growth.
Another quarter of record growth.
Isn't the new guy a little green to be leading this meeting?
This company has apparently gone to pot.
Could everyone just exhale, please?
...I'm going to go out on a limb, here...
We get it sir...you want us to be more deeply rooted in the company.
Well, that explains the nursery merger.
I'd like to introduce our new plant manager.
"First order of business; Who here is a vegetarian?
I'm Leif, the new plant manager. Initially, we'll be dormant, but we anticipate significant growth in the spring.
What does he know about growing a business?
And what are you doing about your carbon foot print
I'm the potted plant you said you'd prefer to Bixby as your Chairman.
He's fern but fair.
As the new CEO, my first order is to replace the cafeteria salad bar with healthy water, sunlight, and manure options.
On Sarah's first day at work, she realized that she was the only one not wearing glasses.
I wasn't expecting this when they called a meeting of the top plant's employees...
Are you absorbing any of this?
Maybe now this company will take climate change seriously.
Be careful what you say. I think he might be a plant from headquarters.
Get ready for some serious pruning and trimming in every department.
I would rather be supervised by a solar panel.
A-fern-ative Action
Is it possible to go too green?
Bad news. We're out of seed money.
He's tough, but I hear his bark is worse than his bite.
So this is our new plant manager?
Our new plant manager will be chairing this meeting.
Let's start with introductions. I'm Fern.
There are rumors that our competitor has placed a plant inside our executive offices.
I see tremendous growth potential in the coming quarter.
I'd like to address the gross overuse of paper in this office.
He hasn't said much, but I think he'll grow on you.
Could one of you bring me some water?
We're getting back to our roots.
I preferred the stuffed shirt.
His management skills have really blossomed.
Some of you may consider this taking the ivy league too far.
As you know, my roots in this industry run deep.
I told you one day I'd be legal.
I've decided that we should have more branch offices.
We need to refocus on organic growth.
Everyone please remain seeded.
Now that corporations are considered people it's only fair...
I hate taking orders from someone so green.
It's the green candidate.
I wasn't kidding when I said we were going green.
We are going green, people.
Congratulations!Growth is good. We have four new branches, and are greener than ever!
With your help, we can continue to grow the hedge fund my father established.
One of us is a plant.
Is it narcissistic or just a narcissus?
This company's going to pot.
It grows on you.
All those in favor of recreational marijuana, say aye.
Is anyone else in R&D experiencing potential side effects, or am I the only one?
If he doesn't come back, he said to water it twice a week.
Business is blooming.
Before we begin, I'd like you all to take a deep breath out.
Is this about my CO2 emissions?
I'm thinking that this CEO may be a plant.
Not the George Bush I was expecting...
It's very clear that if our business is going to survive, we have to start branching out.
Careful what you say, he's a plant.
That's a Trump plant. It's gonna be Yuge!
Psst. I don't trust him. I heard he's a plant.
From now on, our meetings will be carbon neutral.
Same charisma as the old CEO.
In our last meeting you voted for a new plant.
Don't stare at me like I'm a potted plant. Somebody give me an answer!
Of course the new plant manager will be working very closely with me.
I thought you said he was a vegetarian, not vegetation.
All of these growth strategies involve indirect sunlight.
We can disagree about going green, but we have to agree he leads by example.
Allow me to introduce myself - I'm the new plant supervisor
We're downsizing. I've called in the Bonsai Team.
I say we don't water it
Let's hope that he grows into the job.
It looks like we've been targeted for takeover by FTD. You'd better read the card.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am proud to be the first shrub to shatter the grass ceiling.
No we can't draw the shades, I don't work that way.
He has no qualifications as chairman, but we felt he's the lesser of two evils.
We've recently discovered that our CEO is a Russian plant
It looks like they've drained the swamp.
He is very impatiens today.
Welcome to our first Green Lives Matter meeting.
Let's start the meeting with the annual, or the perennial, report.
He pretends to be down to earth, but his family's roots go way back.
He looks like he could use a drink.
This new boss seems kind of green.
Call security. I think we have a plant.
Ten bucks says this is going to be about soil conservation again.
Tell us about your growth plan.
As you may have expected, my successor will not be one of you.
She's from the branch office.
Not what I was expecting when I heard we we'd be unveiling a new plant..."
I heard he got his start in Chia Pets.
The first item on our agenda...going paperless.
So let's sell, sell, sell. And remember, it's a jungle out there.
First, let's address care and feeding of the Chair.
Is it sexual harassment if I picture our boss in a skinny little joint?
Today's meeting is about going paperless. Awkward.
Good, we all agreed again. It's manure for lunch.
I guess we're no longer beating around the bush.
I'd like to see more foliage on casual Fridays.
Don't trust him, he's a plant.
Perhaps letting the internet choose our new CEO was a mistake.
Is that the new plant manager?
Well, we planted a seed. Now what?
Tell me this isn't their idea of an "Ivy League" partner!
That Miracle Grow merger is going to be a top priority in 2017
Be careful what you say . She could be a plant .
Is it me, or does it feel like all the air was just sucked out of the room?
We need growth opportunities.
Growth this quarter has been disappointing.
who put miracle grow on the ashes?
This won't be the first time a bush screwed up this company.
Ever since the company went green there seems to be a real lack of leadership.
This wasn't what I had in mind when I heard we were meeting the new branch manager today.
Let's talk growth.
Let me introduce the new Plant Director.
First, I'd like to address the rumors that I'm having an inappropriate relationship with the orchid in the reception area.
Careful what you say, I suspect there's a plant among us.
Bush replaces Trump at climate talks.
Let's hear from the plant manager next.
Our latest projections call for growth in the spring.
Is he saying grow the business or go back to our roots?
Well, we elected him.
We've been had! He was a plant all along.
This quarter will be all about organic growth.
We'd like to congratulate you on your growth this quarter.
When the company hired a new 'Plant Manager' I had a somewhat different expectation.
When you said the CEO was a potted plant, I thought you just meant he was useless.
It was this or a woman as President.
No, YOU tell him he has aphids.
The new plant manager looks a bit green.
I love working for the power plant.
I think we've found the plant - now where's the mole?
We wanted to see the fiscal plan, not the ficus plant.
I knew she dyed her roots.
Didn't you ask for a new Plant Manager?
Obviously, seniority counts more than performance around here.
All in favor of smoking the Chairman...
Don't say too much- he might be a plant.
Looks like we have another Bush leading us!
Donald Trump's newly formed cabinet learns where oxygen comes from
Thank you for switching sides, Gary. I prefer to be near the window.
The firm wants to branch out.
The merger with Monsanto is now complete.
Who wants to tell Ivy that her attitude has poisoned this whole meeting?
So we went green. Now what?
He is organic, biodynamic and now legal in California, but almost impossible to interpret.
We are now officially a green company.
You guys are missing the forest for the tree.
I take my job as branch manager seriously
You suck the oxygen out of the room!
You think he's just going sit there and photosynthesize all day?
Due to a conflict of interest I recuse myself from our vote about the new branch.
He's an Ivy League whiz kid apparently.
His retirement package includes composting
All in favor of water for lunch say yeah.
The Monsanto annual meeting will now come to order.
First thing we're going to do, people, is make shrubs great again!
Effective immediately, we're opening more branch offices.
The committee for funding plant parenthood will come to order.
Effective immediately, we're going paperless.
I'm thinking a big salad for lunch.
"Let's hope he leaves early".
After all, he is the plant manager.
Hey Fern. what do you think about the apposing hedge fund.
I heard there were leeks in the department.
Transparency is fine, but I'll need indirect sunlight and bottled water too.
It's part of our green initiative.
I'll say one thing, he sure has inspired growth!
Unanimously agreed, we need a plant manager.
Call our plant manager.
We think he was sent here from the other company as a plant.
Finally a meeting that bares fruit.
Did I hear "There will be growth in the spring!" ?
I got this job because of roots in the community.
I've called you all here to be my eyes and ears...and arms and brains. In fact just run it the way you want
The branch office had great things to say about her, but I don't think she'll bear fruit.
Yes, he's a little green, but I think he's just the sort of leader this company needs.
First we grow the boss, then we grow the company.
His speech is rather flowery too.
OK, ladies and gentlemen, here's how it works: I make the oxygen for you, you make the carbon dioxide for me. We're a team! We're Photosynthesis! Any questions?
I like it. The listening is about the same but it talks a lot less.
Don't let it see you eating a salad.
He's a bit green, isn't he?
20 years ago I was an an illegal plant, now I'm president

He hasn't shown us much so far, but we expect him to really bloom in the Spring.
We've finally gone green.
I don't know, he seems a little green.
We're expecting record growth this year
...and maybe Trump will be effective as president
I wanted people who are ruthless, not rootless.
We've voted you out. You never really were one of us.
Okay. Who's the mole?
She's an expert on green energy.
We promised our investors a new chairman and new plant.
" I didn't ask for this reincarnation." "What's on the agenda"?

Don't look surprised. I have deep roots going back long before any of you.
Our new CEO is committed to green initiatives....
I prefer it to Trump.
I propose we invest in shrubbery as a hedge against inflation.
I call our perennial board meeting to order.
Maybe he needs to be repotted.
Our company will continue to promote diversity.
I believe there is a real opportunity for growth here.
Good grief! Another vegetarian.
Hello, my name is Fern, I'll be moderating today.
We they said the new CEO was a bush, I expected Jeb.
You're probably wondering why I called this meeting.
C'mon people, it doesn't take a genus.
I want to announce that our company has gone green.
Suspicion grew that one of them was a plant.
Be careful what you say. Looks like a plant.

I think it's time we turned over a new leaf.
The Board has decided to "Go Green" and we've started with the CEO!
Are you guys feeding me horse manure?
His mother was a pistil. He's a son of a gun.
I think we may have taken this green initiative a step too far...
I thought it said 'focus group' too.
It has come to my attention that this board is in need of some pruning.
One more thing, let's keep the Watering Can gossip to a minimum.

I thought we agreed to stop watering it?
I'm just going to sit here until one of you gals brings me a cup of water,
As a vegan she always said "You are what you eat"
I've been saying this organisation needed a decision tree
With all due respect, I don't think light and water are gonna grow this company
Maybe he meant make America green again?
A show of hands for those in favor of a window box...
He used to be the CEO of House and Garden.
"THAT'S" the Supreme Court nominee?
So this is what he meant by going green.
How about we make like a tree and leave?
This seems like a pretty small step towards becoming carbon neutral.
The complaint has been duly noted: the seat at the head of the table should be assigned by seniority rather than who requires direct sunlight.
The new chair of the Climate Change Committee was rumored to have real roots in phytology.
Why did the drinking fountain step down?
First time running the meeting without the plant supervisor.
Uproot yourselves, and think outside of the pot.
The day marijuana became legal in New York .
I don't think this is what he meant by "invest in a rubber plant".
He's got the sunniest office in the building.
soooo... who again voted for the green candidate?
Maybe he's going a little overboard with this "blind trust" thing.
The society pages say he's a climber.
Keep talking. Apparently they like it.
Finally something that's alive around here.
They suspected a plant in the office.
I always thought the potted plant references were metaphorical.
I've heard of a power plant, but this is ridiculous.
I think he's really grown in this position.
As your new CEO, my first change is to eliminate the cafeteria salad bar.
Our competition has put a plant in this boardroom and no one leaves until we find out who it is.
He's all that's left of the Green Party.
The first meeting of The Ficus Focus Group.
It is time to turn over a new leaf.
Careful what you say -- it's a plant.
The board eventually discovered the competition's plant in their midst.
Mr. Green is not a dynamic speaker, but I find his presence very relaxing.
We will build a wall, a magnificient tall wall, and the deer will pay for it.
Allow me to clear up a few things before we get down to business. First, I've never met Moses and though, there is a resemblance, I am not that 'burning bush.'
He is serious about going green!
I like him better than the last guy.
I know the board said they picked a perennial as president, but I'm telling you, he's a fall guy.
Our competitors have planted a traitor on this board. Nobody leaves this room until we figure out which one is the plant.
I've gone to pot.
More water and less dogs, that's what we need.
I called this meeting to let you know we're going green.
Looks like the boss is turning over a new leaf.
The repotting will affect some more than others.
I'd like to thank all you who came today: Bud, Rose, Iris, Violet and all the rest.

I assure you the plant is not closing.

I am finally legal thanks to the committee.
These diversity quotas are getting a little out of hand
Does this mean no Christmas tree.
The dead wood is finally gone.
Time to prune?
Is it me, or is Fern looking under the weather?
I really want us to grow...
I'm deciduous by nature, so please feel free to remove your coats.
You are all about to discover that I am more than just a potted plant.
You said the company has plants in every department, but this is ridiculous!
Can I copy your notes after the meeting? I'm having trouble hearing what Fern is saying.
Your former Chair was about to suck all the oxygen from the room...
"Welcome to the biennial meeting".
I'm pleased to announce that we have secured our first round of seed funding.
Our profit margin isn't the only thing that's wilting.
I hear he gets about 200 times the fertilizer as the Philodendron downstairs.
These green initiatives are getting out of hand.
He's taken 'going vegan' to a whole new level.
At least he can't run for President, he's English Ivy
He's less prickly than the cactus, but still has serious intellectual limitations.
How much do you want to bet he uses the, 'if a tree falls in the forest' line again?
Be careful what you say, there's a plant in the room.
When they said they wanted to grow the company, I thought it was a metaphor.
As the board saw fit to compete head on with hedge funds...
As predicted the board chairman was a plant all along, but for whom?
Okay, then. Let's roll up our leaves and get to work.
I enjoy board meetings more since the Old Man started using pot.
Careful what you say about the merger - that's an FTC plant.
Now that the former director has been supplanted...
From what we've all heard, the competition has a lot of dirt on you.
And for all you conspiracy theorists, I am, indeed, a plant.
Just to be clear, I'm using the term "pruning" in a metaphorical sense.
We told him to be careful of that vegan diet.
Remember, he likes his coffee with extra grounds.
Well, we've tried every other growth strategy.
Maybe they've taken affirmative action too far.
The new GM could be here for awhile. He looks like a perenial.
It's our new biodiversity hiring policy
I heard the new chief was a plant from the competition, but I had no idea...
I don't care what you say. I don't like Bush either but he's still better than Trump.
All you people do is suck up my air.
Are you gonna finish that water, Krebbs?
I always thought the first one to break the greenhouse ceiling would be taller.
Sir, I understand that you can convert CO2 to O but I do not think that addresses our declining revenue.
You're wondering why I called YEW all here (heh, heh, heh)!
The meeting was adjourned when it was discovered that the president was in fact made of plastic
Did he say that we can be replaced or replanted?
Production isn't keeping up with sales...what's going on down at the plant?
This diversity initiative is really shaking things up around here.
Don't you think this is taking diversity too far?
No water for me. I tend to leak.
Yep, an invasive hostile takeover species.
This whole "going green" thing is getting out of hand.
There's no limit to how green this company can be.
It's an honor, Justice Thomas.
Stupid photosynthesis! He expects all of us to make our own food.
The boss is big on biodiversity in hiring.
He's always been a little potty, but I never thought he'd end up like that.
First off, anyone who's a vegetarian is fired.
Mr. President, how exactly do you plan to make America great again?
Forget sentience - the other candidate just wasn't trustworthy.
I'd like to clear the air.
As your new GMO from now on it is all about organic growth--anyone that disagrees can leave.
He said some new things were sprouting in his head.
Broke through the greenhouse ceiling, I hear.
Looks like our CEO is in a vegetative state.
Well, do we smoke it or do we eat it?
I nominate the fern in the hallway, next to the elevator, as co-chair.

You're right. It does make the room look bigger.
I move we revise our estimation of the previous CEO's intelligence.
I'm breathing better already

Diversity hire.
I expected someone taller

Gee Sid, I think I speak for us all when I say You look quite lush this morning!
I know we voted for change - but this is ridiculous.
Now let’s have a sunshine break on the rooftop.
Well, it's better than being called an empty suit!
Now that Mr.Trump is Mr.President we have Mr.Tree to replace him.
All those in favor of the motion, please exhale fully.
So, the question still remains. Should we legalize it?
Management wanted someone with better interpersonal skills.
Don't worry--he's legal in New York.
Looks like the seed of our idea has taken root.
I'm your new Chief Environmental Officer.
No one leaves this room till we figure out which of us is the Russian plant.
