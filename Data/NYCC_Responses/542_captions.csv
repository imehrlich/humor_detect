Oh, it keeps her from chewing on her leg.
Careful. She ruffles easily.

It’s a sensible precaution—she’s next in line to marry King Henry VIII.
That's going to be a long courtship.
Her problem is that she just gets too hot under the collar.
It's fashionable and guillotine resistant.
Things just haven't been the same since the Boleyn incident.

Another victim of white collar crime. Oh
Remember how big bell bottoms got?
The lady doth protect too much.
I understand that she's engaged to Count Michelin.
You wouldn't believe her chastity belt, either.
My eyes are up here, gentlemen.
In recent times, I have found it very difficult to get close to women.
A hickey, methinks.
I can assure you that she doesn't ruffle easily.
It's the latest in our chastity line.
The whole 'Age of Reason' idea is beginning to sound more and more like a good idea.

Most likely on her way to Trump Castle.
Well, at least it keeps her from texting.
She must have a devil of a time finding shoes to match!
I see that necklines are up this season.
You know, we've been dating for a year and I've never seen her unruffled.
I doth believe she descended from the Ottomans...
This latest fashion idea from Lady Goodyear seems to be getting some traction.
She asked me if I thought it made her neck look big. What was I supposed to say?

It's Guillotine-proof
Yes, Henry, she'd make a great queen, but she's afraid to stick her neck out.
Yes, I understand that she's married to the village veterinarian.
We went out once. Couldn't even get near first base.
Apparently it's all the rage in Transylvania

Truthfully, I think it DOES make her ass look big.
I can't believe it either -- exposed hands!
Don't talk to her. She's easily ruffled.
She tends to get hot under the collar
The lady doth protrude too much, methinks.
She's an orthodox shrew.
Wait until she tries to tie her shoes.
Careful! She ruffles easily.
I've heard it comes with a 40,000 mile warranty.
It'd be easier if we just let her vote.
Without doubt, the most severe case of collara I've yet seen.
I prefer unfiltered.
The lady doth protrude too much me thinks
Her shoes are hideous.

Muffler? Nope. Air Filter.
It's called a chastity collar.
It also doubles as an air filter.
I'm telling you, I think she's had work done.
I hear she's never been kissed.

She was caught necking.
She has a blind date with that Henry the 8th fellow.
She wants to stop smoking.
Way too much starch.
She's stacked!
Mary said she's going to party like it's 1599.

You should see the size of her chastity belt.
This didn't used to be such a ruff neighborhood.
You wouldn't believe what her dog is wearing
There passes the Duchess of Gouda.
Having her cake and eating it too, I think.
Sure, it's the height of fashion, but last week she tripped and rolled half way to Cornwall.
I heard that it is called a muffler.
Truth be told, her profile did say: "A diamond in the ruff." I assumed she was merely a poor speller!
Looks like her tutu went to her head.
'One way to tame a shrew"
It stops her from licking her stitches.
She gets them in bulk from Costco, but hasn't yet figured how to separate them.
Methinks the lady did protest too much.
Methinks the lady doth project too much.
Methinks the lady is playing hard to get at.

Never should have tried that new fabric softener
It must be allergy season again.
It's advertised to stop even a guillotine blade.

The Duchess of Goiter has an alluring modesty.
So you are calling it a muffler?
I think I'll call it 'ring around the collar."

She's Anti-beheading.
My god, her ears are showing! What's next, are women going to be able to breathe through their mouths?
She's engaged to Henry VIII.
Amazing! It's like her goiter disappeared.
It keeps Sir Trump away.
I like it ruff.
Her husband doesn't approve of unfiltered speech.
I told her not to get it wet.
That's how she rolls.
Yes, she's more than a little ruff around the edges.
Methinks it's some sort of insurance scam.
That's in case she runs into The Donald again.
It's a shame we have to make her wear it, but she just won't stop scratching.
I think she's over reacting to the Marie Antoinette thing.
It's to keep her from biting her nails.
Will Fashion Week never end?
I'm told that's Lady Mmrffghrghhhg.

Collar? I hardly even know her.
It's a rare case of cholera.
She may not have the brightest bulb, but oh what a lampshade.
chastity isn't the problem
I know it's awkward. But the doctor's worried she'd bite her stiches.
"She's engaged to Henry VIII".
Lady Hepa never gets sick.
That must be quite a hickey.
She should smile more.
It may seem very radical, but her diet plan IS working!
Lord Trump must be in town.
They say she wouldn't stop licking her sutures.
Not Anne Boleyn, but the one after her started wearing them.
I like big ruffs, and I cannot lie.

She hasn't been the same since Anne Boleyn.
Fashion week always pushes the limits.
I understand Henry VIII has his eye on her.
She bites her nails
The King invented it himself. It's called a muffler.
It's new. On the one hand, it's a fashion statement; on the other, she won't be making any more statements.
I would have opted for the 'A'.
That lass gets a round.
