"Should I check, “exceeded expectations?”"
Let’s just give him the damn cheese.
"Hmmmmm, we didn’t count on his thinking above the box."
'What's more impressive is he's already filed the patent.'
"Oddly, this one got the placebo."
"He doesn't just find the cheese, he offers same-day delivery."
He also submitted a resume for your job.
It appears that his 'fight or flight' response has evolved.
Maybe we should start with a smaller dose.
I hurt his feelings last week when I told him this wasn't rocket science.
We're going to need another grant
Rat maze navigation trial 14: Animal failed to follow simple instructions.
Do you suppose they’ve been toying with us all these years?
I'll bet HE could build a better mousetrap.
"He calls it a ""Rat Pack"""
She’s smart. Looks like we’ll need the glass ceiling.
"Yes, that's cool.  But it's not statistically significant."
"He flies and poops everywhere. Essentially, we've created a pigeon."
He also left us a tiny note with suggested revisions to our experimental design.
Now he's just showing off. He doesn't even like Swiss.
"No, I said I'd marry you when pigs fly."
I'm going with 'Above Average'.
It appears that someone has been using old copies of Popular Mechanics to line the cages.
Should we call the Pentagon or Disney?
Meanwhile the guy with the MAGA hat in the human-size maze is still bumping into the first wall.
...I think we should probably go check on the dolphins.
"Actually, the really smart ones just stay in their cages and use drones to get the cheese."
It's just a pilot study.
"The ""Failed to navigate the maze"" checkbox doesn't seem adequate."
He got his own funding.
Is this the batch we got from MIT?
...I’m more impressed that he thought to make a helmet
We call him Elon Mousk.
"What's really impressive, his degree is Art History."
"Unfortunately, the drug is supposed to treat erectile disfunction."
"Well, he's certainly thinking outside the box."
He had helicopter parents.
I'm not worried. The cats are developing ground to air missiles.
"Interesting, we didn't see these results with Kraft Singles."
"if he won't run the maze, how will we judge his intelligence?"
That explains his expense report.
Interesting. Most in the control group simply hailed an Uber.
"That, and he filed a flight plan."
This may skew our findings.
I've already got tenure. You write this up.
"Did he just say “fuck your cheese, I’m out”?"
"Ok, not bad, but let’s see if he can stick the landing."
That's amazing.  Let's dissect him.
Apparently you can win the rat race.
Even stranger is that he got the placebo.
"Once we switched to the smoked Gouda, they really started getting creative."
"If he gets the Nobel, he has to share it with us, right?"
How can we determine his intelligence if he keeps cheating on the test?
I think the engineering department is screwing with us again.
"Okay, we have to remove their Internet access."
"Well, there goes our bell curve."
I don't think 'Meets Expectations' quite covers it.
I think we'll call this one a 'statistical outlier.'
"Well, that's going to skew the results."
Always the short cut with this one.
By all accounts he excels at reaching the cheese but continually fails to pair the suitable wine.
I upped the dose a bit.
I'll have what he had.
"The jet pack's one thing, but does he have to sing, 'Here I come to save the day!' every time?"
"Call it cheating if you like, but I say he hit it out of the park."
This is going to make the Russian mouse furious.
Remember how I told you it would be obvious when it is time to retire?
I am pretty sure he just said “OK Boomer”.
"Think we can get away with just listing this under ""possible side effects?"""
"Don't know about you, but the genetically modified mice scare me."
"Well, technically he failed the test."
What was our hypothesis again?
"Forget the scientific journal, we’ve got to get this on Instagram."
The peer review is gonna be brutal.
Let’s rate this one as a high achiever with good altitude.”
I'm afraid he wants to be mentioned as co-author.
Tell those clods over in feline we're ready.
"Doesn't follow the rules. Possible signs of ADHD"""
He's a flight risk.
These little guys will be delivering packages for Amazon in no time!
"Think of all the paperwork. I say we kill him right now, replace him with another mouse and never say a word about this."
Put him down as a cheese wiz
I guess it IS rocket science
I knew something was up when he had us count down from ten.
This new generation of mice doesn't understand hard work.
Part drone. Part rat. It's a drat.
He's a rat and a cheat.
He heard they put Gruyere in the maze next door.
"Looks like, while the cat's away, the mice will study advanced engineering."
Exhibits inability to understand maze exercise
Don't feel discouraged if the mouse gets a PhD before you do
Yet he still poops on the floor.
He left a note saying he rejects our premise.
"Last week I took its drone away, and now this."
"Well, man had a good run."
I don’t think this is one of ours.  This looks like a Musk rat.
I think I know who made those charges on our credit card.
Close the window.
Don't let the pigs see this
How many genes did you say we altered?
"Just mark it down as, ""Did not reach the cheese."""
Motor skills appear above average.
It would seem that the CBD with Red Bull has far exceeded our expectations.
I think he got a bigger grant than we did.
Of course he scores a zero. He failed to navigate the maze.
He’s overthinking it.
It was the only way we could get funding from Amazon.
Red Bull is definitely more effective than coffee.
Let's see if he can pick stocks.
"Don't get me wrong, this is incredible, but I think we lost track of the whole curing cancer thing somewhere along the way."
Is it a bad time to mention that I forgot to label the mice?
I suspect this will skew our previous results.
I'm starting to think he doesn't even care about the cheese.
He must have been in that bunch of mice we got from MIT.
"This totally ruins our thesis, you know."
I’ll go and check on the pigs.
"This confirms our theory ....
He’s getting way more funding than we are”!"
He'll hit the roof when he finds out it's vegan cheese.
Now I'm curious to see what he'd do for a Klondike Bar.
He's no longer interested in the cheese. He's headed for the buffet.
"Yes, but that wasn't the assignment."
I told you not to leave the Science Channel on all night.”
We should never have accepted that grant from Amazon.
I just hope God isn't a mouse.
Some mice look at things the way they are and ask why.
I warned you about letting them watch Ratatouille
"It’s ok, he has a helmet."
He's learned how to cheat.  They're just like us now.
You do realize he is cheating?
"Elon, when do you want us to change you back?"
"Did it just say 'o.k., boomer'?"
He spent his first month at Tesla’s research lab.
Do you want to tell him the moon isn't made of cheese?
Lazy....but brilliant.
And Professor Fletcher can't find his way back to his office after he goes to the bathroom.
I shouldn’t have asked the engineers to take over for me when I was sick.
I guess we should cancel the wheel trial.
Well this definitely proves it……Mice are definitely smarter then The Kardashians.
This explains why the espresso machine in the break room was torn apart.
We've invented the pigeon
"That gives new meaning to the term, rat pack."
You should read his report on our observation techniques.
He's a Musk rat.
That's my DoD grant. Your NIH mice are behind me.
He's named it his Rat Pack.
"To be fair, the cat is away."
"I know he looks smart, but you should see what he posts on Twitter."
We should warn the snake lab.
You're the one who decided to use Popular Science as bedding
We should probably stop sampling the hallucinogens.
"Oh, to be able to do that at IKEA."
"Except for the implications for the future of human beings, it's great."
Perhaps we've been setting the bar too low.
...I was wondering what was in that tiny Prime box he had delivered to his cage!
Well obviously he's going to do better than the three blind one's.
Just a smidge of testosterone and he’s already learned to showboat.
If only all the side effects were this cool.
Are you sure you want to try it with apes next?
I think we underestimated the effect technology would have on Darwinism.
Amazing! but I think she's overqualified... and probably we can't sponsor her visa.
Our subways will never be the same!
I told you he was overqualified for the position.
"Wait, were we supposed to build a better mouse, or a better mousetrap?"
You're the one who used decided to use Popular Science as bedding
President Trump will be delighted to hear that his first Space Force trial is a success.
It doesn't count until he lands.
Remember when Mighty Mouse only needed a cape?
... let's report that we have observed a significant development of technical skills?
Good God we have a mouse that can think outside the box
Impressive but primitive in its reliance on fossil fuels.
That's also how they escape sinking ships.
I’m just going to mark it as inconclusive.
"Who knew, the cheese is the variable."
This is nothing. You should see what the monkeys are doing.
"From Amazon, where else?"
"Well, it IS the Year of the Rat!"
I guess good things do happen when you remove the glass ceiling!
There's probably no good time to tell you that Pinky here has been offered the directorship of the lab.
We caught him at the Tesla factory.
"Cut the crap, Iggy, did you or did you not give him an extra dose?"
Looks like it's time to build a better maze.
This isn't his first maze.
He could've bought tons of cheese with what he paid for that jetpack.
"All this time, I thought WE would win the genius grant."
He says he's from google maps...
I’m getting apprehensive about the primate trials.
"She’s now officially smarter than a politician"""
He's testing us.”
I think we’ve found our winner.
"Quick,  yes, but still not as quick as the mice who use Google Maps."
Sometimes I feel as though their lives are more interesting than mine.
Let's name this one MacGyver.
Are these the rats Tesla sent over?
I'm not sure this side effect qualifies as 'adverse.'
He heard the moon is made of cheese
I see why they call this the Year of the Rat.
The control group has a smaller carbon footprint.
He's just squeaking by. Let's see if he nails the landing.
"Your right, he didn’t solve the maze, but you have to applaud his ingenuity."
"Well, that explains what happened to the Buzz Lightyear doll that went missing from your desk."
See what happens when you don't teach to the test?
Who left the 3D printer on?
It’s amazing what they’ll do for gourmet cheese.
Let me guess. Not the placebo?
Is this animal testing us?
"Morning shift must have used extra sharp cheddar."""
Either they're getting smarter or we've done this too often.
It's the new iMouse from Apple.
I’m gonna mark that down as a ‘pass’.
Didn't see that coming
Imagine what he'd do for tenure.
Now let's see how long it takes him to pair it with the right wine.
Those mice from the NASA labs are such show-offs
This does not support our hypothesis.
"Technically, it didn't solve the maze."
"'A' for effort, 'F' for fuel efficiency."
I don't care what you say-I'm recording a failure to complete the maze properly.
I wondered what it was 3D printing.
I’m more interested in where he got the fuel than how he made the jet pack.
And I say give him the damned cheese.
We might want to lower the dosage at bit...
"We do have his signed consent form, right?"
It appears the Evel Knievel gene splicing experiment is a success.
"See, females are more creative!"
Smile. He hacked the lab's account and is live-streaming this flight.
"If you don't mind me asking...how did you get him to wear the goggles?"""
"Whoa, that one’s really thinking outside the box!"
"In his defense, we never read him the rules."
I hate working with these millennials.
We call that one Elon Mousk.
Big deal. He copied the idea from a New Yorker cartoon.
But is it statistically significant?
We knew this day was coming: The rat race has produced better rats.
Are you sure that was the placebo?
We've had nothing but problems ever since he read 'Who Moved My Cheese?'
"They left a note on my clipboard asking for dairy-free, soy-free cheese."
Just write “Advanced problem-solving skills.”
We're in trouble...Didn't you say that was the dumb one?
Does he have an exit strategy?
And I’m calling it “the rat pack.”
This one wrote ‘Epstein didn’t kill himself’ on the bottom of his cage.
And yet he still can't figure out this maze.
"You realize that if he succeeds, we're out of a job."
Let's wait to see the landing before we evaluate it's intelligence.
Is this a bad time to ask you out?
I think we are going to need to keep a lid on this.
"So anyway, Martha and I are getting a divorce..."
They just don't seem to delay gratification anymore.
Let's get him back in the cage before he develops a nuclear warhead.
"A one in a billion fluke maybe, but I also just found a very small volume of Shakespeare in one of the other cages."
I told you not to give him an Amazon gift card for Christmas.
It's a shame we have to kill him.
Are you sure this one is from the control group?
His name is Algernon. Why do you ask?
One small step for mousekind...
I think we just got skewed.
These millennial mice are ruining mazes.
"I knew they could do it, but how did they get the funding?"
Better than last week when he sent up a drone to find the exit
"Yeah, but he's just doing it for the Instagram likes."
It must be an Elon Muskrat.
Weren't we doing something with cancer?
He already has a patent and has applied to our grad program.
Great. They have jetpacks and we still DON'T?
Is it always this easy to identify outliers?
Now do you believe me?
Nature or nurture?
Maybe we can hire him.
That's thinking outside the box.
"What are we testing for, again?"
I guess you can stop saying they lack initiative.
"On the plus side, at least one of us will be getting tenure."
He's going to be so disappointed when he finds out what the moon is actually made of.
They must have sent us one of those Elon Muskrats.
He's still not getting tenure.
Let's check the dosage on that one.
M-I-T P-h-D M-O-U-S-E.
He works here to fund his own research on string cheese theory.
Maybe he can program the clock on the microwave?
"Well, that proves it. Brie will set you free."
We can bury this in the supplement.
"So we give the jet packs out in the subway, and then put a giant piece of cheese in New Jersey..."
I might have messed up the dosage.
NASA had him for awhile.
"Houston, I think we have a problem."
The scary thing is that a cockroach taught him how to do it.
Interesting. He picked the jet pack over the helicopter.
Swiss appears to be more motivating than Halloumi.
I guess our work is done here.
"For this study I thought, ""Give a rat some cheese and you feed him for a day, but give a rat a jetpack..."""
"You're impressed?  Well he hasn't got the cheese yet, has he?"
Please tell me this isn't the placebo.
"Your hypothesis ""mechanization does not improve outcomes"" is really being tested."
Her Father tested for NASA.
First day here in Los Alamos?
Remember when we used to give the rats cocaine?
He seems overqualified for the job.
"The last time we used brie, and he actually had a little flamethrower."
It's that damn  Amazon Prime again.
We could just reference this one in the footnotes.
This is why you shouldn’t get your mice from Cal Tech.
I'm calling him Elon Musk-Rat
Score this one high on ingenuity and low on perseverance.
I did think it was strange when he requested that tiny tool set.
"I asked him how he calibrates weight versus thrust, and all he did was squeak."
"Well, you're the one who taught her to read."
We probably shouldn't use the ones who went through STEM training.
I hope we’ve been nice to this one.
Five bucks says he can’t stick the landing
"""I sense our experimental parameters have subtly shifted."""
"Such a shame, he just can't seem to find the cheese without cheating."
Any idea where he got those goggles?
I feel less overqualified now.
"In conclusion, rats these days don’t know the value of hard-earned cheese"
A flying rat? Terry you just reinvented the pigeon.
Allowing roller skates was a slippery slope.
This is a game changer for cats too.
I think he's completed the pilot program.
I don’t think this is going to prove a damn thing.
The mouse that soared.
My robotic mouse can beat your genetically modified rat.
He insists it is less about the cheese and more about getting a mouse on the moon.
I'd say it's progress. Just last week they were using stilts.
Should we try pigs next?
We’ll have to kill that one so our results look good.
I hate this fucking job.
Looks like we have an overacheeser.
Are you sure this one got the placebo?
Year of the Rat is off to a great start.
Why weren't we warned he's a flight risk?
Should we let the cat out of the bag?
"So, can we move on to human trials?"
I knew it was a mistake to give them the Amazon password. .
Perhaps we should scale back the dosage just a little bit?
"Yes, he passes. I just wish he hadn't patented it."
This is remarkable. Just three weeks ago he had to take an Uber.
I guess he passes.
"He said  we’re irrelevant, is bored and is getting the hell out of here."
"Yes, we do see some variation in natural ability."
Do you think he'll let us share credit on this?
"Do we describe this as ""innovative"" or ""cheating?"""
"I think the little bastards are getting smarter, don't you?"
Did you ever feel like you're the one being experimented upon?
What hallucinogen are we testing today?
He wont do it unless we tell him what happened to Minnie.
I don't think we can launch the drug just yet.
I love you Sandra. I've always loved you.
"It wouldn't bother me so much, but he keeps calling it the ""Rat Pack."""
I think he's earned the wine pairing.
"Stupid rat, can’t even solve a simple maze."
I hope all they want is our cheese.
I still have to mark her maze run as incomplete.
Shall we move the cheese?
Maybe we should lock the tool box at night.
"It says here he's called ""Elon Mouske."""
I see Acme's miniaturized its coyote jet pack
These millennial rats are so lazy.
"Let's not tell anyone, okay?"
Fortunately this is one of the least common side effects.
I'll just put 'inconclusive'
"Ever since they heard the moon was made of cheese, our mouse-space program has really taken off."
"He can build a jet-pack with his genetically engineered brain, but his highest aspiration is still yellow cheese."""
I still say it’s cheating.
This is what happens when we don't give them explicit instructions.
I believe he’s the one who torched our hamster wheel last month.
It appears that our hypothesis was incorrect.
"Theoretically, that should not work."
Week 65: subject is displaying symptoms of a typical millennial and has decided to ruin the whole experiment
We had to give it to him as an accommodation but it's skewing the results.
I'm still struggling to see the market for this drug.
I knew we shouldn't have named his mother Necessity.
We call it Susan Collins' Syndrome. Afraid to make a decision.
"I don't care how amazing it is, we'll still need to dissect its brain afterwards."
I see your research is taking off
Is this the one Elon sent us?
Also an elevated sense of self-importance.
You gotta give it to him: thinking outside the box.
Die Fledermaus
wait till the subway rats get a hold of this
His mother flew on the Space Shuttle.
"It's incredible, but he's still last."
The mice are testing how long it will take you to learn your maze experiment isn’t working.
Do you have any idea how hard it is to make a hat that small for a rat?
"Well, it appears we've invented a pigeon."
That's what we get for breeding them with opposable thumbs.
At least he's wearing a helmet.
Look–he's using a tool.
It worries me that he's not interested in the cheese anymore.
The real question is: How did they perfect jet-packs before we did?
"You had him sign an updated liability waiver, right?"
"So, his exact words were, ""Here I come to save the day?"""
Definitely an outlier.
"I think your findings should take into account 
the fact that he never actually found the cheese."
"As your advisor, I must tell you that this experiment is fundamentally flawed."
"Yes, but are the results reproducible?"
Maybe he should be the one holding the clipboard?
Is that a pass or a fail?
"Ok Trudy, NOW will you go out with me?"
That's going above and beyond.
I want what he’s taking.
No more mice from the MIT gene lab.
Now let's try the one without an Amazon account.
"And just like that, Bubonic is airborne."
We're going to need more grant money
You DO realize we’ll NEVER be able to get this past peer review in any reputable journal?
This adds a whole new dimension to leaving the rat race.
You'd think he'd know how to land by now.
He has better funding.
"Oh Edgar is smart enough, but he’s a maverick not a team player at all.”"
I'm just surprised he managed to put on the goggles.
Nancy took the kids. I've started drinking again.
The NYC subway will never be the same again
"Genetic engineering, Candace. Not mechanical engineering."
He certainly upgraded from his pogo stick.
Can we just call this one an outlier?
Don’t tell the pigs.
Statistically? Not significant at all.
What happened to the three blind ones?
The grant from SpaceX paid up.
We're finding unexpected results with those on the 007 Diet.
"Oh brother! I think that's 'Here I Come to Save the Day' he's humming."""
So just YouTube? He wasn't allowed to visit any other site?
This one belongs to Elon Musk.
Did he sign a waiver?
"Which ehh, which box are you ticking for this?"
"Technically, he failed."
His funding is better than ours.
She says this whole cheese in the maze thing is beneath her.
AmazonMouse: because Alexa cannot bring you cheese.
Stop worrying. It'll never work outside of lab conditions.
"Why WOULDN'T a rat need this, Karen?"
"Well, that explains why he asked for a helmet."
Let's keep this to ourselves.
Looks like our research has finally started to take off.
History may not be kind to us for this one.
We’re going to need a better maze
The cat has a helicopter.
The 'placebo effect' is remarkable.
".... that's all well and good, but I think he missed the point of the task."
It's really just a classic fight or flight response.
We both knew this day would come.
He’s pretty jazzed about that rat pack.
Explains why he never took to the wheel.
Is it weird that I wish I was him?
I never thought I'd lose my job to automation.
I really thought we'd have jet packs before them.
What do you say we just give him the cheese?
Maybe it was a mistake giving him a credit card.
I think we’re gonna need a better maze.
He really thinks outside the box!
IQ off the charts.  Sucks as a pilot.
It's innovation out of frustration. We did keep moving his cheese...
Pretty good. But the chipmunk works for peanuts.
He has taken the pilot project seriously!
It counts higher if he makes a fondue.
You realize the real bioethical issue is who owns the patent.
Imagine what he would have done for Havarti?
"He told me it will be ""one giant leap for mousekind."""
"After all, you did get him from the aerospace lab!"
"I guess it depends what you mean by ""progress."""
And this experiment was funded by Elon Musk.
She became extraordinarily motivated after we switched to gruyere...
I had no idea he had an Amazon account.
"You think that’s cool, you should check out the cat and the litter box next door."
Do you think he’d take a selfie with me?
"If you want to build a better mousetrap, you need a better mouse."
This will really skew the results.
This is what happens when you take away little Stuart's plane.
"Yeah, but we're testing how fast they can get t͟h͟r͟o͟u͟g͟h͟ the maze."
So I said of course we’ll get different results with mice from France. But did they listen?
Where’d he get the goggles?
Should we report this as a potential side effect?
I'm not sure the CBD infused Swiss was such a great idea.
I think we can check improves mental acuity.
He also wants crackers and fig jam...not an unreasonable request.
Maybe we should do the human testing first.
He feels cheese is beneath him.
That’s why we named him Elon Muskrat.
They never cease to amaze and then they actually cease to a maze.
That's a pass...right?
That's definitely a 'far exceeds expectations'.
"His  union rep called.  The contract calls for Gruyere, not Swiss."
I had a feeling upgrading to the aged Asiago would skew the results
One small flight for a mouse; one giant flight for mousekind!
Forget about the maze.  He flew over and ate my lunch.
He keeps complaining that we moved his cheese.
"Well, now we know what happens when we make him listen to Elton John non-stop."
"In mouse years, I'm afraid he's a Millennial."
But can he land it.
That's what happens when you line the cage with DIY magazines..
This one definitely shows signs of learning.
"""He thinks he's outsmarting us, but we're actually testing the effect of cheese on his cholesterol."
Let's try giving him a typewriter next.
It is really good cheese.
"Another failed intelligence test...the cheese is right there, dumb dumb!"
NASA thinks that if we tell him that the moon is made of cheese that he'll help with the rocket.
Did he get the drug or the placebo?
He's applying for Trumps space force when he finishes here.
They've been watching a lot of  YouTube videos.
I was worried about those small Amazon deliveries.
He built a better mousepack.
Is this the mouse we got from the Cal Tech lab ?
The real question is where did he find those tiny goggles?
I think I've figured out who's been ordering the Cheese Lover's Pizzas online in the middle of the night.
Tell the President they're ready...
his dad was a Harvard lab rat
I think this one is from the NASA lab upstairs.
"Yeah, it really was a rocket science."
How does she operate the jet pack without thumbs ?
I'd say we have a new alpha.
What did you feed him last night?
Can we agree that the experiment is inconclusive?
We've got his family. He won't go rogue.
I'll lock the door.
"‘Mondays, am I right?"
"We got him from NASA, and nobody checked what else came in the box!"
He's not just thinking outside the box. He's headed for the window.
"Well, if you give a mouse a jet-pack..."
"So, pass or fail on the maze test?"
You’re right. Five doses is too much.
We're still using the 2019 maze for the 2020 rat.
At least he's not vaping anymore.
I think he was expecting Gruyere.
The subject seems to have..ascended.
I didn't anticipate he'd skip right over Pavlov and go straight to drone technology.
"The weirdest thing is he still ran the maze, he's just toasting a brioche."
We're definitely going to have to reexamine our assumptions.
His name is Rat...James Rat.
Do we need to add this to the list of side effects?
No more joint experiments with the engineering department.
I never thought about a roof did you?
This is what we get for letting them unionize.
"What's really impressive is his use of eco-friendly, cheese-based rocket fuel."
We should never have let him watch those Macgyver reruns.”
My theory is that our readers will be tracing the maze with their fingers and they'll fail to come up with a caption about a flying rat.
High achiever?
And this is why we have cats with hang-gliders.
The problem is the exhaust always melts the cheese.
He learned how to build it on YouTube.
They gave the grant directly to the rats.
If he wasn’t just hovering in the same spot for 20 minutes I might have been impressed.
"You know we’re going to have to falsify the data, right?"
He is taking a “Rat Pack “ to a higher level..
"If you didn’t just sing “Here I come to save the day!”, who did??"
You can blame Marvel Comics for this
While she scored highly for completion - we have to mark her down for failure to follow instructions
What's the protocol for this?
The last one used Amazon Prime.
His nickname is Cheese Whiz
I told you it was vulnerable to an airstrike.”
We might have to revisit that hypothesis
Why do we even bother to test these mice raised at NASA?
We might have underestimated our intelligence.
So... Points for style?
"When you switched to the Limburger, all hell broke loose."
I'm even more impressed that he ordered it from Amazon.
I'll give him an A for effort.
I didn't realize little helmets like that were even available.
I'm sorry I doubted your jet-pack theory.
I still think giving him all of Jeff's adderall was a bad move.
Just give him the cheese and move on.
Think of how much exercise the cats will get!
"Ooops, one of Elon's."
It's an impressive result... but is it statistically significant?
"Wait, this one is from the control group?!"
"It's not that impressive, we gave him the parts to make a teleporter."
Is this mouse number 007?
Didn't I say not to use the good cheese?
Maybe we should have tried a half dose
"I told you the maze needs a roof. And you said ""No it doesn't. It's not like mice can fly,"""
Now if we could only get him over his fear of flying.
"We gave him a cookie, he asked for milk, yadda yadda, he's got a jet pack now."
Now he's just showing off.
Forget science journals. We should go for a TED Talk.
"For all intents and purposes, he is now a pigeon."
It seems the time has come to lay out some ground rules.
This is the same one that built the remote control in the Skinner box.
I guess you could say he built a better jet pack.
"Impressive, yes. But can he stick the landing"
I would say the hand cream has no harmful side effects
He’ll get it when he runs out of fuel.
"I'm going to mark this down as a ""Partial Success""."
"Yes, but have we cured its erectile dysfunction?"
She wants Tuesday night off for a MENSA meeting.
He's innovating. Call Security.
I’ll put him down as an outlier.
The one with the jetpack clearly seems faster.
"Now, we just have to change their image, and they'll be delivering packages all over New York."
"Seems a bit complicated for a yes/no decision, doesn't it?"
"My question is, where did she get that tiny helmet?"
The really smart mice produced their own cheese instead of building jetpacks
I can’t decide if I’m in awe or terrified.
Sigh... Another failure to navigate the maze.
But where's the progress if he can't land?
He’s not so smart. The door to the lab is locked.
"It works great, I’m just concerned about his carbon pawprint."
Is that the lactose intolerant one?
But how's his erectile dysfunction?
I was wondering who put in the requisition for jet fuel.
"No, we intend to learn what motivates the government to fund these experiments"
Mighty Mouse 2.0 is amazing.
"so, we didn’t anticipate that..."
"There goes our best-laid plan, Dr. Steinbeck."
Enough tests. I’m taking some right now.
Six years at Stamford. Top my class. Think this mouse gives a shit?
Did we modify the gene for genius or for cheating?
This is the one who thinks he's a bat.
An outside the box solution.
I think I know who rigged that little treadmill to power the entire building.
It’s the only way we can keep our funding from the Pentagon.
Well...his times ARE faster...
Make sure that one doesn’t get out of the lab!
Hmmm   Subject noncompliant.
It seems the subject got a hold of my Red Bull
He's been impossible ever since we told him that this is the Year of the Rat.
He finds the iPhone in 12 seconds.  But with the cheese he won't even try.
It IS the year of the rat!
That’s the fourth one this week. Maybe we should switch to brie.
That’s one way to beat the rat race.
I'll show you the chimps after lunch.
"That’s cheating, right?"
Dumb rat -- can't read the rules.
"Well, so much for evolution."
Do you think the maze is obsolete?
Results are conclusive: the walls aren't a deterrent.
"Well, that was unexpected."
Guess who just won the Nobel Prize for Physics?
He wanted to rise above the rat race.
"Well, let's just see how he lands it."
He used to work at NASA.
Family money.
"Well, it is 2020."
"That must be #3, Elon Mouse."
Wow. Just wait 'til our peers review this.
Perhaps we should rethink the variables.
I don't have a column on my report for this one
This is what happens when you don't own your data.
Imagine what he’d do for an opioid.
That's Elon Mousek!
Her CV does mention that she used to test for NASA.
It looks like we have a new lab assistant.
so much for that $21.6 billion wall
"Will he use sight, smell, or GPS?"
"Technically, it’s illegal, but there’s no precedent"
"I'm recording this as ""failed to complete the maze""."
I think we have a mole in our lab.
Apparently Petsmart sells them.
We need to stop letting Acme Industries fund our research.
It's his resignation letter.  He's going to be a stunt double for Disney.
Did I tell you he got a package from Amazon?
"Well, we didn’t specify HOW she gets to the cheese."
I don't like that we have to share this lab with the engineering department.
He's giving it his all. Can't we do better than a three month-aged cheddar?
Safe to say he didn't get the placebo.
1980 called. They want their rat maze back.
I was certain it would pick the flying car.
Do you think we can get a publication out of this?
"Before we can draw our conclusions, we need to get a list of all the movies that were shown at the cinema multiplex where we trapped him."
This is the annoying one
Building a better mousetrap is the least of my worries.
It's not because he's white.
"If you think that’s something, wait until we uncork the Bordeaux."
We did tell him to think outside the box.
Would you rate it as 'success' or 'failure'?
I'd bet his parents paid a consultant 50K to cheat the test.
I suppose it's just possible that he's on the way to save the day.
I hate it when the mice are smarter than we are.
"It sounds like he’s singing, Here I come to save the day."
Build a better maze.
I told him it was artisanal.
This one's from the E.B. White batch.
He’ll keep quiet if we make him co-author of the published study.
But can he dance?
Looks like he is one Tedtalk away from world domination.
There go our best-laid plans.
...and the only new variable is that he started reading sheets from The New Yorker on the bottom of his cage?
We didn't foresee this when we borrowed him from the NASA lab.
She probably saw it on YouTube.
"If he hovers and toasts it, I’m quitting."
I'm so sick of proving rats are smarter then I am.
"Impressive results, the control group haven't advanced beyond hoverboards."
He won't touch it now that he's a vegan.
Let's see how he does with the flying cat.
"I feel oddly shaken, but not stirred."
Let's put this one in the tobacco study.
"I mean, I'd be more impressed if it was hydroelectric."
"If he’s that smart, you’d think he’d just make his own cheese."
And here we have Lab Mouse number 007.
"You used the engineering manual to bed the cage, didn't you?"
"Poor little thing, do you think he knows he's a guinea pig?"
"Don't worry: ""Mice Can Cheat"" is a fine conclusion."""
"Must be the Tang."""
"First,  close the windows.  Then call the Pentagon!"
Last time I borrow a lab rat from NASA.
What say? Time to buy shares of that brain boosting supplement maker?
What did you put in the cheese?
"We might not get this in Nature, but what about Popular Mechanics?"
No more rats from the AI lab.
You'd really think he'd just leave.
"Sure it's impressive, but why's he still here?"
He said he’s tired of the rat race.
Who says rats aren't exactly rocket scientists?
So he cheats! Doesn't that mean he's even smarter?
I'm starting to feel like they're winning.
I smell a rat.
So are we hypothesizing the intelligence of mice or the quality of the cheese?
This is nothing. Yesterday he was spotted in Wisconsin.
She said she needed space
"Now, let’s see if he can stick the landing."
This skews everything.
We may have to separate him from the others.
"Man, my cat is going to be pissed when he hears that I started this."
He's taking all the fun out this.
You must write very good grant proposals.
Iran won't know what hit them.
Is he allowed to do that?
I have my doubts about peer review.
"Whoa, disruptive!"
We're hesitant to acknowledge his accomplishments lest he start looking for better opportunities elsewhere.
Looks like your genetic engineering experiment really took off!
"What do you think, NSF or FAA?"
"Impressive, yes, but still hasn't mastered landings"
Algernon is getting good at this.
okay zoomer
That's one giant leap for micekind!
I think he’s beyond cheese.
"I think our species is in trouble"""
End the research; jetpacks are not in our grant funding.
We'll need to observe his social visits from friends and family members more closely.
"Well, you know what they say about the best-laid schemes of mice and men..."
I suggest we falsify the data.
Better than last week with the pole vaulting.
I follow him on Instagram
You can always tell the mice from NASA
This is what happens when you bring out the good cheese
Does your clipboard have a box for that?
"It's not really in the spirit of the game, is it?"
Why does he get a jet pack and I have to take the subway to work?
let's walk back the hormone experiments
I wonder what will happen when we get to the pigs.
"So this counts as completing the maze, right?"
He works for Amazon.
It appears to be a 21st Century mouse vs. a 20th Century maze
We never should have given him an Amazon account.
Mark this one down as an outlier.
He has a masters from MIT.
I would dial the dose back a touch. For our sake.
"Well he’s out, you know the rules..... no helmets."
"Yeah, but it’s still cheating."
I think it's safe to say he's our alpha.
Mark it invalid - he's outside trial parameters.
Next time let's just use the mice from MIT to feed the snakes.
Good thing the animal rights people have been too busy with climate change.
"Sure he set a new record for running the maze, but he didn't follow the rules so we'll have to consider the drug a failure."
I thought Red Bull was supposed to give them wings
I didn't even see her put it on.
"Well, he IS the fastest, but we really can’t record that because he is obviously cheating."
Best time yet
We could just hand it to him.
But can he teach his methodology to others?
"What do you know, that Smartwater really works after all."
"The experiment was a success, the humans suspect nothing"
I worry that switching to the Emmenthaler may have skewed the results.
"Well, it looks like Amazon has scaled back on their drone delivery expectations “."
I bet you didn’t see that coming.
I knew we shouldn't of accepted these free mice from NASA.
So that's what happens if you give it a cookie
That’s nothing—he built a portal gun to get to the smoked Gouda.
I wonder what else he got for Christmas.
Let's just say this data point should be excluded and move on.
Maybe the gene therapy was a little too effective.
I'd say that intelligence gene modification was a success!
Are we counting the six weeks it took him to build that?
They’ll never convince me that genetically modified mice don’t skew results.
"we're gonna need more cheese"""
The strangest part is he's only the control group
Maybe we’re not using the right cheese.
If you give a mouse a jetpack...
I like to remember simpler times.
My bad....I taught Alexa to speak mouse.
"He thinks this is a ""Micky Mouse"" operation."
They seem to be evolving more quickly than anticipated.
"0932 fails the maze, but his coolness is off the charts."
"We'll it's no flying pig, but I still didn't think I'd ever see this."
I told you cheese gives you gas!
"With the time it took to get that thing on and fire up the jet pack, he’s actually slower than the other rats."
So this is how the plague became airborne...
42; but I have no idea what that means.
I haven't seen him since he escaped from the maze and stole our mind enhancing drugs.
This is the one doing intermittent fasting?
You forgot his water bottle.
I got tired of watching them just walk through the maze.
Five points off for environmental impact.
"If they still don't believe in evolution after this, we should give up."
His name is Bond. Rat Bond.
Millennial.
You picked a lazy one. Put him back and grab a mouse that will run.
Did I win?
Does he know the prize is just a piece of cheese?
Very impressive but 407-b made a nice fondue so he gets my vote.
"Trouble is, once he touches down, it’s the same old rat race again."
It's time to retire this one.  He's catching on to us.
I told you-engineers don't understand behavioral research!
You need to control more variables!
"Amid severe budget cuts, auditions for the next James Bond movie continued."
"Okay, but I'm not impressed with his lateral thrust control."
You say he did this after how many attempts?
Equally impressive is the fact that he built that from the water bottle.
Is he one of the lab rats we got form MIT?
Exactly how does this help funding for Spaceforce?
Who are the rocket scientists now?!
"Brings a whole new meaning to ""Rat Pack,"" doesn't it?"
So amphetamines do give them a lift
The good news for us is that a mouse can't be named on a patent.
"The funny thing is, he doesn't even like cheese"
She still has to stick the landing.
"With all due respect to Sammy, Dean and Frank... let’s just call it The Rat Pack."
So your biggest concern is that each mouse gets a jetpack rather than where this one came from?
He's just acting cocky now.
"If we move fast, we can probably get a Netflix deal out of this."
I can hardly wait to section his brain!
He will get the cheese before we get the grant
He’s been working on his landing.
"Ever since we introduced the VR app, none of the rats want to do the real maze."
This one's thinking outside the maze.
Im thinking we should anesthetize the smart-ass. You?
What if he just grabs the cheese and goes?
Let's just clock it at five seconds and call it a day.
Maybe the test didn't really challenge the subject.
Now that's one giant leap for ratkind.
We’re going to need a better mousetrap.
We are going to need a three dimensional maze.
So much for the plan to develop a better mousetrap
I’m recording this result as an outlier.
I really don't think he's coming back.
well at least he’s wearing a helmet
I’m concerned that he’s one of the three blind ones.
They left a note that said they'd rather look for pizza in the subway.
"Instinct, my ass!"
"First the movie Cats, now this."
"Sure, the engineering is impressive, but it just goes to show he lacks a sense of direction."
Now that's what I call thinking outside the box!
"For me, this just underscores how amazing you look in that lab coat Cynthia."
I knew we shouldn't have watched Mission Impossible in the lab!
"Oh, Mr. Musk is going to heart emoji this!"
It hardly seems fair to the others.
I promise I told Amazon not to send Stuart Little
These millennial rats get so bored with lever-pressing.
I'm visualizing a Nobel Prize here but we may need to tweek the hypothesis.
The Mouse that Soared. Amazing!
Looks like we finally have a cheese wiz we can be proud to serve.
"Yes, he’s very clever, to but I still say it’s cheating."
Do are we to conclude that the mouse will  always choose the jet pack over the intellectual challenge of the maze?
Still didn’t find the cheese in the maze.
How are we going to spin it this time...
"If we need it, your cat's in your office, right?"
Maybe we'll get tenure if we pretend we invented it.
"I don't think he got the point of the experiment."""
That's.... amazing?
"We've moved beyond the classic maze to one of full immersion virtual reality. Unfortunately, it still wants the real cheese."
"But Susan, would you say this is slightly more intelligent or greatly more intelligent?"
One giant step for mousekind.
"Brenda, I know you said when pigs fly, but..."
This is game changer.
We need to update our paradigm.
"Damn, even I didn't think of that."
"Welp, the plague is airborne now"
"Yeah well, he’s built these devices before. They look terrific but they never really work."
"So, where do you want to go for lunch?"
"Well yes, the learning curve is somewhat quicker than expected."
"He thinks he can outsmart us, but the cheese is just a hologram."
He’s not allowed to use that.
Its a new Apple  mouse.  You tell them they got  the product request wrong?
Today's mice are not the same as the one's before the internet.
Guess we'll have to do a better job of hiding the cheese.
"Well, seems like a good time to break for lunch."
She's always been a prodigy.
I told you we shouldn't have let him watch that James Bond movie.
We gotta stop using mice from the engineering department.
Do you reckon it'll be easier to get clearance from the FAA than from the FDA?
The one time your boss observes you...
It says her that one of the common side effects is 'Mighty Mouse Syndrome'.
He deserves more than cheese.
His helicopter is in the shop again.
We’re going to have to allocate more of our budget to the cheese.
WOW! ...He applied what he learned!
We'll have to disqualify him for failure to follow rules.
Her resume did specifically mention breaking through the glass ceiling.
He's ahead in the ratrace.
"Well, at least he didn’t use a GPS."
I think their technology is more advanced than we thought.
He doesn't do cheddar.
I think we'd better stop lining their cages with grant-proposal forms.
"And from now on, he'd like to be called 'Edam Musk'."
I spent two weeks building this maze!
I quit.
What is this Kobayashi Maru he keeps talking about?
"Cross out ED and put in ""improves intelligence"""
You're right; it's time to put a lid on it.
"You give a mouse a cookie, he'll ask for a jet pack, I guess."""
"Come on, jet packs always skew the test results."
Let's see them try to ban animal testing now.
We'll be needing a lot more cheese from here on out.
He's a jetpackrat.
"Say he doesn’t use it to get to the cheese, but uses it to take the cheese.  Then what?"
"Well, that’s one small flight for mouse..."
"The drug was originally developed as a cure for male pattern baldness, but marketing are quite excited about the possibilities."
"I swear, I was only gone for 10 minutes."
"She designed this maze, which looks remarkably like our lab complex."
Perhaps we shouldn't borrow mice from the Drone Lab anymore.
"I hate to say it’s stupid, but really... this is the 23rd time and it still cannot run the maze."
I knew it was a mistake to lend him out to the Jet Propulsion Lab !
He’s thinking outside of the box!
He's been trained to think outside the box.
It started after we put the cheese on the top shelf.
I think we’ve created a Muenster!
"I know that gadget must have been expensive, but then he is a ""prime"" member so shipping was free."
"Impressive, yes.  But he's completely ruining my dataset."
If it can't work out the maze route then we count it as another fail.
My guess is that he’s a Musk-rat.
I think we stop using Marvel movie loops as our stimuli.
"Cheese, the great motivator."
"Sure, he’s off the charts on the technical side, but it’s at the expense of his artistic merit score if you ask me."
So imported cheese does make a difference?
"Wait, I’m not giving him a Pass until he actually eats the cheese..."
"Oh, that’s just Chuck E. Yeager."
Amazingly advanced?  Yes.  But also cheating.
When he said he's over this whole maze thing.  I didn't understand what he meant.
Why didn’t we put a top on it?
"Well, he did pay for the lab"
Great. Now he'll want a share of our funding.
"I want to publish too, but will it pass peer review?”"
That seals it.  I'm doubling my daily dose of B12.
There's no natural law against it.
I read 70% of published results weren’t reproducible.
You said its name was Elon Muskrat?
I asked for a vertical mouse for my computer.
Just as I suspected.
I don't know. Maybe we should raise the height of the walls?
"And that's zero points for delayed gratification!"""
Did I ever tell you that Stuart Little was my first crush? I want to be scared but this is super sexually confusing for me.
"So Carol, what's for lunch?"
Just give it a second. He still won’t find the cheese.
Where do you suppose he got the rocket fuel ?
Is that for the Amazon contract?
You should see what the one with water-skis can do
Can you double-check that this is the control group?
He wins.
This is definitely an outlier.
A little gene-splicing – and he's already way ahead of you.
It seems she is aware of our status change from College to University.
Shows initiative. Failed to find the cheese.
They don't learn the maze and they don't want to exercise. These rats are just like my kids with their tech toys.
I’m going to check “Thinks outside the box” on that one.
Red Bull is now underwriting the study.
Gee whiz - Why didn't we think of that?
Apparently our maze is old school.
I thought you gave him the jet pack.
They were bred for the space program.
"So that's what happens when you give a mouse an Amazon Prime account!"""
I wondered how the cow jumped over the moon.
Let’s call that an outlier.
We may be witnessing the origin story of the next Marvel comics superhero.
I told you we shouldn't have shown them Mission Impossible
"Don't be offended, but I've always been attracted to black women"
We have been encouraging  them to think outside the box.
"He's rejected the cheese, but seems to be eyeing the liquor cabinet."
Now this is truly a mazing.
Let’s switch back to the Roquefort.
"Subject #007 lives up to his name, I see."
This experiment seems cheesy.
They never bothered to use the jet pack for the Stilton.
"While I admire the innovation, I don't see how this will help.  He's still a blind mouse."
"Don't worry, we can market this to Amazon and make a bundle!"
"Well, B.F. Skinner is not here, is he?"
"Meh, not so impressive. The previous specimen had Amazon Fresh deliver it right to him."
I spent a week building this maze.
"Well, Tonya, what did we learn?"
Oh it definitely didn't do that for the Muenster...
"Of course, he's outgrown his maze; I told you the reward was too generous."
I think we're going to need higher walls.
"Shouldn't we be concerned, Henry?""
""No, Janice, he is wearing a helmet."
We need to develop a retirement plan.
"Is it just me, or do you get the impression we're underestimating their cognitive skills?"
Should we tell him this won't get him the participation compensation?
"Personally, I would have walked."
"I think we did it, Meghan. We have indisputable evidence. They’ll have to take Trump University serious now!"
Are they allowed to do that?
It's not his first rodeo.
"He said with just a little more funding, he can get it out of the prototype stage."
"Don't tell the boss about this. If she finds out how smart this rat is, there go our jobs."
I just checked.  There is nothing in the rules agains it.
They were promised cheese; what did you expect?
We really need to stop buying rats from Richard Branson
Evolution just took a flying leap.
He's training to be the mascot for the Space Force
I guess we should make the next maze a little harder.
Just wait until he tries to go over water.
I hate smart ass mice!
"First I take your cheese, then I take your research grant!"
He will attempt to cure cancer next.
OK. Send in a request for a maze lid.
"That’s one small step for a mouse, one giant leap for mousekind."
The pepperjack seems to have the biggest kick.
Using jet fuel? In this economy?
I can’t say whether this experiment was a failure or a success.
This gives new meaning to Rat Pack.
I denied their request for gouda.
Guess that settles its fight for flight response.
We're gonna need a better maze
I told you not to use the NASA mice.
They're not THAT smart. They still can't figure out the afterburner. Don't look at the ceiling if you have a weak stomach.
Do you think it can find a way to get us out of here?
Our next grant application is to NASA
You wanted the other kind of pack rat?
"After all the training and student loans, it's come to this."
Isn't he lactose intolerant?
Is that a Tesla logo?
There’s one  way to beat the rat race.
The cheese is to fly for
I blame the Millennials.
I told you using the Gouda would make a difference
"Same dose as the other rats, except this ones got style."
Did you download the GPS app into the helmet?
We have to stop letting the undergrads design our experiments.
He says one more cheese maze and he'll vaporize us.
They did demand a double blind study!
Another project funded by the Pentagon?
What kind of cheese are we using?
"Now that he easily solved it, he thinks he's the big cheese."
Where’d she get the helmet?
I can't wait to see what happens when we double the dose of this new drug.
Well I think she’s disqualified.
No! Don’t tell the boss...the little guy has earned it.
Do you think we have gone a bit too far with our behavioral testing?
Now he wants his own Youtube channel
There's our proof.  IQ testing is necessary.  All mice are not created equal.
So that's what he meant by having a 'power lunch'.
I didn't know that he was one of the three blind ones.
"Yes it is cheating, but look at him fly!"
‘Its only a small step sir’
Can't we please just give him the cheese?
I think we should still count this as failing the maze
That Pet CBD oil is amazing...
Do you think he'll like that cheese?
And he's selling our cheese
"The control group is using hang gliders."""
Maybe we shouldn't have used the mice from Mensa!
Mice these days are so lazy.
He's certainly got better funding that we do.
Not to mention we'll need a better trap.
Letting him watch every episode of Pinky and the Brain seems to have paid off
He's part of the control group that includes pepperoni.
Algernon always was an overachiever.
Let’s roll him back to triple espressos in the morning.
This is always the easy part. He now has 15 seconds complete the raclette stage.
This rodent is pure Evel!
Lining their nests with that Asimov novel is skewing our data
"You ever think how, in a way, we're all just working to get that cheddar?"
You shouldn't have named him Elon Mousk.
This one is in our 'Not Exposed to Social Media' subgroup.
Sometimes you're the cheese and sometimes you're the rat.
Do you remember when flubber was the state of the art?
"Note that when it comes to cheese, Buzz is highly motivated."
"Don’t get excited, the engine appears to be powered fossil fuels."
This one must be getting help from the outside
I knew those JPL lab rats were gonna be a problem.
They go to extremes for Gruyere.
"Well, so much for pavlovian conditioning. I think she made the labyrinth irrelevant."
They’re getting tired of the daily rind.
I guess there is such a thing as too much funding.
Do you think they will still say the findings aren't generalizable?
Let’s put him in a cancer study.
Holy shit. Dad is gonna kill us.
What? You told me to think outside of the box!
Technology makes this generation so lazy!
I raised the dosage of Adderall for this one
"I suspect, they were only doing it because it meant so much to us."
I told you we shouldn't let him get deliveries from Amazon.
Want to go back to my place?
"Well, sure, if he's going to cheat."
"I figured a dose of cocaine that size would have killed him. But instead he became, like, insanely tight."
"Apparently, he was too stupid to figure it out."
"My mistake, I thought management said to research autono-MOUSE drones."
He's cheated before.
Still think STEM is right for you?
"After his bankruptcies, fraudulent charity,  fraudulent university, and a dozen sexual assault accusations, this looks acceptable."
Interesting.
That one's Elon Muskrat.
We're going to need a harder maze.
"If you give a mouse a jet pack, he will shatter your research."
Are you sure you put the L.S.D. in HIS water?
I think we should just give him our job and call it a day.
"Despite all his rage, he is still just a rat in a maze."""
Algernon seems to be making great strides!
I told you we should've set some ground rules.
I really hate the scientific method.
He's on loan from the jet propulsion lab.
There's always one smart-ass in the cage
Does that mean it's technically a bat?
Any idea how we score this one?
"Don’t forget, we’re calculating rat intelligence
with a truncated mean, discarding the high and
low ends. So just ignore this little guy."
Who studies behaviour any more anyway?
"Given that she designed and built her own jet pack, her ability to learn and navigate the maze seems like a profound misallocation of resources."
Our critics are going to have a tough time reproducing the research data on this one.
Let's clone this one.
"Um, these results are going to be difficult to reproduce."
He’s a transfer from the MIT lab.
I'll bet B.F. Skinner never imagined this.
I guess he was thinking outside the box.
Did you use the good cheese again?
We need to invent a better maze for this one.
It’s Elon Mousk
Clearly he's the over-achiever
That has to be my late husband—his kind of trick for sure.
The Helmut was his idea.
Apparently they're smarter than we thought they were.
R&D is doing well I see?
"Well, I guess this proves your theory that when we take away their sense of smell the rat can adapt."""
What kind of cheese did you put in there?
They go a little crazy for the Boursin
"Evolution, time to build a better mouse trap or find a new job."
"Greatest leap in mouse tech, and he still just wants the cheese."
There's got to be an easier way to grill cheese.
Smart?  Smart!  He hasn't even patented it yet!
It's only a matter of time before he figures out drone delivery.
Do you think the mouse would mind if I ate the cheese?  I skipped lunch today...
I didn't give it to him. I thought you gave it to him.
Association doesn't mean causation.
I think Karen has spent too much time watching the Jetsons during her breaks
It's the prototype for a micro-delivery service to cat-free households.
"Well, looks like our hypothesis about income inequality in this population is confirmed."
This won't cure cancer.
You let him watch Star Wars didn't you?
I'm afraid the experimental design makes no allowance for this level of adaptive  behavior.
"Is this that ""Rat Pack"" people are always talking about?"
I feel like one of the Three Blind Mice.
These NASA Rats cut straight to the cheese.
Year of the rat? 2020 is year of the gear of the rat.
"He’s smart, but a total cheater."
Pretty soon he’s going to want more than cheese.
His air-to-fuel mixture is way off. Rookie move!
Tweet the President: Space Corps passed first test.
This may be how the keep getting in.
This must be the one in Mensa.
"Well, he did after all solve the problem"
"That's one giant leap for Mickey, but sadly, the end of our maze experiments."
"Clever yes, but the rat didn't learn the maze."
"In 2020, mice did it. In 2016, pigs."
It’s the complete lack of respect for old school that hurts the most.
call the cat in here...
"Okay, I guess we’d better make the maze harder."
You mean the drugs were supposed to be for the mice?
"From our experiments, we've concluded that jetpacks are an effective way of getting cheese"
"I told you NOT to use rats from New York City,...the ""rat race"" takes on a whole new meaning there."
"Quite frankly, I don’t know if I’ve ever witnessed a better laid scheme."
Let's just count that one as experimental error.
I blame climate change.
I thought the Pavlovian Resistance Squad was only a rumor.
What hath God rat
It's not cheating; he's just thinking outside the box.
"He has the technology, but SHOULD he have the technology."
"As you can see , mature male rat #007 draws inspiration from his namesake."
I guess this will be a three blind study.
Now let’s see if he can find the cheese.
We need to let  Amazon know that we have finished testing Ratpack pick up service.
This is a blatant disqualification.
If we could only get it to not melt the cheese when he lands
CRISPR may be having unintended consequences...
The gouda made him gassy so I went with it on this one.
I think subject 5 has outgrown the maze.
These young mice are in such a hurry these days.
Stupid mouse.  He's going to burn the cheese with his rocket pack.
I’ll let you be lead author on the journal paper.
His sponsor is Elon Musk.
Check out Elon Mousk over here.
I wonder how the monkeys are doing
Cheating little rat!
See what!?
The Behavioral Research Lab just got awesome!
He locates the cheese in seconds ... he spends most of his time showing off for the female mice in cage 42.
I guess our work is done?
That's the 'Elon Musk-Rat'.
4.92 seconds - I win - take off your shirt.
We might need to rethink our test parameters.
Algernon?
Intelligence has become very hard to measure.
"But, he's from the control group!"
why do we always get the leftovers from NASA?
It says to put a farmers wife at the end of the maze.
"Well, that is thinking out of the maze."
"Geeez, Marge, I think this one has gone and disqualified himself!"
He's clearly in the placebo group because the others built drones.
Should I write this one down as risk aversion or risk-seeking behavior?
"I guess we need a code for ""jet-packed"" now."
I've only seen this behavior in seals before.
He's going to want a nice Barolo with that.
"Well, no more denying; the time has come to upgrade our lab equipment."
"Yes, technically, he is cheating, but he did find the cheese in record time."
Definitely not part of the placebo group.
The test paradigm didn't cover this.
We'll need a different intelligence test.
OSHA compliance overseer. He’ll be out of here soon enough.
"Yeah it’s impressive but he’s ignoring the cheese. He’s heading toward the fridge. My lunch is in there, Linda."
I think they're catching on.
"I don't like cheese , bitch."
It’s a Federal government mouse. That explains its cheating.
We shouldn't have let him see that the cheese is plastic.
Looks like he just joined the Jet Rat Pack
He's auditioning for the sequel: The Mouse That Soared
I knew they were up to something when they asked for jet engine fuel.
Did you put smart water in his bottle?
"Well, he did say he was lactose intolerant."
Maybe we shouldn't have let them watch that episode of 'How It's Made'.
I’d suspect he’s overthinking this.
We should never have implied that the moon is made of cheese.
"Biology 101, question your assumptions."
"Why are you offended, Tina? I'm just trying to explain how a maze works."
"Well, he did build that better mouse trap last time."
"Truly, the cheese has been moved."
I think he has claustrophobia
The economics of same day delivery just got a lot better.
"One small step for mice, one giant leap for moon cheese"
This one must be a Muskrat.
"Well, we didn't control for THIS variable..."
M.I.T . Mouse
"Seal the lab, now!"
We should remember never to start the experiment with Elon Mouse.
Now the others are whining they want one just like it.
He has an unfair advantage. Should we kick him out?
The same mouse that could do this couldn't make its own cheese?
We injected this one with venture capital.
"We just don't calculate for rapid technological leaps, do we?"
The gene-spliced opposable thumb seems to have worked.
"It proves there is hope for advancing Trump’s decision making skills, as long as he likes cheese."
I told you mouse is better than joystick...
"For energy level, just write “jet fuel”."
"Technology is not exactly killing behavioral psychology, but it sure is speeding up getting results."
"If he can navigate the labyrinthine bureaucracy of the next experiment, then I’m ready to put him in charge of the lab."
I don't understand these Millennial mice. How is building a jetpack easier than just running the maze?
I just feel like we’re hitting a wall with this study.
PETA insists the corners must be rounded.
"Wow, that escalated quickly."
The power of cheese stinking outside the box.
We gotta up our game.
Is this the one that went to MIT?
He says Elon Musk had better cheese.
We don’t award points for creativity.
You think he's ready for the next rat race?
Maybe we underestimated his intelligence.
"Well, technically he found it fastest."
This one took the placebo.
They’ve evolved.
"He's bending the rules. But you have to admit, he's progressing quite rapidly."
This adds a third dimension to our study. I’ll fix the spreadsheet.
That's 'cause he used to handle deliveries for Amazon.
They're learning.
If you give a mouse ‘an introduction to thermodynamics’
Subject exhibits remarkable improvement in attitude - not to mention altitude and airspeed.
"After a review of your subjects' test scores, we have to let you go. Not a simple maze completed."
She won’t even do the maze if it’s Brie.
The interns call him Elon Muskrat.
Natural selection?
It doesn't change the fact that the scientific method requires a negative hypothesis.
where did you say you got him from?
And that's just with half-dose.
We've lost control of our control group.”
At the Jet Propulsion Lab they learned about grilled cheese.
I think the brain study team will want to see this.
Onto the human trials...
"Aw, too bad. I like it when we stump ‘em."
"It is a new record, but he cheated!"
What's the reward now?
I'm not sure genetically enhanced rats was such a great idea!
I told you that the independent variable shouldn’t have been Mythbusters
I knew we shouldn't have played Elton John during the study.
I told you we shouldn’t use NASA’s leftover mice.
"As long as this mouse doesn't explode, the Pfizer backpack should be ready for human trials."
Do you think that's cheating?
"We are similar species after all, it was just a matter of time."
His other startup bores the holes into the cheese.
"The Institutional Review Board has requested more information about our research protocol."""
She knows how to get to it.  The problem is she hates limburger.
Do you still think the world will beat a path to our lab now?
At least I am tenured.
I see now why you named him ‘Elon.’
His resume claims he used to deliver packages for Amazon.
It would appear that the key to Evolution is upgrading the cheese.
"Looks like Bob read ""Who Moved My Cheese"" to the mice again last night."
"Say what you will,but he remembered where to find the cheese."
He’s only hurting himself by cheating..
"Ok, now that we’ve successfully trained a rat to use a jet pack, tell me again how this will benefit man-kind?"
I'm surprised the group with goggles is doing so well!
"| heard once you should dress | for the job you want and not |  the job you have, so...”"
"Rough day, huh?"
Watching Mandalorian has really affected this one.
If this succeeds it could really kill the maze business!
It's on his bucket list.
I certainly hope it isn't from the control group.
Do you think the report should at least footnote that we reduced the jet thrust?
Can we go back to building better traps now?
He's got a thing for smoked Swiss.
I try to ignore him but he just keeps mocking me.
Where did he find goggles that small?
Who gave him the helmet?
No wonder Mickey didn't want the job!
"Well, Bob did say to think outside the box."
I thought I warned you about buying rats from 5-star restaurants
Now we know why Swiss cheese has holes
I think we underestimated the female rats.
"RatBond: “The Quantum of Cheddar”,  I’ve written a great script."
"These rats are from the upper east side, let's use brie."
He calls himself Elon Mouse.
We’re going to need a peer review.
This will take the replication crisis to a whole new level.
This one thinks out of the box.
At least we now know who has been stealing the lab's rocket fuel.
"Ok, let's stop here and talk to the dolphins first."
Subject seems to have used other methods of solving the maze..
"Despite our efforts to disrupt it, their jet propulsion program has reached beta testing."
He makes a delicious queso
Trump wants to weaponize Pizza Rat.
"Okay, no more French cheeses."
"Quick, get the copyright on ""jet-pack-lab-rat""..."
"Go get the Parmesan.  Wait, no...the Parmigiano-Reggiano."
Another failure. Over ten minutes and it still isn't at the cheese.
I don't think we can allow them to play video games anymore
"At least they get free healthcare out of these trials."""
"It’s progress, but it’s no hoverboard."
He knows where the cheese is.  He just wanted a faster way to get to it.
"The results are clear, your intelligence potion does not improve maze performance."
"Life, uh, finds a way."
We may need to revise the grades beyond pass/fail.
We need to pump the brakes on the Marvel movies.
Dairy intolerant I'm afraid.
"Okay fine, honey. I’m sorry I said your animal behavior research isn’t rocket science."
Yeh....show me the cheese!
Now I see why you named him Elon Mouse.
I told you he was an over-a-cheeser.
"I think this one wants a scholarship"""
Did you use gruyere this time?
"We're researchers, not referees - so what if they cheat?"
We made no progress on our cancer research but we did build this adorable jet pack
Do you see the glasses too?
Oh great...that's ruined the experiment and now we've learnt nothing.
She says she’s Mouse;: Minnie Mouse.
Call Malcom Gladwell.
Get better cheese – she only took the wine.
This is the mouse we injected with the Chuck Norris strain.
He goes by Elon Mouse.
You see? Circumvention is human nature.
"Ok, now let's put the roof on."
"Have the test subjects demonstrated any additional human-like capacities, such as for vengeance?"
"Well, if nothing else, we've proven that necessity really is the mother of invention."
What we get for accepting a NASA grant.
This should boost our chances for that Amazon research grant.
Now that's REALLY thinking out of the maze
It says the maze endowment ran out in 1974.
I think our days here are numbered.
"Not funny, Ralph. Now take off that silly costume."
Game changer!
"Dr. Bleetstein, this looks to be the sign of an elevated intellect."
Didn't I say there'd be trouble if we let Peabody from Aeronautics recommend interns for us?
So much for training him to run the maze.
"This one has a ""Jetsons"" disorder."
This Millennial strain of rat seeks instant gratification.
I’m thinking Algernon just one-upped Charlie.
I just asked him if he had any other smart ideas.
"Until he sticks that landing, we’ll never know if we succeeded in making him lactose intolerant."
For the love of cheeses!
I blame You-Tube
When you give a mouse a cookie...
You can ignore outfliers.
Did you get these mice from NASA?
"Maybe we should have set some guidelines?"""
"I'll never accept funding from AARP again,"
What did you expect? When you give a mouse venture capital...
He says he ordered the whole charcuterie.
I didn't even know they made helmets that small.
"What a shame, Rosco failed to run the course. I thought he had promise."
This could be a new record.
"Janet, pass me my iPhone. This will go viral."
"His great, great grandfather was the pioneer mazer.  Just let him fly, get his cheese, and leave it out of the report."
Enjoy your launch break.
"To the moon, Alice"
What exactly did you put in the cheese?
We exclude the outliers.
"But he still didn’t actually memorize the maze, so he gets an F. That should discourage the others from cheating."
Told you.
Dock 2 points for recklessness and disregarding lab emissions requirements.
That proves his IQ is over 120.  We can't use him in any other experiments.  Put him back in the sewer.
He's from Mouse Team 6?
What are we doing wrong? Why can't they invent hoverboards?
This is the one they call 'Elon Mouse'
"But is he really _thinking_ Dana, that's the question"
"Nothing special, just a fight or flight response."
We increased her research budget this quarter.
She actually came to us from Amazon's lab.
Now does he go for the Swiss or salvation?
The scary part is his fleas told him how to make it.
Think we'll have to penalize him for going off course.
"He can launch, but he can't cut the cheese.  Not exactly amazing."
The third time’s the cheese.
I think he's the one that was gnawing on the Physics Textbook.
Ras in crise
You should never have named him Geronimo.
You agreed to not give him an HOV lane
So far he's the only one who thought outside the box!
I told you not to name him MacGyver.
I have no answer for this.
Too bad he's lactose intolerant.
This beats carrying a slice of pizza down subway stairs.
He’s part of the test group that watched Iron Man.
"Well, we are studying evolution, after all."
Don't be too impressed. It's no flying car.
The brain serum seems to work better since we added cheese to the equation.
We are testing a prototype for Amazon
Better dial back the NZT.
This participant was funded by Elon Musk.
I can retire now.  They finally solved the maze.
next time we’ll see what the little fucker does when we put his ass in the dishwasher — try to MacGyver your way out of that one you little shit
I think we’re taking this 3 blind mice thing a little too seriously !
"I think it's learned to ""think outside the box""."
It's not the vertical mouse I asked for.
I see he's learned how to think outside the box.
So does this mean we can go home now?
Research shows that making the wall into a maze won't work either.
"Yeah the human race is doomed, but on the plus side his results are off the charts"
I guess that's one way to get the cheese...
"Does he know what comes next?"""
So the space rats came in with their own equipment?
Suicidal.  Lactose and gluten intolerant.
He transferred from the aerospace program.
"Rat pack"" has a certain swing to it"
The rat did really think outside the box
That's cheating - don't record it.
We didn't anticipate he'd invent the Rat Jet Pack
Sharon and I broke up. I told her I needed some space.
Kill them all. Destroy your notes. The world must never know.
Looks like the treatment worked.
"You know, we got rid of natural selection a while back."
"In hindsight, we probably shouldn't have lined the cage with an Elon Musk essay."
We got fooled again...
"If our research  is correct, it clearly shows Swiss cheese is brain food."
Have we tried cheddar yet?
"No, still no signs of flight shame."
"Marry me, and take me away from this rat race."
I think Mr. Bezos will like these results.
Whatever happened to our luddite rats?
I still think this round of tests on the effects of  GMO cheese are  not 100% conclusive.
"He said he needed to have ""the big picture""."
‘We call this experiment A Few Good Mice and Men.”
"As impressive as that is, it kind of defeats the purpose.  Don't you think?"""
He's sponsored by Elon Musk.
"These mice were smart to start with, but now it looks like they've gotten into technology."
"I told you to order the new mice from the Genetic Testing Lab, not the Jet Propulsion Lab."
There's nothing to explain once we label it as experimental error.
"Generation Y, they were born with technology in their hands."
At least it's not using a drone.
Maybe we should go back to the Gen-X rats. These millennials don't like to follow the rules.
This one is from the Upper East Side.
"'He sure has trained us."""
"Martha, does my coat make me look frumpy?"
There’s nothing on the checklist for creative technology
I agree he cheated but I am clueless about how to log this into our research results.  Wait ... it's like HE is testing US!
Did you grab one of the gene-editted ones?
Fascinating.  I did not see that coming.
Maybe some crackers?
We're going to need a lot more cheese!
"I guess it is Limburger."""
Actually he knows how to solve the maze.   The jump pack is just to make the fondue.
He insists on diet and exercise.
So that's what happened to the missing drone kit!
"And we've been spending all of time 
trying to build a better mousetrap."
"He thinks he's here to be a contestant on ""The Amazing Race""."
Why didn’t we think of that?
Give him an A++ for effort.
Looks like we are finally able to prove that the cheese stands alone!
"Yes, I'm sure you build great walls, but I just don't see how that will solve the problem..."
I told him that this could be the game changer. Do you agre?
Don't you think it would be better to start them at the OTHER end?
It’s unbelievable! I can’t believe he didn’t cite your 2016 paper on rocket propulsion.
He always insists on doing cardio first.
"Well, we did hear he wants to transfer to the NASA testing lab."
If we could only figure out how he got the funding
I didn't realize what an incentive 20 year old cheddar would be.
"But then, it’s failing to complete the maze."
I told you this would make him an asshole. It always does.
"Darn it, | forgot the flag."
He’s thinking out of the box!
"Thinking outside of the box, I'd say"
He keeps cheating!
He seems to be headed for the door.
He's one of the ones we got  from NASA...
I'm not sure how to grade this
This VR Set can not fool me enough!
He’s been binge watching James Bond movies in his off hours.
American? No thank you!
"I was going to name him Elon Mouse-k, but it felt too on the nose."
Better send this one back to NASA.
Well he left the cheese. Who wants a sandwich?
How do we measure his intelligence if he's going to cheat.
"Hmm...Not smart enough for the maze, but this they can do."
We will throw this outlier data out.
We may want to rethink those genetic modifications....
Well this is going to skew the data. Let's put a roof on the maze and start again.
"And believe it or not, he's fueling it with cheese."
Maybe next time you won’t doubt my hypothesis Carolyn.
Now we know how that equipment account got drained so quickly.
I think he was expecting a mild Brie.
Amazing difference using green cheese.
The last one headed straight for the moon. Go figure.
He' never tried this hard. I think he knows he's going to the medical study lab next week.
We have to stop getting our mice from DARPA.
He's definitely the brightest one in his cohort.
"I left for five minutes, came back and this one was hovering over the cheese!"
I guess this is the opposite of building a better mousetrap?
"Jokes on him.  We didn't use real cheese"""
"On the plus side, it looks like your intelligence enhancing cheese is a success!"
Everything evolves.
You said you had blocked their access to Amazon.
Maybe we shouldn't have used your weed-infused cheese?
He ordered it right after we took away his drone.
Elon is thinking outside the maze again.
"I don't know if this is what he meant when he said, ""double blind""."
We really should have thought out giving them access to Amazon Prime.
He actually already had a patent pending for the Rat Pack when I got here.
I think you’ve come up with the right blend of ginkgo biloba to espresso.
Evolution. I guess...
This one’s going above and beyond.
How do I score THIS!?
"That's so Gen Z, am I right?"
Perhaps we shouldn’t have named him’Elon’.
"Well Linda, you said make the maze easier..."
The rats from Google Labs are  game changers.
Perhaps it was emboldened by the Chinese Lunar Year of The Rat calendar on the wall.
Darn Millenials.
I think he's hovering near a solution.
"Yes, but where did he fuel up?"
"Well, we could just fudge the data and say he built it himself."
Look's like your dosage made him too smart for his own gouda.
This mouse was donated by that actress in the college admissions scandal
"Doc, if i could suggest adding a roof to the design next time?"
"Yes, STEM really does work."
"So, I guess we can leave early for lunch today?"
Does it illustrate a natural tendency towards creative problem solving or is it our artisanal cheese choice is too motivational?
I told you not to put them next to the jetpacks.
Hire the handicapped they said
Impressive. The assembly instructions are in pagalog.
"Hey, the test rats deliver the package 90.6% of the time...except when it’s cheese!"
"Well, he did have to learn to use the jet-pack first."
I guess naming him Orville was a good call
Naming him Elon Mousk was a mistake.
Going down.
"Clearly, this is not her first rodeo."
Somehow he moved the cheese. I smell a rat!
Is this all you got done?
"Thirty years with JPL, and it has come to this."
I think we have to accept that we've been outsmarted by a mouse.
"It’s amazing what they can do with a water bottle, wheel, and cedar chips."
"He just hovers over it, his Carbon Footprint is high but is cholesterol is low."
"Yes, of course it skews the results."
Just think if our Elon applied himself to something constructive.
I'm sure it's just a phase.
"This isn't publishable,is it?"
"""The smart ones focus on the journey not the designation."""
"Must have escaped from a different lab, don't you think?"
"Sir, I think you may have  misunderstood our courtesy shuttle system..."
But can it handle China's new surface-to-air mousetraps?
He’s Bonding.
You shouldn't have asked for same-day delivery.
We need to find another source for animals other than NASA.
"No more mice from Elon Musk, okay?"
He’s been watching The Big Bang Theory.
Swiss...why is it always Swiss?
"Which supplement did he get?"""
This will make Adderall worthless.
Rat with a jet pack is already trending...
We’re going to need a bigger maze budget.
He seems to like the virtual reality version better.
Should we accept that the end justifies the means?
I knew is would happen...we need a 3D maze
It’s confirmed—he’s a pack rat.
It wasn't supposed to be smart
"I don't know. He seemed fine, then he just said ""Fuck it"" and walked out of the maze."
Let’s not give that lab rat so much time in the lab.
Is that the overachiever?
He said that he wanted to think outside the box!
It appears the mouse has elevated his game.
We will need to observe social visits from friends and family members more closely.
"We’ll, there’s nothing in the rule book that forbids it’s use."
"Once again, Rocket Mouse seems to have the edge over the other subjects."
Now THAT'S thinking outside the box!
"As irresistibly charming as these clipboards are, next time we video-tape."
Time to re-evaluate our hypothesis.
"In this test, we’re dealing with it’s aversion to melted cheese."
I am surmising our experiment has been contaminated with the LSD trials.
I hate when he pulls this James Bond stuff.
All our hard work is taking off.
I TOLD you the virtual reality glasses were a bad idea!
They're evolving.
Well he’ll never have to worry about going hungry.
You say this one was sent over from NASA?
"You said ""Let's try the drones.""  Now look what's happened!"
That's not the half of it. It runs off droppings!
"Don't worry, rats are notoriously bad at aerodynamics."
What's the second-place prize?
Relax...We  are going to win the anti-Nobel for most useless invention !
"I didn't expect this, Skinner. It's thinking outside the box."
We also need to build a better mousetrap.
What are we smoking?
"And that’s when I told  my wife. Honey, I need some space"
Walking in the club like excuse me sir
All the best for the SpaceX demo Mr.Musk!
"I am not sure if this is enough but this is the highest we can  go, sir"
Whoa! What the hell? That's not Gouda!
Great.  Now they'll ALL want one.
Can we both agree to never mention this to the IRB?
We should probably dial back the Red Bull dosage.
"Yea, but how does this improve his cognitive skills?"
I'm hungry.
The force is strong with this one but he's really going to skew our results.
"In his defense, Burns said often, not always."
"Time to harvest that sweet, sweet adrenochrome."
"He can fly now, that's why we keep the door closed."
These millennnial mice are a pain in the ass.
Andy Kaufman could have a field day with this.
Jesus Christ that's Jason Bourne.
I think the jet pack is almost ready for Shark Tank!
"Hmm, kinda makes me feel dumb."
He tried a zip line.
We didn't control for that
Did you leave the Amazon app open on your phone?
"Sorry but I think it's too late to try to copyright ""The Rat Pack""."
"Under ""Male / Female"" it says ""All Male"""
"I'm titling my journal article, ""Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH: The Next Generation."""
He bought it on Amazon
Weird. That subject is from the control group.
Do they get extra points for thinking out of the box?
Rat #007?
He said it was a Christmas present
He is officially joining the new rat race.
The white one is demanding his GPS.
How come they got the jetpacks in 2020?
There are holes in your experiment.
That's amazing!I didn't know that they made jetpacks that small.
We told it the moon was made of cheese.
"Wait, it the goal to get the cheese or to get out of the maze?"
"I take it Agent 006 1/2's training is progressing on schedule, Q?"
We should have thought of that.
I warned you not to watch MacGyver during your lunch breaks
It’s a millennial mouse.
It's a shame they defunded the state's Gifted & Talented Program.
Make a note. No more lab rats on space missions.
It's for a new speed dating app.
We have named him Elon Mouse
She says it's called a RAT PACK and she got it from Amazon.
Now that’s a rat pack...
Has the intern been in here again?
Maybe we should stick with cheese and lose the Red bull.
"Well, looks like the space program has been cut again."
He's really flying through this one
All that for a cracker?
And yet he didn't even finish the maze.
Did you notify the FAA about this flight?
We've been underestimating them for years.
Did you remember to attach his parachute?
He used to work at a NASA facility.
"It doesn't matter where we put the cheese or how we change the maze, he's always the fastest finisher."
He’s cheating...
"With Disney+, now everyone's looking for the next Marvel spin-off"
"No surprise there, that's mouse 007."
"They observed the changes the unearned advantage had caused the rat. Left  better situated than 99% of his kind, he chose a tasty treat over emptying the cages."
"He technically  failed the test, but I would say the experiment was an astounding success!"
"Gee, I'm hungry ..."
Another vegan.
Ok. We need a roof.
We have to stop watching DYI...
Imagine what they could do for brie instead of cheddar
That’s the last time I’m buying mice from JPL!
"well, it is good cheese."
Is that allowed?
The other three blind mice ran after the farmer's wife.
Does this count as he found the cheese or not?
Say hello to our new overlords
The ways and means of maze and weans.
Where'd he get the parts?
At least it's not the drone again.
Think of the cheese as tenure.
"Now do you see why we call him ""The Brain?"""
"Technology perfectly suited for humans, being that it’s less efficient and more expensive than walking, of course."
We shouldn’t be surprised; it’s an imported Swiss.
Must have gotten inspired by the Elton John biopic.
Think of it as he's improving our odds for the next grant submission.
I somehow doubt the world will beat a path to our door.
"As long as he doesn't start vaping, I'll allow it."
Well he didn't have breakfast...
I think he's been gunning for my job...
The scariest thing is that I think he also know who moved his cheese.
We need to stop using rats from the early acceptance program.
Now we need a 3-D maze!
"Maybe Space Force could use mice, not men."
Talk about taking the initiative.
She's always been our top lab animal.
I'm thinking it's going to invalidate the results of the study...
Fuck. He found the cheese.
"I have no idea who sent it. All the package said was:


To: Maze Lab 

From: Gene Modification 

Contents: One rat and control unit."
He CLAIMS he’s lactose intolerant.
Looks like Jerry is avoiding his problems again
It looks impressive but he took 100 times longer than average to find the cheese. Progress?
This one learned to think outside the box.
This certainly supports my theory that vegans think out of the box.
"Gracy, it isn't too late to stop this madness..."
It didn't work.
We're going to need more cheese.
That one says he's lactose intolerant...
You know right away which ones have the Rat Stuff.
He's hovering over the ultimate choice: 'grill or don't grill?'
Turns out he's lactose intolerant.
Anything for the cheeeeeese.....
Did you say that was jarlsberg?
I don't have one of those.
"It clearly shows remarkable intelligence, but is it commercially feasible?"
"Well, that's new!"
"We've been able to make great progress with the rats, but I think humans have become too easily distracted to safely operate it."
What a shame. Poor little guy doesn't realize it's processed American cheese.
All I did was make him watch Thunderball.
I named him Musk Mouse.
You were the one that told him he could have the cheese 'when guinea pigs fly'...
He's beating us at our own game.
Is there a ‘superior innovational abilities’ column on your clipboard?
"Yeah, it's a breakthrough - but it's still cheating."
Makes you wonder if the results are skewed.
This iSait4 he
I guess they are learning...
Elon Musk will be pleased.
I think a mouse knows to turn the corners.
Since the lower species still believe in science this was inevitable.
Modern problems require modern solutions.
PAY UP!... The rat wins again...
That piece of cheese has not moved in over an hour.
You just had to name him Elon.
"To me, the biggest proof of intelligence improvement is the helmet."
We forgot to factor in lactose intolerance.
I want a divorce.
James Bond” decided he wouldn’t crawl through the maze like the others.  Had to rise above the rest of them.
Is this the new protocol for the nominee selection process?
He refused to even make the effort until we put out the Emmentaler.
How the Mighty Mouse has fallen.
Are the windows closed? The last time he took off down Broadway.
"Tom and Jerry are working on a helicopter, Mickey used a Segway. It’s a much better cheese than they’re used to."
What do you mean you've lost count?
"Next time, don't name your lab rat ""Tony Stark."""
When I got into this line of work I knew there would be days like this
The corporate Rats seem to love Elon's new equipment.
Not bad but how fast can he get to the cheese without the jet pack?
Science is it's own reward.
"I don’t know what’s going on here, but I don’t like the looks of it!"
"Is she aware of the  gravity of your situation,  Sir?"
"Typical, he's always looking for a short cut."
We never should have let him on Amazon.
I'm afraid he's beaten us.
"Please change the nightly mice video to something besides Thunderball, okay?"
Cheese may work.  Let's try an iPhone.
Maybe we should try Imported
I told you. Nobody likes American cheese. We gotta stretch the budget to French.
"Oh well, let’s blame it on the climate change."
What worries me the most is his unyielding zeal for global conquest.
"Rat drones,we have to call...drone  busters!!!"
He may be after our jobs next.
It’s not easy these days to find a rat that follows instructions.

"Did you ever find that authentic, old fashioned deli in Queens?"
"This furry thing went too far, Elon."
"How do I list this on the report, success or what the heck!?"
cognition increased but do we consider using his mate for rocket fuel a side affect?
What do you expect?  You let them watch Pinky and the Brain.
"You're missing the point. The object isn't to see how fast the mouse can get the cheese, but how much cheese we can get out of the government."
How long do you think it will take him to realize the Moon isn't made of cheese?
"I understand we gave him the jetpack gene, but where'd he find the fuel?"
That's one from the free range batch.
are you sure it was ONLY vegemite?
She broke through the glass ceiling.
"According to the lab dogs, training is complete when they follow me around with the little plastic bags instead of a clip board"
Now the Aston Martin makes sense.
I don’t think they’ll go for dairy free.
It's obvious WE lack imagination!
I only expected the pigs to do this.
We need all the jetpack and cheese data we can get.
This next applicant contends he’s solved the tail-burning issue.
Lab Mouse Powered by Machine Learning
"I think we have ourselves a Mighty Mouse wannabe, ready to blast off."
"Why did we introduce Tesla products in our labs, again?"
"If he was really smart, he'd use it to fly outta here."
"You didn't cancel his YouTube account, did you?"
It's a-maze-ing what these 21st cenury rats will come up with to get a hunk of Gruyère.
They're getting too intelligent...
"Phase one, done. Now that he's airborne, we need to get him a theme song. And maybe a new hat."
I think it was a touch of vertigo.
"Now that's what I call ""Thinking out of the box!"""
"Is he defying labrynthal orthodoxy, ya think?"
The mice from NASA are light years ahead of the rest.
It's the mouse with the Elon Musk DNA.
Typical Millennial!
"Now the question is, did intermittent fasting result in better brain function or is he just *really* hungry?"
I think we reached the point where the program gets shutdown next...
Call Jenkins.  I think we’ve discovered the reason for the decline in the pigeon population.
Our latest results have been through the roof.
Did you go into the Mensa cage again ?

The Chair really has us pushing hard to produce something in response to the Admissions Scandal.
Rodent Downey Jr. in his most ambitious role yet
Maybe we should say the study was about jetpacks?
Must be something he cooked up with the Guinea Pig.
"Some of the assistants have nicknamed him 'Elon Mouse' """

Now there's a possible side effect I could live with.
This one thinks he’s above it all.
It appears Q has lost his focus.
What the hell is a waze?
Can I have Algernon's cheese?

I think we should tell Charlie why he's losing to a mouse.
"He was promised jetpacks, apparently."
"Wow, casomorphin addiction makes anything possible..."
Was the lab assistant watching Mighty Mouse cartoons?
Intrepid is not a trait in our sorting data.

This one doesn’t follow the rules
This is the one we fed in cannabis

I'm a cheese-lover but his enthusiasm is over the top.
...And he only spent a day with Elon Musk.
Should we tell the pigeons?
Let's stop borrowing the engineering' department's rats.
He asked to see our cross-platform promotion strategy first.
It appears to be a random genetic mutation to give this rat an evolutionary advantage
Maybe less fish oil?
Disqualify it. Not everyone can own a jet pack”.
"This rat was mistakenly injected with brain cells, not stem cells."
It'll be a brave new world if they get FDA approval.
We've named this one Bloomberg.
It's safe to say the intelligence drug has an effect.
Do you think they all come with a jet pack?
Engineering department snuck in again last night
I guess they've had enough.
It's called...evolution.
Send his resume to YouTube.
The mouse thought this would be more efficient.
He has really exceeded all our expectations for the cheese!
Amazon has high expectations for this study...!
"Jetpack, Ratpack...it's all elite."

Did you get the Whole Foods cheese again?
Just imagine what might be accomplished with sharper cheese.
You'd think the little fucker could figure out how to get out of his Habitrail.
It's going to have to be at least three times bigger for human trials.
When did he get the jet pack?
He won't land until we include the design patent.
I think 'mice can fly' is a bit misleading.
...the Department of Defense is never going to believe this...
That always happens with the Gouda.
Should have put a top on it.  I knew he got that for Christmas.
Well.. I wouldn't call it a side effect
"It was just a question of time, Marge. That’s what evolution is all about."
"I don't care how advanced his discovery is, I still think it's cheating."

"OK - This disproves our original hypothesis."""
It says here he's been accepted by Mensa.
Look what happens when we remove the glass ceiling.
Who taught him to rappel?
Let's present this as a trendy 'Escape Room'...
Let's just put 'Results are inconclusive.'
Superior technical adaptation skills noted.....
He's just showing off. Rats don't even like cheese.
Another 45 years of development and then maybe humans will be ready for the jetpack!

We should probably cut back on the vitamins.
"Technically, he is known as ""subject B47"", but we have affectionately named him Elon Mousk."
"Subject completed the maze, but looked considerably less cool without the tasseled jumpsuit."
He heard that the moon is made of cheese.
"Without Brain, Pinkie was finally able to flourish ..."
What was in the cheese we used in yesterday’s runs?
Good! He found the cheese. Let's reset the maze with some peanut butter and see how he does.
Now I know why they put the mouse in charge of the lab.
"Told you, smoking it makes it way tastier."
The Algernon strain is supposed to be off limits.
For the next test we'll have him order for delivery.
Do you think we should rename this room the Skylab?
I told you; buying Gouda is always worth it.
"That's the third one this week!"""
Test #1048 - Replaced gouda with a mild Jarlsberg.
It's a giant leap for mousekind
"The new batch of mice were breed at MIT, and are really too advanced for our work."
We need to revise the entry rules.
I think we underestimated this one.
Does this mean I can have his cheese..?
You really think Amazon will use mice instead of drones?
We should've never watched the Mandalorian on the lab TV.
That bastard is cheating again

I suspect we were hacked by the Russians
We provided this one with access to Amazon.
He's passed every test we've thrown at him
And that's after only 1 week on steriods
I need to check the protocol. I think the electric models are permitted.
"Yes, impressive but that's a placebo mouse, so disregard it."
Subject A0459: exposed to five episodes of Rick and Morty.
It might be better if we pick the equipment.
He's also enrolled in the PhD program.
since when did mice think outside the box?
Just give him the cheese. This maze is for blind mini mice.
"Either way, I'm not so sure it's ready for human testing."
I told you it wasn't a good idea to separate him from his little pink friend.
"Well, this isn't working out any better than the bats."
That jetpack should be a real game changer.
It appears the rats are gaining on the humans.
We are all very proud of the creativity young Rodney shows in some of his maze runs; but you must make sure he stays below the walls.

"No worries, outliers are perfectly normal."
"„Some quite enhancing drugs, wouldn‘t you say?“"
But do you think the makeup is safe for humans?
These Millennial mice are too tech savvy.
It seems he wants to grill the cheese by himself.
"Technically, it’s a disqualification. He should be going through the maze."
Which cage did you say he came from?
"We’re all set on the running course, but the biking and swimming events need more work."
So that's what happened to McGyver's exercise wheel.
"They've certainly evolved, no doubt about that."
And yesterday little Elon invented this a-m-a-z-e-i-n-g rat pack.
How much cheddar are we putting into this research?
He's really wild about manchego.
I suggest a lower quality cheese next time.
It's the Amazon prototype we've been working on.
We're going to have to find a better way to hide the cheese.
"the subject, Mr. Sniffles, is responding spectacularly, ma'am. he’s using the proffered technology to problemsolve in wholly novel ways. it's like second nature. i’ve noted the following: my king, real player shit, grinding for that cheese, maze god"
You should see the mouse trap”
He transferred from Bell Labs.
Have you seen where my energy drink went?
I think it didn't work this time because he likes brie better.
And all we had to do was switch from American to Swiss? Huh.
I guess this supports your theory about having thumbs.
We underestimated the incentive power of cheese.
He said he's preparing for the rat race.
And this one got the placebo.
What were you saying about when pigs can fly?
This one appears to be leaving the Rat race in the dust
you need to stop taking your work home with  yo

"I told you naming him ""Elon Muskrat"" would only lead to trouble."
"Well, if that doesn't prove that necessity is the Mother of invention, nothing will"
"He learned the maze last week.  Now, we’re testing for speed."
I think we have the winner of this rat race.
''So... do you think it passed the test?''
He was in that night course.
"He thought you said ""amazing""."
Please tell me you didn't use the Stilton.
And you said they weren’t watching how to videos on YouTube!
I'm not surprised.  We had him pegged as a high flier early on.
He's an outlier
This one's going to skew the hell out of our statistics.

"It’s a delivery company called 
A-mouse-zon."
He arrived at my house for dinner last week.
"Ya know, we’ve been  debating whether to call it the 9th floor or the 9th tier"

Are we monitoring its night time activities?
We want to find out if mice are as racist as humans.
"Did you tell him it's very rare and found only in the Swiss Alps?"""
This proves my theory that rats aren't afraid of heights.
Is this what they mean by a rat race?
"That’s funny. When I was  a kid, I wanted to be an elevator operator."
This is why we only use white mice
Maybe we shouldn't have accepted that grant from Elon Musk?
Maybe it just doesn't like cheese.
"Well, that's just cheating."
I told you that Muenster was exceptionally good.
There's always one who thinks he's smarter.
"He had a bad attitude, but he was always the smartest in the class."
The Space X logo is the most baffling!!
We could have just used kangaroo rats.
I think it might be time to update our design.
Perhaps we should inform HR that Dimitrov and Natasha may have been telling the truth about the missing jet fuel.
"I’m getting a real ‘Flowers for Algernon’ vibe here. You know, ‘Flowers for Algernon?’ ‘Ignorance is bliss?’ 1959 short story by Daniel Keyes? Jesus, Gloria, read a fucking book."
We may need to revisit the experimental design.
Clever and antisocial; must be Aspergers.
"Finally, some realization of the promise that technology will allow us to escape the rate race...."

Life was so much simpler then....
He somehow slipped through the cracks.
He says this cheese will be perfect for his quiche recipe.

I think for the first time ever we'll be able to proudly say that this drug was tested on animals. He's a genius.
He told me he was getting tired and couldn't walk any further.
I think this one was bred with the X-games chromosome.
The pay-to-win option may be skewing our results.
Isn't evolution amazing?
"Tell me, how does our study protocol account for outright cheating?"
"Forget the maze, when did you teach him to steal the prototype from next door?"
"Now he says he's sick of the ratrace and on strike""."
But we're not testing them for memory. We're testing them for ingenuity.
This changes everything.
This doesn't get us anywhere.
I think we made the maze too hard.
Perhaps it's from the Jet Propulsion Lab.
I hope this one isn't lactose intolerant like the last one.
I told you to leave the glass ceiling alone.
I was told he has a steep learning curve
He said he's moving to Canada.

At least I won't worry about AI anymore.
It's too bad this one can't run for political office.
"If you had read ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,"" as I told you to, you'd understand"
He forgot his clipboard again.  We told him what would happen.
"I'm postulating that the energy used equals the mouse's mass times the smell of the cheese squared."""
Years of trial and error have taught me how to get my research grant extended.
We shouldn't have named him Elon
"I guess he felt the need, the need for cheese."
That must be some pretty fantastic cheese.
I hope this one's more cooperative.  The last one called 911.
I'd better go close the window.
i think the mice are talking of over with their technology!
He outsmart us.
This one seems to have a jump on the rest.
Just a-mazing!

"Even Millenial Mice are spoiled, it looks like cheese is not enough for them anymore"
He doesn't seem to like the gorgonzola.
"Right, very cute.  How COULD it hurt to allow him a backpack?"
Think it's too easy?

It’s the only way I could get him to come for his rehabilitation appointments.
"And I think it's gonna be a long long time
'Till touch down brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no no no I'm a rocket man"

I know you set this up
They rejected the camembert
I'm not really sure what we expected but I didn't expect this.
This is taking spatial learning of a maze to a whole new level

Necessity is the mother of invention.
"First,it will have to pass the flight test."
Don't take it so hard. Every industry gets disrupted eventually.
Where's our jet packs?
Ellon Mousek
We should increase the walls by 6 inches.
Do you want to write that UP?
He's overachieving.
He'll never learn a thing this way.
And thus began the mouse take-over.
We can use the grant on something else if we ditch this ridiculous maze
Didn't anyone read him the rules?
We increased the size of the cheese to stimulate his inventiveness.
Another drone user test complete!

So this is what Frank Sinatra's Rat Pack was up to
This is what happens when Elon Musk gets involved.
Make a note to cut down on his Red Bull.
I have a theory on where he gets the fuel pellets for the solid rocket boosters.
"If pack rats are a thing, then jet-pack rats must be, too."
Well this makes all the current mousetraps obsolete.
"He's leaving, he's lactose intolerant."
And that's why I said don't use a Musk rat
He was chosen to be the first mouse on Mars. We always make sure he gets the cheese.
Is that the one that’s always doing the Orson Welles impression?
Let's stop lining their cages with Sharper Image.
"He's not exactly Mighty Mouse, but..."

this really does not help our carbon footprint
I call him liddle' rocket mouse.
He hired a lobbyist.
Is that covered under the budget?
"We left the window open, didn't we?"
I'm also worried about the integrity of the experiment.
That explains the tiny TV walking up the stairs
Noted: #24 doesn't do lactose
Well that's going to screw up the Bell Curve!
Is it just a coincidence that we named this one Elon?
A jet pack for the rat pack
Is this the one with the modified JTPCK gene?
Another escapee from the Silcon Valley lab.

Our planet is so doomed! Rats are getting super creative in escaping this sinking ship!
Keep in mind that's just one sample.
he must have watched the james bond movie last night
So.....can I eat that cheese now?
"Think he found the maze is kinda unneeded,,cheesy? I guess"
He just flew in the open window!
Death is not the end.
He doesn’t like his study arm assignment!
We're gonna need bigger walls.

DO WE REALLY NEED AN IMPARTIAL JUDGE?
Now he's demanding Gorgonzola Dolce.
This is the result of crossbreeding mice with bats.

We have implanted a new gene that makes the mouse eat the cheese and then cut the cheese.
What if he doesn't like Limburger?
Some rat squealed.
"I suggest we document his pitch, yaw and roll."
That's the one with the Elon Musk gene implant.
Looks like he MacGyvered the mousetrap.
Ok that's a cool mouse!!!
Are you sure this will help us understand the Senate?
"I think he may have gotten into the Gama irradiated cheese."""
uh... where did he get that?
It would appear that Mr. Go Go Gadget Ratigan has managed to solve the mystery of the maze.
We need to up our game on the maze for these mice coming over from the Tesla lab.
"OK, this is the last time we’re running tests on the Elon Muskrat."
Let R&D know we need to up the better mousetrap budget.

How far do you go up?

its the 10th floor already and i'm starting to belive they made these 10 stars up
"Let me guess, going up?"
Next stop Mars.
Where we did get a rat-sized jetpack?
"You're supposed to walk, not fly"
We should never have put him on that engineering course
Did it just break the glass ceiling or did we forget to put it on again?
So that's what happened to my mini jetpack.
"I think the lactose intolerance drug needs a bit more work, Gayle."
"So, what’s new?"
narf!
I don't know whether to ding him on his inability to see the cheese right in front of him or call him genius for making that tiny jet-pack.

How ‘bout fondue tonight
What did you think would happen?

I guess they weren't hungry before they left.
Cat got your tongue?
"OK, he’s playing three-dimensional cheese."
"Mickey heard some bees are drones, so not to be outdone. . ."

The pigeons are going to be pissed.
I say we just get a different rat.
Stuart got very frustrated after losing his car; now he's all about flying

This one is too anal.
I told you Elon mouse was going to create emissions pointlessly.
He's one of our lunar trainees.
"We could praise this mouse for making a jet pack but I think the real takeaway is that this dumbass can’t run a simple maze. Like “Oh, I have to walk across the street, better build a car!” That’s this stupid fucking mouse talking. Total moron mouse."

Who’ll handle play by play?
IT had no other clean clothes
"The crisper modifications have had an effect!  Unfortunately, a small piece of cheese is no longer his prime motivator!"

Now what do we do? The mice are giving up dairy...
A-maze-ing. Now he’s just showing off. Wouldn’t you agree Bob?

"I would call the latest drug results as positive.""
""I wonder if he can teach us to do that too?"

These experiments with geriatric rats are getting just ridiculous.
Next time be sure to use a less piquant fromage.
You get it? Isn’t it a-MAZE-ing?
"Our next fear, rat drones."
We should shut this experiment down before he learns to go nuclear!
"Now that we tested it on mice, how exactly do we get a large enough cheese block to get humans to use jet packs?"
I would try the Camembert.
I guess this means we will need a lot more cheese.
Jetpack for Algernon... what a great idea!
I think it's no a good idea to utilize the same rat in more than  twenty trials...
"He must be amazed"""

Do you think R&D time would be more impressive if we upgrade to the Camenbert?
Should we call it the rat pack jet or the backpack jet rat?
We are scientists.
"Mouse, cheese, rat race. Check. Now -- why do we keep doing this?"
Due to the significant reduction in our funding we have to conduct our research significantly quicker
The design of your experiment does say the mouse would go blindly through the chutes for the reward.

What are we trying to prove here?
We made him watch too many action films!
"Well, will you look at that, Franny Frumin!"
They are in there somewhere.
"I told you that we’ve just got to stop using these mice with MENSA cards, it’s skewing our data."

I asked Captain Maze for his assessment.
I don't think we'll save the day.
I told you not to give him his pilot's license!
Why make them work so hard for a lousy piece of cheese?
Well at least we taught them how to jump...…..

"Hmmm, we have a cheater in our midst"
"''No blindfold is unfair,give him a chance"""
It's time to move on to 3D mazes.
First time I've actually seen thinking outside the box.
They want him to be trained as a drone but he can't fly.
We’re going to have to rethink the whole maze thing...
The subject seems to be super-cheesed about this particular maze.
We shouldn't have done the experiment where we left him near the computer with a credit card.
"One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind ‘  ,Oh ok, you must be heading up to COP 25‘"
Write your caption here  I just want some  me time

Just how many human brain cells did you give him?
Jealous?
It really seems it will be the year of the rat.
He's getting ready for Space Force.

"Yeah, Super Mouse is a good name"
I suppose cheese will do that if you're a clever rat.
"Well, he got a birthday cake from his brother, yesterday......"
"Augh, I hate when the mice escape."
We bred this strain to think outside the box.
He has started smoking Marlboro too

OMG we've taught them to fly!
"Could be the TV program about AI the lab staff was watching, but he has also has been sipping Redbull."""
"To be fair, it's not rocket science."
He's achieved lift but his directional stability is flimsy.
I'm sure he'll make it to the White House in no time
I think we're gonna need more cheese.
We need to replace that old cheese before the rats outside the building smell it.
WTH?
"Science, bitch."
I told you we shouldn’t have fueled up his jetpack.
Do we give him points for cheating or do we demote him?
What? It was too cold in  my faux fur coat...
We found this one in the attic of Elon Musk.
They've become much more industrious since we switched to Murray's.
