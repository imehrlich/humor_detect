6050,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,Could you please turn down the volume a bit? They're having heat strokes in the choir loft.
6077,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,This isn't what I meant when I asked for a hot new sound!
6143,3621,3,12,60,75,1.24,0.059547845854790976,608,Because they're saying your music isn't so hot
6162,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,"Hot, hot, hotter than Hell..."
6176,3621,0,18,57,75,1.24,0.049647405419265024,608,Play a nice warm-up hymn before my sermon for the building-fund
6192,3621,1,16,58,75,1.24,0.05315284776213995,608,I ordered the Calypso steel drums and they sent us this.
5710,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,Not what I meant by ‘bring the heat’
3652,3621,1,16,58,75,1.24,0.05315284776213995,608,"Hot air travels down a pipe from the pulpit, circulates the radiator, and is released into the nave by means of the foot pedals. This is a large church, so any quiet passages should still be played con brio."
3528,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,So next time skip the Dies irae.
3556,3621,4,10,61,75,1.24,0.06250045044882722,608,I can warm their hearts or I can lift their spirits--I can't do both.
920,3621,0,18,57,75,1.24,0.049647405419265024,608,They want some hot tunes for next week's wedding.
946,3621,3,12,60,75,1.24,0.059547845854790976,608,It turns out that Catholic Priests are real suckers for a hot organ.
948,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,It's a steam organ. Fire her up and let's see what she can do.
975,3621,4,10,61,75,1.24,0.06250045044882722,608,Hate to break it to you but size actually does matter.
988,3621,3,12,60,75,1.24,0.059547845854790976,608,The parishioners' board wants hymns with hotter rhythms. I scored this baby from a cathedral they're renovating.
993,3621,1,16,58,75,1.24,0.05315284776213995,608,"We thought your playing might improve if you ""warmed up"" first."
997,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,Let's see Him try to ignore these pipes!
1012,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,"I must admit, that hymn was banging."
1019,3621,3,12,60,75,1.24,0.059547845854790976,608,It helps me warm up before big concerts.
1021,3621,3,12,60,75,1.24,0.059547845854790976,608,The parishioners say my music is hot.
1066,3621,3,12,60,75,1.24,0.059547845854790976,608,I asked for a warm sound when I ordered the system. Let's see what it can do.
1091,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,...it just looks hot.
1158,3621,0,18,57,75,1.24,0.049647405419265024,608,The A sounds flat -- and a bit gurgly.
1172,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,I'm on a mission - the radiator from the refectory is missing.
890,3621,1,16,58,75,1.24,0.05315284776213995,608,"Sorry sir, but we can only play at one volume, loud, and only between the hours of 10pm and 3am."
1191,3621,3,12,60,75,1.24,0.059547845854790976,608,"Yes, it's called Steammunk music."
1237,3621,3,12,60,75,1.24,0.059547845854790976,608,"Yas, Charles, it is quite hot. I'm afraid you'll have to cool it down a bit for the bishop's visit."
1241,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,It plays like a dream once it warms up.
1246,3621,3,12,60,75,1.24,0.059547845854790976,608,"It was hyperbole Brother Jacob, although now it's only ironic"
1273,3621,5,8,62,75,1.24,0.06531972647421809,608,"It gets the same sound as a normal pipe organ, Father, and it was much cheaper!"
1316,3621,4,10,61,75,1.24,0.06250045044882722,608,"I see it as a splendid opportunity to perform Handel's lesser-known masterpiece, ""Water Hammer Music."""
1346,3621,0,18,57,75,1.24,0.049647405419265024,608,"We're going to get some heat from above, for spending that much on this."
1376,3621,4,10,61,75,1.24,0.06250045044882722,608,It's a little cold in here. Please turn up the heat.
1400,3621,3,12,60,75,1.24,0.059547845854790976,608,I had it specially made for the Presidential Inauguration
1427,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,Fine. So long as you don’t bleed it on Easter.
1444,3621,1,16,58,75,1.24,0.05315284776213995,608,I never knew the German Baroque could sound so warm.
1469,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,Play well and God will keep us warm
1501,3621,3,12,60,75,1.24,0.059547845854790976,608,Can you play something that ratiates?
1556,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,This should warm up the congtegation
1618,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,I like my cantatas piping hot.
1209,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,"Full steam ahead Father, the Ave Maria needs more zing!"
1619,3621,3,12,60,75,1.24,0.059547845854790976,608,"Can you do, ""Knock, knock knockin' on heaven's door?"""
754,3621,3,12,60,75,1.24,0.059547845854790976,608,Do you know 'Steam Heat'?
737,3621,3,12,60,75,1.24,0.059547845854790976,608,This is one of those cartoons that doesn’t need a caption.
133,3621,3,12,60,75,1.24,0.059547845854790976,608,This is a church. We don't need hot tunes.
142,3621,1,16,58,75,1.24,0.05315284776213995,608,On Sunday I want you to really bring the heat.
168,3621,4,10,61,75,1.24,0.06250045044882722,608,"Hey, I blow hot air too."
194,3621,4,10,61,75,1.24,0.06250045044882722,608,"Bah. Ever since the re-tune I try to play Bach but all that comes out is ""Toccatta & Clank in 'MP3 Maligner.'"""
224,3621,3,12,60,75,1.24,0.059547845854790976,608,And you thought I was full of hot air.
249,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,Have you asked the Super?
271,3621,3,12,60,75,1.24,0.059547845854790976,608,You should have called an organ tuner not a plumber
346,3621,3,12,60,75,1.24,0.059547845854790976,608,Now we'll have to air condition the choir loft.
351,3621,4,10,61,75,1.24,0.06250045044882722,608,I can't hear anything over the knocking.
355,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,I like the symbolism; turning up the heat on sinners.
366,3621,5,8,62,75,1.24,0.06531972647421809,608,"When I asked you to have someone replace the pipes on the organ, I really had something very different in mind..."
383,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,It radiates joy in the Lord.
394,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,Listening to Mannheim Steamroller again?
411,3621,3,12,60,75,1.24,0.059547845854790976,608,I pray this isn't just a pipe dream.
751,3621,1,16,58,75,1.24,0.05315284776213995,608,Can't you play anything besides 'Steam Heat'?
433,3621,0,18,57,75,1.24,0.049647405419265024,608,It's function over form in this church.
550,3621,0,18,57,75,1.24,0.049647405419265024,608,"First, hot yoga. Now, this?"
563,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,"Father, with those set of pipes, you’ll really be able to heat up this joint."
578,3621,1,16,58,75,1.24,0.05315284776213995,608,Your playing always leaves me cold.
615,3621,3,12,60,75,1.24,0.059547845854790976,608,Did someone say to radiate your organ?
643,3621,1,16,58,75,1.24,0.05315284776213995,608,"Reverend, your playing is simply radiant!"
650,3621,3,12,60,75,1.24,0.059547845854790976,608,It wouldn't be so bad except for the pinging
658,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,Now you can really do justice to Handel's Water Music!
670,3621,1,16,58,75,1.24,0.05315284776213995,608,It is surely a case of Divine Intervention!
677,3621,5,8,62,75,1.24,0.06531972647421809,608,We get it. Your mix tape is hot.
681,3621,1,16,58,75,1.24,0.05315284776213995,608,Can you play anything else besides The Heat is On?
701,3621,0,18,57,75,1.24,0.049647405419265024,608,do you think this will warm their souls as you play?
720,3621,3,12,60,75,1.24,0.059547845854790976,608,"No, I am sure I said make sure the music is of the ""radiating"" kind of beauty; not the radiator kind."
721,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,Hit it with a hammer if you need to wake them up.
722,3621,4,10,61,75,1.24,0.06250045044882722,608,"With the new tariff on metals making brass expensive, these pipes are just right. They even have a percussion feature."
522,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,I suppose that’s one way to radiate God’s love.
1719,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,First warm-up the congregation.
1731,3621,0,18,57,75,1.24,0.049647405419265024,608,"Yes, the tone is less than desirable, but on the other hand it does keep the cathedral warm."
1764,3621,1,16,58,75,1.24,0.05315284776213995,608,It's really radiating peace and warmth.
2781,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,The folks in apartment 6C are complaining to the super again.
2836,3621,1,16,58,75,1.24,0.05315284776213995,608,That will keep the pipes warm!
2843,3621,4,10,61,75,1.24,0.06250045044882722,608,I just wanted to blow off a little steam.
2973,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,Okay... I still think it looks like a radiator.
2979,3621,0,18,57,75,1.24,0.049647405419265024,608,it radiates warmth
2993,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,A couple of tabs with a hammer could get it going
2994,3621,3,12,60,75,1.24,0.059547845854790976,608,For this week's fire and brimstone sermon.
3008,3621,1,16,58,75,1.24,0.05315284776213995,608,"So, you're absolutely sure the parishioners want heavy metal?"
3036,3621,3,12,60,75,1.24,0.059547845854790976,608,"Steamy, yes. Presidential?, no."
3041,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,A few parishioners have complained about the banging being too loud.
3062,3621,3,12,60,75,1.24,0.059547845854790976,608,That's rad but how often do you have to bleed the pipes?
3089,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,"""The Heat Is On,"" please, by Glenn Frey."
3106,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,They radiate a beautiful sound.
3143,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,I think it's warmed up enough.
2775,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,Play A Hot Toccata
3173,3621,3,12,60,75,1.24,0.059547845854790976,608,I like it well enough—but there is the occasional clanging.
3181,3621,0,18,57,75,1.24,0.049647405419265024,608,"Well, I expect some warm tones from your new pipes."
3203,3621,3,12,60,75,1.24,0.059547845854790976,608,"Play the song that goes, ‘CLANG CLANG HISSSSSS!’."
3234,3621,1,16,58,75,1.24,0.05315284776213995,608,"It sounds terrible, but no one complains about the cold early morning services anymore"
3263,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,Steampunk ??
3342,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,Cool Jazz is not my forte.
3363,3621,3,12,60,75,1.24,0.059547845854790976,608,If you expect it to perform consistently you have to rap on the pipes every now and then with a pipe wrench.
3388,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,I'm trying to reduce the gurgle in the pipes.
3409,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,How about we just pray about it?
3417,3621,1,16,58,75,1.24,0.05315284776213995,608,How do we get rid of that banging?
3464,3621,3,12,60,75,1.24,0.059547845854790976,608,This has a lot more 'ping' to it.
3527,3621,1,16,58,75,1.24,0.05315284776213995,608,"So, this is where you come to let off steam?"
3530,3621,1,16,58,75,1.24,0.05315284776213995,608,I like to come and play and let off a little steam.
3533,3621,3,12,60,75,1.24,0.059547845854790976,608,"OK, it was cheap, but we can't use it in the summer."
3540,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,"Well, I guess that's one way to blow off some steam."
3178,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,It's a musical tribute to the holy sounds of New York City.
2750,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,It is safer than trying to light a fire under them!
2709,3621,3,12,60,75,1.24,0.059547845854790976,608,The sound can radiate the heavens
2678,3621,1,16,58,75,1.24,0.05315284776213995,608,"It isn't rising to Hosanna in the highest, but you're getting warmer."
1778,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,Hallelujah
1786,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,Either don't sing or close the windows...trees are dying out there.
1834,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,Play something that will warm our spirits.
1837,3621,0,18,57,75,1.24,0.049647405419265024,608,Please tell the congregation to cool it. I'm just warming up.
1852,3621,1,16,58,75,1.24,0.05315284776213995,608,"I'm sorry, but your music is a little too steamy for our congregation."
1874,3621,3,12,60,75,1.24,0.059547845854790976,608,This time play it with a little less dispersion
1882,3621,1,16,58,75,1.24,0.05315284776213995,608,It's an antique.
1893,3621,4,10,61,75,1.24,0.06250045044882722,608,'They say you play a hot piano...'
1899,3621,2,14,59,75,1.24,0.0564409920676948,608,I’m afraid you misunderstood. I said we wanted to go big and stream our Sunday services.
