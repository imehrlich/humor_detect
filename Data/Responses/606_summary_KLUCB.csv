3197,214,2,3,12,17,1.411764705882353,0.17275500183045192,606,Do we still get surge pricing if he doesn't use the app?
2855,214,1,5,11,17,1.411764705882353,0.14997116216449366,606,This always happens when we fly out of Denver.
2622,214,3,1,13,17,1.411764705882353,0.19286583895005885,606,I bet he was an editor in his previous life.
2523,214,1,5,11,17,1.411764705882353,0.14997116216449366,606,Looks like he ran out of sky miles.
4304,214,1,5,11,17,1.411764705882353,0.14997116216449366,606,Did your simulator training cover this?
3571,214,2,3,12,17,1.411764705882353,0.17275500183045192,606,I don't know...that bag looks over the size and weight limit to me.
4799,214,1,5,11,17,1.411764705882353,0.14997116216449366,606,I'm afraid the flight is overbooked.
5683,214,1,5,11,17,1.411764705882353,0.14997116216449366,606,Let's keep going. There will be plenty of other planes coming this way.

5621,214,1,5,11,17,1.411764705882353,0.14997116216449366,606,I'm getting really tired of giving these Google cloud engineers a ride home.
5552,214,2,3,12,17,1.411764705882353,0.17275500183045192,606,Ignore him. He’s high.
5519,214,2,3,12,17,1.411764705882353,0.17275500183045192,606,"Yeah, they warned me about flying over Colorado."
5291,214,1,5,11,17,1.411764705882353,0.14997116216449366,606,I guess Air Miles only get you so far.
5284,214,2,3,12,17,1.411764705882353,0.17275500183045192,606,I guess I really don't know clouds at all.
5163,214,3,1,13,17,1.411764705882353,0.19286583895005885,606,He should have taken the nonstop.

5566,214,1,5,11,17,1.411764705882353,0.14997116216449366,606,he might have more luck with an Uber Pool.

1241,214,2,3,12,17,1.411764705882353,0.17275500183045192,606,I guess Jim Morrison couldn’t break on through to the other side.
595,214,1,5,11,17,1.411764705882353,0.14997116216449366,606,I didn't realize we were that high.

114,214,2,3,12,17,1.411764705882353,0.17275500183045192,606,I think he's already flying high.

552,214,1,5,11,17,1.411764705882353,0.14997116216449366,606,So much for the D.B. Cooper mystery.
1246,214,2,3,12,17,1.411764705882353,0.17275500183045192,606,"No, that bag will never fit in the overhead bin."
56,214,2,3,12,17,1.411764705882353,0.17275500183045192,606,"He's high - so whatever you do, don't make eye contact."
1485,214,3,1,13,17,1.411764705882353,0.19286583895005885,606,Some passengers will do anything to avoid those TSA checks.
1338,214,1,5,11,17,1.411764705882353,0.14997116216449366,606,"Sorry sir, even the overhead compartment isn’t free these days."
2159,214,2,3,12,17,1.411764705882353,0.17275500183045192,606,We told him to stand on the LEFT side.
2122,214,2,3,12,17,1.411764705882353,0.17275500183045192,606,Are you Godot?
2101,214,3,1,13,17,1.411764705882353,0.19286583895005885,606,He thinks we're the Jefferson Airplane.

1544,214,2,3,12,17,1.411764705882353,0.17275500183045192,606,The guys running the simulator are easily bored.
1519,214,0,7,10,17,1.411764705882353,0.12303823919618757,606,"This simulator's a bit over the top, isn't it?"
1828,214,2,3,12,17,1.411764705882353,0.17275500183045192,606,"Sorry pal, we’re just going a couple more blocks."
4594,283,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,606,I see the new edition to hitch hikers guide to the galaxy has been released.
4576,283,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,606,Yet another kid falls for that backup to the cloud scam!
4292,283,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,606,Is there anything you can't do in the cloud these days?
4140,283,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,606,I think we’re high
4066,283,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,606,He just doesn’t appreciate the gravity of the situation.
3968,283,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,606,"Oh, my. He uploaded himself into the Cloud and now he wants a ride back to Earth."
3625,283,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,606,He has TSA Precheck.
3638,283,0,6,9,15,1.4,0.13093073414159545,606,I guess ‘Cloud 9’s not all you’d expect!
3484,283,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,606,Beats flying Basic Economy.
3434,283,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,606,"Man, is he high or what?"
3339,283,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,606,Slow down...slow...let him almost touch the door then jerk forward.
3292,283,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,606,Jesus.
4597,283,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,606,"Captain, flying over Colorado is certainly interesting!"
3132,283,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,606,Another Trump voter rejected by St. Peter.
3763,283,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,606,"Oh yeah, we’re over Colorado."
4714,283,3,0,12,15,1.4,0.2138089935299395,606,Even ride-sharing is up on the cloud these days.
5482,283,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,606,Looks like he’s high on something.
6356,283,3,0,12,15,1.4,0.2138089935299395,606,"This will be a better movie than ""Sully""!"
3058,283,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,606,Keep going. He might be carrying liquids.
6338,283,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,606,I'll never get that song outta my head for the rest of the day!
6310,283,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,606,Avoid eye contact and lock the doors.
6261,283,0,6,9,15,1.4,0.13093073414159545,606,"Look, he thinks we're doing a good job."
6106,283,0,6,9,15,1.4,0.13093073414159545,606,Move over George. I bet he's got pot.
5851,283,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,606,Cloud commuting!
4763,283,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,606,Keep driving; he looks high as a kite.
5739,283,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,606,Definitely too big for a personal item.
5645,283,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,606,Oh great! ...you made eye contact.
5377,283,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,606,You know what? We should really look into becoming Uber pilots.
5036,283,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,606,Didn't we see him on our outbound flight?
5018,283,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,606,Thinks he's on cloud nine.
5007,283,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,606,"But, I can't tell if he from one of those shit hole countries or not."
4942,283,2,0,8,10,1.4,0.26666666666666666,606,Don't even think about it. He lost his security clearance.
5680,283,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,606,Cloud 9 ain’t what it used to be.
3002,283,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,606,"normally I would , but we're non stop"
776,283,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,606,Whoa....are you seeing this?! A green shirt with those pants?
2888,283,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,606,"Keep going, I'm sure he's high."
2990,283,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,606,Hot dang! That's DB Cooper!
38,283,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,606,He's still going to have to pay the full fare.
174,283,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,606,"I don't know, Ned... I don't think that bag will fit in the overhead compartments."
215,283,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,606,This wasn't part of the flight simulator.
297,283,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,606,Don't pick him up. The last one got stuck in the engine.
333,283,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,606,Better report a Cloud 9er.
370,283,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,606,Only if pitches in for gas.
403,283,0,6,9,15,1.4,0.13093073414159545,606,"Damn... am I high, or is he?"
465,283,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,606,Has the airline added a fee for that yet?
502,283,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,606,Now it looks like United should rethink the way it handles passengers with too much carry-on.
533,283,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,606,"Right after recreational marijuana was legalized, the software updates for this flight simulator got weirder and weirder ."
555,283,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,606,Is that a Trump sign?
647,283,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,606,He’s taking “Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” both too literally and yet not quite far enough.
760,283,3,0,12,15,1.4,0.2138089935299395,606,I'd stop if he had a dog.
819,283,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,606,"the weather man did say "" high, today, in the sixties, right ?"""

1220,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,Quick! Pretend we don't see him.
1293,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,I think he's telling us to bring the nose up.
848,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,Only if he has gas money.
1326,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,Wow! He must be really high!
1389,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,Do you mind checking the altimeter one more time?
1401,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,The air traffic controllers in Key West are sure a different breed.
1409,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,"For the last time, we can't pull over!"
1419,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,You can't trust these types- they're always a little high.
1427,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,Just keep looking straight ahead.
1448,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,"Wow, cloud computing really overpromised."
1491,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,I see our airline got a new angel investor
1545,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,"Ass, gas, or grass?"
1566,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,Thrust me when I say he doesn't need a lift.
1569,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,Uber really is going too far.
1577,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,I do hope someone picks him up before it rains.
1603,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,Say Alf... do you think drugs are getting stronger?
1363,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,"I know we can't stop, but I still feel a little guilty."
836,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,"Don't pick up hitchhikers, Captain. Especially when they're high."
806,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,"Sorry, we're fully booked."
786,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,"Well, that's one way to avoid a TSA pat down."
3253,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,Keep going. Probably high.
58,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,The plane in front of us must be an American Airlines.
90,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,Looks like United overbooked again.
145,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,Nobody's picked him up since we dropped him off here last week.
158,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,Don't pick him up. He looks high.
169,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,"Sir, how come you have never given me a compliment on my flying?"
171,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,Looks like another cloud nine return trip.
175,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,"I dunno, he must be on standby."
218,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,"Before deregulation, we could have picked him up."
224,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,Let's check our coordinates . . . I think one of us is lost.
268,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,I picked a bad day to fly sober.
287,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,Going to LA?
348,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,Better not. He looks high.
360,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,"We can't , there's no place to pull over."
412,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,I heard you dragged someone off earlier. Can I take his seat?
422,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,It's our newest economy class.
446,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,I told you not to get so high.
478,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,What say we don't include this in the flight-log?
485,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,Better check those vegan brownies.
532,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,These regional carriers treat their pilots like dirt!
573,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,Forecast says a beautiful day. Not a cloud in the sky. And you’re just gonna leave him there?
587,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,"Well, he would have to remove his belt and light coat first."
589,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,You'd think United would have landed before removing him...
733,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,Good thing he only has a carry-on.
746,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,Don't stop. He's obviously high.
748,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,This is weird but have you heard about the hitchhikers the folks at NASA pick up?
772,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,"Elderly hippie standing in whipped cream on runway, 10-4."
1614,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,Forget it. The last one we rescued complained about the airline food.
1728,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,probably a terrorist
34,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,You'd think a cloud computing tech would be paid more than that.
1743,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,I thought United changed their passenger removal policy.
2546,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,Looks like millennials have taken Jack Kerouac to the cloud.
2602,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,Looks like we found D.B. Cooper.
3169,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,"Yeah, I see him. Happens every time we’re over Woodstock"
2630,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,Looks like Jack Kerouac needs a lift again.
2639,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,"Gas, Grass, or Ass, buddy. Nobody rides for free!"
2660,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,Burning Man is so tight.
2670,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,I picked the wrong week to stop drinking.
2700,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,"Okay, give him a ride, but my Mother can never know about this."
2713,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,Guess he ain't on cloud 9.
2731,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,"Caption, do you think he might know where we are?"
2735,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,"I'd stop, but that bag will never fit under the seat in front of him"
2771,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,Don't stop. That thumb isn't in a full upright and locked position.
2540,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,Is that Neil Young?
2790,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,"If it’s D. B. Cooper, tell him the fare has risen."
2819,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,"And folks, off to your left, you'll see the inspiration for a classic 1960's Rolling Stones hit."
2852,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,We've got a schedule to keep. He can catch the next one.
2854,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,He probably wants a ride to the SkyMall.
2867,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,"Someone should tell this guy, 'Only prayers get you out of Purgatory"". He'll be out there all day"
2949,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,They stopped giving angels wings after the 2008 housing crisis.
2982,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,"Whatever you do, don't make eye contact."
2996,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,"I hate to stereotype people, but I wouldn’t pick that guy up on the jersey turnpike."
3010,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,The lunacy of that guy is beyond terminal.
3072,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,"Just pull over, Phil. We never make our arrival times anyways."
3073,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,"Can you check our altitude again, Steve?"
3091,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,"O.K., one of us is really high!"
1735,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,"Our oxygen levels are improving, Johnson. My hallucinations are up to the 1970s."
2792,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,"Look, another United passenger."
2537,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,Some folks will do anything to avoid the baggage check fee.
2577,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,Layovers are not what they used to be.
2503,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,We’re not going where he’s going
1794,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,I hope he knows to duck for the wing!
1815,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,I'm sure it's just a weathered buffoon.
1827,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,What would Jesus do?
1832,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,Douglas Adams again...what part of 'we can't fly that far' does he not understand?
1867,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,He must think we're taxiing.
1875,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,Always the most awkward part of this route.
1883,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,Whoa! I would really like to try whatever he is on!
1891,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,We've seen a lot of this since they legalized pot in California.
1906,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,You think that's a wig?

2529,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,"Captain, wasn't this the guy on the mountaintop café in a previous cartonn?"
1967,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,"Yeah, he's a beta tester who went cloud"
1991,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,The way people dress these days! No wonder he was bumped from PearlyGatesExpress!
2014,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,We can only pick him up if he's been TSA prechecked.
1936,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,You would think he'd be fine hanging out on cloud 9.
2049,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,He's probably been waiting an eternity for someone to pick him up.
2058,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,Hey Frank....how's that for a cloud-based platform?
2089,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,"Sorry! We're going down, you'll have to catch the next flight to go up."
2110,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,We can only stop on cloud nine.
2190,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,That must be the new super economy class.
2272,629,1,1,9,11,1.2727272727272727,0.1949782780866111,606,"Hey Mitch, there's another one of those Cloud Entry TSA Pre-Check."
2293,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,Wow. He used to fly Pence around. I thought he got a job in White House.
2321,629,0,3,8,11,1.2727272727272727,0.14083575804390613,606,"Ignore him, I can tell he's high."

626,887,1,0,8,9,1.2222222222222223,0.2222222222222222,606,I don't pick up hitchhikers. Especially if they are high.
580,887,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,606,I guess we should check the rules manual and see if it’s covered?

2915,887,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,606,Don't stop for him. I gave him a lift once and he wouldn't stop talking.
2912,887,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,606,"Well his thumb is in the right place, because he's going to get the wing without the prayer."
2883,887,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,606,That's why we're not allowed to eat the same meal Captain.

2828,887,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,606,He was really never able to handle the idea that he had failed to Make America Great Again.....
2820,887,1,0,8,9,1.2222222222222223,0.2222222222222222,606,"Okay, but he'll have to check the bag."
2977,887,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,606,It just wouldn't be fair to everyone who had to wait in line.
2818,887,1,0,8,9,1.2222222222222223,0.2222222222222222,606,"If he's up here, he's probably not on the No Fly List."

2762,887,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,606,We’re gonna pick him up alright. He’s about to be our wingman.
2761,887,1,0,8,9,1.2222222222222223,0.2222222222222222,606,I don't know. I picked up one of those guys once and he stank to high heaven.
2760,887,1,0,8,9,1.2222222222222223,0.2222222222222222,606,No Way!! I heard Johnson picked one up last year and now they have him flying out of Newark
2751,887,1,0,8,9,1.2222222222222223,0.2222222222222222,606,They're putting everything in the cloud these days.

2730,887,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,606,Flying standby is not what it used to be.

3018,887,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,606,"If he can make it all the way up here, I don't know why he needs to hitchhike."
3027,887,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,606,It seems even hitchhiking is in the cloud now

3243,887,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,606,Ok but this time you need to tell him we only have middle seats BEFORE he gets in the plane.
3311,887,1,0,8,9,1.2222222222222223,0.2222222222222222,606,"Don't pick him up, he's obviously high."
3237,887,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,606,"Pilot: It's DB Cooper on a cloud. He's thumbs up looking like a hitchhiker Ground Control: You found him! Well as long as he's not hijacking, pick him up."
3227,887,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,606,It's the guy from the Twilight Zone.

3163,887,1,0,8,9,1.2222222222222223,0.2222222222222222,606,But what if he has over three fluid ounces of liquids?
3155,887,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,606,The plane ahead of us is super economy.

3148,887,1,0,8,9,1.2222222222222223,0.2222222222222222,606,He's lucky. There's an empty plane right behind us!
3144,887,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,606,"It's always that same guy, same cloud."

3076,887,1,0,8,9,1.2222222222222223,0.2222222222222222,606,"Well, since the aircraft is stopped in midair, why not pick him up. Maybe he knows how to get us going again."
3062,887,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,606,"No, TSA says we can't,"
3055,887,1,0,8,9,1.2222222222222223,0.2222222222222222,606,"Yeh, ol' DB Copper will be waiting a long time before we pick him up again."
3029,887,1,0,8,9,1.2222222222222223,0.2222222222222222,606,There used to be a lot more.
2624,887,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,606,Some folks will do anything to avoid security.
2614,887,1,0,8,9,1.2222222222222223,0.2222222222222222,606,Looks like he's not free fallin' anymore.
2698,887,1,0,8,9,1.2222222222222223,0.2222222222222222,606,"I was right - Air Traffic Control DID say Airway 51, not Area 51."

2610,887,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,606,We'd have to put him in first class. There are no seats left in the back.

2491,887,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,606,EasyJet customers should really start reading the fine print when booking a non-direct flight.
2438,887,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,606,You're telling me Jagger was talking about a real guy?
2294,887,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,606,Only if he has Global Entry.
2454,887,1,0,8,9,1.2222222222222223,0.2222222222222222,606,Wasn’t he there yesterday?
2318,887,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,606,It's just another one who thought there's a stairway FROM heaven.
2327,887,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,606,The FAA should put regulations on air-hikers.
2311,887,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,606,Do you think he's headed up or down?
2368,887,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,606,have you been reading Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy again?!
2400,887,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,606,"Wow, is this dude high"
2410,887,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,606,Don't stop. Clearly he's high.
2437,887,1,0,8,9,1.2222222222222223,0.2222222222222222,606,Zoloft is wonderful stuff.
2364,887,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,606,Maybe he confused hijacking with hitchhiking.
3674,1307,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,606,We’d have to gate check that pack.
6368,1307,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,606,"""Wasn't he in the exit row on yesterday's flight/'"
5480,1307,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,606,It looks like an Uber driver took him to the wrong place.
5303,1307,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,606,"Don't look left, just keep going!"
4648,1307,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,606,"Don't Captain, he hasn't been screened by TSA."
4543,1307,1,0,9,10,1.2,0.19999999999999998,606,Don’t stop. This guy looks shady.
4291,1307,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,606,Damn! I think that's D. B. Cooper!
4017,1307,1,0,9,10,1.2,0.19999999999999998,606,I wouldn't stop for him.
3128,1307,1,0,9,10,1.2,0.19999999999999998,606,Where can I find what he's smoking?
392,1307,1,0,9,10,1.2,0.19999999999999998,606,Get ready for cloud commuting!
2772,1307,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,606,Didn't we bump him this morning?
347,1307,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,606,"SLC Tower, this is American 1542. We may have found D. B. Cooper."
1685,1307,1,0,9,10,1.2,0.19999999999999998,606,These standby passengers just don’t give up.
2044,1307,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,606,Apple sent me to the cloud. I need to get back.
3087,1307,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,606,We can take you as far as LaGuardia.
2308,1307,1,0,9,10,1.2,0.19999999999999998,606,"Boy, his arm must be tired"
2559,1307,1,0,9,10,1.2,0.19999999999999998,606,We actually are about eight miles high
2074,1307,1,0,9,10,1.2,0.19999999999999998,606,Normally I would say yes...but something about him seems a bit shady.
4468,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Does he need a ride or he is just happy to see us?
4535,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"It's been like this ever since ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."""
4476,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Do you know how dangerous it is to pick up hitchhikers, sir?"
4477,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,What does he think this is? The plane to heaven?
4486,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,It's Roger Ebert and he likes us!
4514,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Well, the weather did say to expect strong updrafts."
4528,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,That's the third one this week!
4533,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Don't even consider it, Sully."
4544,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He looks 'NRA.' Keep going.
4557,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,But can we waive the baggage fee?
4551,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Don't stop. Looks Army. They are never alone!
4556,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,It's opposite day.
4462,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,That's the same guy Ed! Do you still think I'm paranoid?
4570,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Who's tripping?
4575,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Don't pick him up. He's probably a terrorist!
4589,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Ladies and gentleman, we remind you that this is a non-hitching flight."
4591,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Don't stop. He probably has bird flu.
4605,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I guess the Woodstock Nation couldn't live forever!
4548,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I told him he'd be happier on Cloud 8!
4448,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Cloud commuting! What'll they think of next?
4901,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Just ignore him; he does it all the time to avoid to pay the fare!
4436,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Thank GAWD we left the Paris agreement. This pollution cloud just SAVED MY LIFE!
4305,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Let's keep going, maybe he won't notice us."
4313,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Roger tower. Left at vagrant in snow pile and taxi to runway two-six...
4319,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,What the hell kind of mushroom was in that beef stroganoff?
4323,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Well, thank goodness he's not in a lawn chair. No one would believe us."
4337,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Never mind. That backpack is too big to carry on anyway.
4347,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Titanium status has its perks
4354,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,We must have died and gone to heaven. I've always wanted to be an airline pilot.
4361,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Not until he goes through TSA.
4363,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Lets pick him up, maybe he can tell us where we are going."
4443,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"If we pick him up, he'll never earn that other wing."
4367,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Just throw him some packs of those tiny pretzels or something
4376,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Will work as flight assistant for free ride.
4378,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Could you give me a lift? My uber car cancelled.
4384,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,We're now helping to retrieve cloud data storage?
4403,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Can I hitch a ride to Cloud Nine.
4410,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Open the door, I'll get out the security terminal."
4426,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Hey what’s that guy doing in the Hudson?
4430,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I guess cloud 9 isn't for everyone.
4618,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Even if he promised not to play, we still can't brake in mid-air."
4432,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Wow, I saw him standing their on the way in. I think it's a scam and he just wants a handout. He knows no one can give him a ride up here."
4368,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I don't know... He looks like a hippie and he's definitely high.
4627,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"My take, the dude wants to go to Heaven, shall we?!"
4647,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Don’t worry, Sir, that’s just one of those outcasted journalists, trying to hitch a ride to heaven."
4640,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"I'd stop, but I don't think his carry on would fit in the overhead compartment."
4780,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Isn't that the guy we dragged out of Economy?
4797,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Now boarding zone 32.
4801,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I'd pick him up if he wasn't high.
4816,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I think we're lost--maybe we can ask him if he has a guide to the galaxy.
4822,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I always suspected cloud 9 would suck
4823,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,We're not picking him up. He's definitely high.
4824,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Why not? He's travelling light.
4834,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,They demand an aisle seat.
4836,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Looks like he is high.
4837,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Douglas Adams is going to find his own damn way to his next stop.
4847,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,It's Douglas Adams! He wrote the Hitchhiker's Guile to the Galaxy. Let's go back an pick him up.
4848,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,That guy is way high.
4849,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Okay, then. So who is Jerry Garcia?"
4857,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"No, the last time I stopped to pick him up, we lost altitude."
4865,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Sorry, Purgatory is as close as we get."
4872,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He's not as bad as the squeegee guys.
4876,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"As long as he's not checking any bags, I'm ok with it"
4887,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Questions? Oh yes, I have lots of questions?"
4269,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Man! There's a desperate dude. He must know we don't go there.
4778,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Personally, I like the new air traffic controller concept."
4636,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Go ahead, but I'll have to bump the passenger in 34F."
4775,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"He looks okay, but you never know about drifters."
4766,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Don’t pick him up
4642,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I don't trust anything uploaded to the cloud.
4650,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Wow, even cloud storage has its limits."
4654,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Another one from the Pearly Gates Basic plan.
4658,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Thumbs up...now, that's what I'm talkin' about!"
4661,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Wow, the sky really is the limit!"
4673,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Have you read ""Hitchhiker's Guide.."""
4675,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Sorry buddy, this is a nonstop flight."
4692,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,So God does have a sense of humor.
4702,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Back in the day, we could pick them up without worrying about getting hijacked."
4709,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I'm afraid if we don't pick him he'll give us a bad Uber rating.
4892,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,This new airline auditing system is a crock.
4716,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I wouldn't pick up this guy. He looks really high.
4723,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,The ascent to heaven is a little more difficult than I thought.
4727,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,That guy's got his head in the clouds if he thinks we're gonna pull over.
4739,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,And you two said I would never get my wings!
4745,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Pick him up! He can pay half the gas!
4756,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I've seen this more and more over Colorado since they legalized marijuana.
4759,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Isn't he the same guy on the ground who always needed ""jut seven dollars"" to get to Oxnard..??"
4765,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"I dunno, Ted. He could just be trying to take us for peanuts, pretzels, or a cookie."
4767,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Yesterday I saw him trying to enter the Pearly Gates.
4268,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,We could forcefully drag someone off to make room.
3699,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"""It's Elon Musk, his Tesla will pick him up""."
4260,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Another billionaire in search of authenticity.
3667,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Sure, pull over and pick this guy up. He's gonna have to pay the $25 baggage fee for that back pack though."
3668,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Pass him by. The guy a few clouds down has a cute pup with him.
3670,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"OK by me, as long as he chips in for gas."
3671,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,It's another baby boomer - they even try to get a free ride in the afterlife.
3675,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He'll have to wing it.
3681,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Let's give him a ride; he played with the Jefferson Airplane.
3690,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Sorry -- bag's too big for carry-on.
3691,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He wants to return to the Planet of the Apes
3692,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,My Uber app says that's him.
3704,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,he must be high on life
3713,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Doesn't he know this is a nonstop flight?
3717,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Look Paul, another sucker got lost trying to find Cloud Nine"
3732,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Maybe heaven isn't all it's cracked up to be.
3737,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,We've noticed an increase since the recreational marijuana laws passed.
3740,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Yo. Pick me up and we can exchange stories about flying high.
3764,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I'm pretty sure that guy is high.
3769,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,So the Stones ment it literally.
3770,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Oh look, it's the new Hoboeing 24/7."
3774,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I know where that is. Just hang an up at the next corner
3659,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Dip the port wing or we’ll have hitchhiker all through the engine.
3778,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Why leave Cloud 9 ?
3626,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"You'd think he'd have learned not to hitchhike anymore after having been raped, murdered and dumped at the side of the road."
3619,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Really bad layover.
4903,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"So this guy named Santa, takes Trump’s advice, and the next thing you know..."
3451,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,No boarding pass and overhead compartments are full.
3453,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Looks like Arlo’s just retrieved some data.
3462,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"I'd stop, but there's no place to pull over..."
3485,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,It's a shame that we don't fly to San Jose.
3488,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Rule #1. Never pick up a hitchhiker.
3489,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,We’re seeing a lot more of these guys since recreational marijuana became legal.
3495,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He took early retirement so he could travel.
3509,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"I've heard of flying standby, but not standing flyby."
3517,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Looks like the end of the line for the Stairway to Heaven.
3524,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Only if he helps pay for gas.
3539,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Okay, it’s your call but I have to remind you of Delta’s official policy: “Gas, grass or ass. No one rides for free.”"
3544,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,We just don't have room in the overhead bins for that carryon.
3557,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I couldn’t afford the surge.
3558,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,So much for TSA approved.
3585,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I hate the Cloud Nine route!
3594,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Wow! It’s been a while since I’ve seen one of those!
3597,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Probably an old hippie, everyone else gave up hitch hiking in the late '70s."
3616,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Just left the Trump Administration. Need a ride back to sanity.
3622,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,It’s him again.
3814,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I see our new standby policy is in effect.
3819,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Folks, we've reached cruising altitude. And if you look out to your left, you'll see my deadbeat brother still relying on me for everything."
3840,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Just act like you don't see him. Maybe he'll fly away.
4045,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I promised my Mom that I'd never pick up hitchhikers.
4046,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,No. That backpack wouldn't fit in an overhead compartment.
4052,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"And yet somehow, thought the pilots, a hitchhiker on a cloud was less alarming than Trump's latest tweetstorm."
4087,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He’s taking up up and away to a whole new level.
4093,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Timothy Leary or not, I wouldn’t pick him up."
4095,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,If he REALLY wanted to impress me he'd show some gas money.
4097,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Don't stop. The last time I picked him up he complained about the cramped leg room and no space left in the overhead to stow his bag.
4098,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I guess that's where the stairway to heaven ends...
4102,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Isn't that the same guy that jumped out over Utah last week?
4109,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Sir, I believe we've entered Oregon airspace."
4115,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Someone is pretty high.
4132,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Can’t pick him up. His bag’s too big for carry on.
4149,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I have a feeling that Uber is only available somewhere else
4170,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Check altitude.
4188,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,What’s the company policy on hitchhikers?
4197,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"I don't know what we should do, this situation never came up in the flight simulator."
4226,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He probably changed his mind about staying with the car.
4255,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Him? That's D.B. Cooper. He's still looking for a way down.
4256,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He's just after our inflight beverage service! Tomorrow he'll be back on the same cloud!
4020,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,It's a lifestyle choice. He could could have stayed on board.
4012,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Now that I understand. It's cloud computing that I can't begin to fathom.
4002,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"I'm on cloud 9, man"
3992,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Looks like he got caught up in that funky shit goin' down in the city after all."" ""Well, it's there that he has to stay."
3844,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Fine. Just tell him to keep his tray table up.
3848,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Probably the last Delta employee leaving Atlanta.
3855,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Oh, did you hear--they started bumping passengers mid-flight."
3863,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"I don,t think the oxygen gauges are working."
3880,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Mirages just aren't as good as they used to be.
3909,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,See how high he's going.
3913,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,This ride sharing thing is getting out of hand.
3915,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Pity, another poor fella stuck on cloud nine!"
3917,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I'd stop but I'm afraid the jets would suck him in
4263,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Great, three more hours of you humming Get Off Of My Cloud."
3919,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Please don’t stop this time, Fred."
3945,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I think it’s Led Zeppelin trying to catch a ride on the stairway to heaven.
3952,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Another frequent flier who ran out of miles...
3962,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,At least he's not thumbs down.
3964,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Do you think he's going up, or down?"
3972,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Looks like he only had enough mileage for half a flight.
3975,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I tried to tell him no-one goes to Cloud 9 any more.
3977,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Now that’s what I call ‘standby.’
3980,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"I dig his wandering spirit, but I'm just not sure what the TSA policy is on hitching these days."
3985,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"New York Center, 784 with you at Angels 43."
3937,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Man, is he high or what?"
4914,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,And those seated on the left side of the aircraft will notice the free loader on Cloud 9.
5864,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,No point in stopping. We're not getting any higher.
4925,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,My daughter works at Google. She told me it can be dangerous to put all your trust in the cloud.
5940,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Doesn't he realize he's already there?
5945,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Rodger. Prepare to pull over. The '60s just called. They want him back.
5949,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Bank and flare the flaps like we’re going to pick him up.
5951,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I guess the plane to Woodstock's late.
5962,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,United flight was overbooked.
5980,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Let’s ask if he wants the credit card with free miles.
5985,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,One of us is definitely too high right now.
5986,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"As I suspected, Captain, we're over Colorado."
5999,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I heard St. Peter turned him away.
6004,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Steer clear of that guy. He doesn’t shut up.
6006,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Don’t even think about being nice guys or TSA will have our heads...
6013,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Well, there's nothing in the regulations about NOT picking up hitchhikers."
6022,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,You ask him if he's enrolled in TSA Pre-Check.
6024,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"If we pick up one, we'll have to pick up all of them."
6028,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Guess he ditched the Tesla.
6033,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He realized too late that the Cloud is a metaphor.
6036,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,SAD...guess he just got used to travel on the dole. Yeah and that hair...you knew that was FAKE NEWS!
6039,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,No can do; he probably doesn't have the 25 bucks for the carry-on.
6040,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Did you say VFR or VR?
5917,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Apparently Spirit Airlines has introduced a new fare class.
6044,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,That must be the Cloud Tech guy they just hired.
5914,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I heard he started the Mile High Club.
5904,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"He looks okay, let’s pull over."
5710,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Standby passengers will try anything these days.

5725,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,'Looks like my wife just backed up our son to the cloud.'
5740,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Are you heading up or down?
5745,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Can we do that thing where we slow down and look like we are going to give him a ride, and then accelerate away when he tries to get in?"
5773,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Apparently, Heaven's not all it's cracked up to be."
5785,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Should we feel skepticism that he's not on the beam?
5797,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Does he know ""Sully"" retired?"
5801,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Quick! Swerve like you’re going to hit him.
5803,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Is That Hugh Hefner? Hey, Hugh get off my cloud"
5808,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He probably wants to go to cloud ten
5811,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Hey, isn't that your brother Richard?"
5816,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He got busted for smoking weed.
5838,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Stop! Isn't that Charlie? I went to flight to flight school with him.
5841,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Could you give me a lift to the Big Air competition?
5846,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,'Is this the way to the galaxy?'
5848,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,The new Redbull formula has really gone too far...
5852,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Another methane addict - I wouldn’t. They can be quite volatile.
5893,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Don't, he never chips in for gas."
5906,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Well, Sully, we know you can do an emergency landing -- how about an emergency pick-up?"
5705,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He's obviously higher than a kite.
6058,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,maybe heaven isn't what it is cracked up to be.
6087,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Sorry buddy, but we're headed for Kennedy."
6260,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I guess the economy is worse than I thought.
6269,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Too bad he’s not going our way!
6275,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Sir, that is a human drone. It is delivering packages for Amazon."
6279,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I think he appreciates our proper use of signals.
6293,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Captain, this has been a long strange trip--I'm seeing floaters."
6296,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He's probably under fifty pounds.
6302,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Didn't we drop that stop?
6323,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Is “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” still in print?
6325,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Should we stop?"" ""No he could be dangerous."
6327,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,That is the weirdest thing I've ever seen God do.
6328,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Irv, your dead head needs a ride."
6337,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,It says cloudy with a chance of Wayne.
6339,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Hey bro's. Could you give me a lift to the Jimmy Hendrix concert?
6357,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Can't he see we're going the other way?
6364,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Not asking for a ride - he just liked us.
6367,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Looks like we're going the right way.
6383,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Can you give me a lift to Cloud 9?
6390,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"C'mon, let's give him a lift - we have some to spare."
3445,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,There goes the neighborhood.
6252,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Hitchhiker's Guide to the Globe
6080,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Don't stop; there's something creepy about him.
6249,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He'll get his lift when the wing gets there.
6225,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,We must be approaching Colorado.
6095,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"If he thinks we're going to pick him up with a full flight, he's got his feet in the clouds."
6100,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Roger that. All clear for the Hudson.
6108,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Wow, they are still dragging people off of flights."
6116,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He looks as high as a kite
6118,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He obviously rose to the top of the standby list
6120,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Check the flight plan, Clarence...I'm pretty sure this is nonstop service."
6122,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,We are approaching Cloud Cuckoo Land.
6152,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,All I've been hearing lately is that I need to get with the times and move to the cloud but turns out I'm the only one up here!
6153,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Poor guy, I heard the big man is going through a hip-hop phase."
6157,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Jeff put hash oil in the simulator again.
6164,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I heard the big guy is going through a hip-hop phase.
6184,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Lifting his spirits may just give his spirit the optimal lift to cross over.
6185,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Next stop, cloud 9. Please mind the gap."
6191,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,So I see even hitchhiking has moved to the cloud.
6203,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Oh no, do you think Trump has exploded the world?"
6207,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,At least someone thinks I'm doing a good job.
6208,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Do you think we should check with TSA?
6211,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I guess Cloud 9 isn't quite what it used to be.
6223,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Let's log it as an Unexpected Floating Object.
6235,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,That is quite a high!
5701,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He's going up not down.
5697,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Isn't Woodstock the other way?
5691,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Don't stop, he hasn't been through TSA"
5153,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Isn't that the guy who wrote HITCHHIKERS GUIDE TO THE GALAXY?
5160,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I think 14F's open.
5164,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I've heard of no-frills airlines but this is ridiculous.
5172,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Sorry, this is a non-stop flight."
5181,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He’s going to want my second stroopwafel. Don’t stop.
5184,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Tell him we're overbooked but there's another plane just behind this one.
5203,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Not with that haircut.
5212,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Poor guy. Another one who didn't read the fine print on the Apple update.
5213,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Poor guy. Got the cloud, but not the wings."
5219,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Well, under the new FAA ""deregulation"", we can pick up hitchhikers, and the airline is looking for more revenue. The problem might be the carry-on bag."
5229,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Uhhh Houston .... We have a problem!
5230,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,We'd have to drop him off in Amsterdam.
5231,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I didn't realize iCloud archives went as far back as the '60's.
5236,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Well that's not the finger most passengers use.
5250,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"When he said he wanted to get high, we didn’t think he meant 30,000 feet."
5251,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Cloud Nine's not one of our stops. It's not the first time and somebody ought to tell him. Sad.
5257,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"There, I told you Gary - same spot every week."
5295,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,You mean all that comb-over blond hair was a wig after all?
5316,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,If he is going to heaven or hell he must go through Atlanta.
5150,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He’s high. Ignore him.
5321,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,We will have to watch out flying over Colorado.
5147,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I changed my mind. I don't need the NRA discount.
5133,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,But captain...How will we gate check his bag?
4968,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I did’nt think they allowed any hitchhikers on the highway to heaven
4971,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Surprised he can even hold out his thumb, as high as he is."
4977,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,What's he up to?
4984,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,With fares soaring we’re going to see more of these.
4991,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,It's Douglas Adams.
4996,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Tell him we only have a middle seat available.
4998,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I've always wondered which cloud was No. 9.
5020,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,DID THE TESLA BREAK DOWN ?
5034,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Have you noticed how clouds can resemble people?
5044,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Another fallen angel.
5056,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I heard St. Peter is casting out Trump voters right and left.
5059,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,We picked the wrong day to stop drinking!
5060,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I never knew there was an app for hitch hiking in the cloud.
5096,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Don't stop Captain! He's higher than a kite.
5100,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,This sky looks like he needs a ride.
5105,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I’ m a little high. Can I hitch a ride?
5113,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Wait...should he be worried or should we?
5118,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,U F Off!
5125,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Looks like he is high.
5140,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,You get used to it. There's one around every cloud anymore
5326,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Oh. So that's what 'the cloud' is all about.
5327,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Don't stop. We're an express flight.
5338,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Isn't that Cloud 9? Why would he need a lift?
5546,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Not quite, captain. Altimeter says we're only seven miles high."
5554,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Didn't we drop him off yesterday?
5557,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,The last time I stopped for him was a disaster.
5564,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,We see them frequently. That hitchiker’s guide has some real errors.
5577,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Call for Mr. Jagger...we've spotted another interloper.
5578,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Don't pick him up he burned Uber.
5591,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Air traffic control says he's headed back to the 70s.
5606,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,That guy is obviously high.
5607,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,...fuck him...just another Catholic who’s lost his way up from purgatory...
5625,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Tell him sorry, it's a direct flight."
5627,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He should have read 'iCloud for Dummies'!
5629,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,This new marijuana must be great. In my day you could never get this high.
5633,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,You don’t see a lot of can’t-be-cirrus clouds below eighteen thousand feet!
5642,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Remember when he only flew on Air Force One?
5651,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I thought they did away with Cloud 9 rules
5652,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I heard he's trying to write a sequel to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
5665,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"If that's God, are we going his way?"
5667,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Something tells me we're not going to Cleveland.
5684,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I told you not to encourage him at the Admirals Club. Marakesh is so not on the way.
5536,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I guess heaven can wait
5532,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Just toss him some peanuts.
5506,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Captain, I recommend we do not report this."
5499,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"No, not going back down there. Do you have any alternative destinations?"
5341,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"- giimme a break, dudes -am I chopped liver or what...?"
5344,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He must have used the Cloud when he purchased his ticket.
5349,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I guess he’s tired of Cloud 9.
5352,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I never stop for those Cloud 9 guys.
5368,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I thought they had a guide to the galaxy and this guy is stuck on cloud 8.
5372,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,The only empty seat is in first class.
5375,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Guess that musician stood in the middle of the Highway To Heaven....
5380,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I don't think we could stop for him even if we wanted to.
5394,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Don't stop! I don't like the looks of that backpack
4915,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Hey, Joe, we can't pick him up, besides breaking the law of gravity, he must be so full of hot air, he'll have us asleep before we land."
5398,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I guess Heaven was not what he expected.
5417,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,What? You think I hiked all the way up here for the view!?
5434,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Looks like someone lost his Guide to the Galaxy.
5450,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,That guy's only ride is on a wing and a prayer!
5452,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Must've clapped after take-off.
5453,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Have you heard about the new stand-by policy?
5463,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Tell him it’s a full flight.
5467,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Uh, U.H.O. off the port side."
5488,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Looks like business on Cloud 9 is picking up.
5498,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Just don't make eye contact and maybe he won't notice us.
5400,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Don't stop. I make it a rule to never pick up strangers.
3428,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I saw that movie. Pretty good.
2352,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Tell him there will be extra charge for the backpack.
3413,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I bet Sully would've picked him up.
1197,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,To SpaceX
1206,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,What do you mean you’ve never read “ Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Universe”?
1208,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He needs to get one of those cardboard signs.
1209,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,What do you think: is he trying to hitch a ride or giving us a thumbs up?
1212,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Traffic in sight. It looks as if he just came up inside a cyclone!
1213,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Are you sure that LSD button indicates Large Screen Display?
1214,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He's out there every trip.
1216,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"1. Hey Sully, with the river so close, we really don't have time to pick up any more hitchhikers ..."
1229,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Captain, a hitchhiker on cloud 9."
1232,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"No, I'm not pulling over. I really don't think he's going anywhere. Anyone who can stand on a cloud is just showing off."
1234,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Looks like one of the Clinton campaign volunteers trying to hitch a ride back to reality.
1235,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,“ I’ve seen that before. It’s a vertibratus cirrus”.
1245,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Man, people will do anything to avoid airport security checks!"
1247,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Keep driving, he looks like he's on cloud nine."
1253,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Another digital nomad taking up space on the cloud.
1271,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Captain, we can’t give him a seat unless he cleared security."
1275,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,We're headed to Orange County. They'll just send him back.
1308,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Oh my God, we’re on the highway to heaven."
1317,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"If I were on Cloud 9, I wouldn't want to leave, would you?"
1190,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,You're right Captain. Air sickness pills can have a strange effect on the imagination. At least I stopped throwing up.
1323,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Well, I DON'T think he looks like a terrorist, and I'm picking him up."
1174,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I hear that more and more folks work in the cloud these days.
1141,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,...are you sure Captain? I really think we should give him a lift
878,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I finally got used to trusting the cloud but I really think that could be a bum steer.
890,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Since the economic downturn, passengers have found it increasingly difficult to fly standby."
897,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He's not dressed for this altitude.
908,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,A lot less traffic since morals have decreased.
909,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,This cloud storage thing is getting ridiculous.
921,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He doesn’t have a prayer
922,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Just pretend you didn’t see him!
928,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Keep going. That guy looks flighty.
967,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"The ghost of DB Cooper has to hang out someplace, but this is creepy."
990,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Don’t let him get caught in the engine like those darn birds.
1030,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"He looks creepy, let’s not stop"
1042,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Not even for Neil Young?
1043,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Is Jack Kerouac at it again?
1048,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,..these guys always get me...how the heck do they expect us to stop.
1059,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,SOMEONE sure has a lot of storage!
1077,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Uber has just gone too far.
1083,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Homeless on cloud 9. Need help to Homeless on cloud 9. Need to get back to earth.
1087,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,If we pick him up we will be late to where we are going.
1103,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Did you read a hitch hikers guide to the galaxy ?
1144,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Its Trump’s nominee for secretary of NASA!
866,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Well, that is one way to get around security."
1336,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I don’t think he is TSA approved.
1369,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,IDK . . . can we believe a guy who's too old to be wearing ripping-jeans?
1593,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Damn Millennials, they are so lazy, won’t even go through security."
1602,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,There he is again.
1617,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Sure looks like Arthur Dent.
1620,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Where does he expect us to land?
1629,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Just keep flying, it's just that D.B. Copper jerk again."
1641,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Are you carrying more than 3 ounces of cloud water?
1656,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Nah....his carry-on looks too big.
1663,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Welp, that settles it, everything's in the cloud these days."
1667,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,And to your left you can see cloud nine.
1672,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Even St. Peter is cutting back on travel expenses.
1698,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Sorry pal. Picture yourself in a boat on a river.

1717,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,There's one of the few survivors from the sixties.
1724,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Yeah, I used to pick up hitchhikers, too, but, you know, one too many weird experiences."
1729,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I'm willing to give this air head a little latitude.

1417,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Maybe not this time. I heard he was under a cloud.

1471,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I remember him! I told him yesterday to step outside if he wanted to smoke.

421,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,You can always tell when you enter Colorado airspace.
427,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,At least someone thinks I'm doing a good job.
437,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,That dude's always on Cloud Nine. I learned early on to pass him by.
263,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Don't pull over, he looks high."
438,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"""I guess he couldn't get a direct flight""."
258,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I want some of what he's on.
228,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"We can't stop, the only spare seat we have is in Business Class."
3423,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Should we pick him up?” “I don’t think so, he looks higher than we are."
7,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Looks like the virtual reality exhibit is facing some budget cuts.
11,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Radio that they can stop looking for D.B Cooper
36,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Don’t do it. This guy looks high.
45,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,The Hitchhiker’s guide to no gravity.
59,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Let's keep going. He's too high.
60,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Forget it. He's high.
68,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I thought you said that this flight would go off without a hitch!
75,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Keep going. The skies are not that friendly.
105,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Must be flying on points.
106,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Don't stop: that carry-on looks too big.
107,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Ok, so you see him too?"
115,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Flying standby is not what it used to be.
119,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,It's the airline's newest version of standby.
168,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Hitchhike, highjack. I always get those two mixed up."
176,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"....seven...eight...yup, its cloud nine"
183,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,It's easier if you don't make eye contact.
200,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,The new mileage program has its drawbacks.
226,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,It's best to pretend you don't see fellow travelers.
240,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Don't stop. It looks like he's headed up.
461,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,No need to stop. He's already on cloud nine.
476,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Never pick them up when they are on the left side of the road.
479,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Normally I stop for those guys but there's a purgatory near here.
652,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Isn't that your son-in-law?
655,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,It's the Colorado effect.
662,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Don't swing around. He's a member of the NRA.
673,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Fly Me to the Moon
684,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,We should pick him up. He's got smokehouse almonds in that backpack.
696,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Is it just me, or have things gotten stranger since California legalized pot?"
717,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"If nothing else, that DB Cooper is tenacious."
727,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I say we pass him. There must be a reason the last plane let him off there.
729,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Should we stop and pick him up? He might have extra tickets to the Grateful Dead concert.
734,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Y'know, it's a shame Rod Serling made them out to be such bad guys..."
759,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Don’t worry. By tomorrow he’ll come down on his own.
763,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,What's the worst that could happen if we stopped to pick him up?
767,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,The pilot's manual strongly advises against stopping to pick up hitchhikers.
769,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Reminds me of an old hippie joke about Nixon
783,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Does he really need a ride or is he just giving us a thumb's up?
784,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,We have one seat left in first class...let him catch el cheapo airlines behind us.
785,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I knew they shouldn't have legalized it!
789,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,And I thought his Guide to the Galaxy was just a metaphor.
818,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Oh! There’s D B Cooper !
644,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,That’s a first!
640,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Who took the LSD - us or him?
638,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Dude! Cloud COMPUTING. Not commuting.
637,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"I'd stop, but this flight is overbooked."
495,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Another one who thought he could go off the grid in the cloud.
499,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,The company rules are very clear: no stopping for anyone cloud hopping.
503,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Who hitchhikes anymore?
520,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,This is in our living will.
524,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Don't stop.
535,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I don't think his bag will fit in the overhead bins.
536,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Yeah, I see him too. Last time he was asking for spare change."
542,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Economy class is just not what it used to be.
545,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Another member of the mile high club
1748,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"""Should we pick him up""?"
548,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,You see these guys whenever it's cloudy over Portland.
560,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Looks like he already got a lift.
566,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"I don't know, he looks pretty high."
567,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Last week some cloud hopper tried to squeegee the windshield.
601,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,It's so sad when someone realizes that cloud nine is just another cloud.
613,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Don't be dramatic, I'm sure there's an empty overhead compartment for his carry on."
619,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I hate storing things on the cloud.
624,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Cloud 9?
634,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"I'm sorry sir, that carry on exceeds 18 inches."
636,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Hitchhiker to the galaxy? I've already seen that movie.
549,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Help me get higher.
1752,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Sir, he certainly has come up in the world. Last week, I heard, he was walking on water."
432,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Someone wants airplane ride.
1772,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,You seen how many steps that Stairway to Heaven has?
2829,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I feel sorry for him. All the flights on this route are overbooked.
2834,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Don't stop. That thumb isn't in a full upright and locked position.
2837,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,We must be above Amsterdam.
2845,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Look, another hitchhiker to the galaxy"
2846,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Cloud Nine has really done downhill in this economy.
2849,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"How ""high"" do you think he is ?"
2851,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"That guy never should have said ""Galaxy."""
2856,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Just ignore him.. he's one of those nutjob Galaxy Hitchhiker wannabes always making jokes about Uranus.
2873,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Think of the paperwork if we stop.
2880,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He’ll be OK. The Tesla will pick him up.
2897,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Normally I'd stop, but that backpack isn't going to fit in the overhead bin"
2898,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,There for the grace of God go I.
2899,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Are you sure you want to come with us? We are on our way to hell.
2908,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,No telling what he has in that duffel.
2926,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Safety and airline fees are not factors, besides, he has heaven's blessings."
2928,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"More cost-cutting at 'Chutes-R-Us, I see."
2932,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Head in the clouds, and feet, too."
2935,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Quick, roll up the windows"
2938,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Yeah, I'd hitchhike all over... but that was different lifetime. Why?"
2816,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Don't pick him up. FAA Reg. 213. He could be a terrorist in disguise!
2946,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Don't stop. This is how Cold Blood started.
2813,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I'm not a right wing Republican!
2804,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,New age hippies and their existential traveling are becoming a menace.
2671,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"No room, we over book."
2676,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Jerry Garcia went from truckin' to cloudin'.
2678,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I never trust anyone over thirty thousand feet.
2679,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Ask him if he’s willing to pitch in for gas.
2684,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Keep driving, she looks nothing like her OKCupid photo."
2696,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He does know this isn't Spirit Airlines right?
2709,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"'If we keep really quiet, he might not cirrus'"
2719,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Cloud 9 must not be as great as they say.
2727,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,How high are we right now Rob?
2733,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Typical back packer, trying to travel on a tight budget."
2736,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Oh.. in that case, we usually just call it in as a ""bird strike."""
2744,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,The TSA is not going to like this!
2747,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"He's a clean looking lad, to bad we're fully booked."
2754,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Looks like he could be high.
2757,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Don't be fooled by the hidden parachute. It is not a backpack - ignore him. He will try to fly for free.
2767,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Have you cleared security?
2777,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Well a hitchhiker REALLY isn't something you see everyday. It looks like he fell right out of the 60s.
2780,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Don't stop. He looks like he's high to me.
2788,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,'He looks ok but I might have clouded judgement.'
2808,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Gee, I'm having a serious flashback to my youth. You better handle the controls."
2950,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Thumbs up to heaven
2955,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,It's Timothy Leary!
2956,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Let's leave him in the 70s with Truth, Justice and the American Way."
3233,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He's probably just going as far as Cloud Nine.
3240,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,You know -- that guy who wrote 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
3250,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Look John! Another hippie trying to hitch hike his way to Mars.
3267,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Might have a gun.
3280,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Guess Mexico wouldn't fund the ""Stairway to Heaven"" either."

3333,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He hasn't got a hope in hell
3336,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I heard about him. He is tired of having to play a harp all the time.
3344,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Looks like Buck Rodgers missed the plane.
3346,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He took it pretty hard when Holy Trinity broke up over creation differences.
3354,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,We can't pick him up. He looks high.
3360,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"If he’s supposed to be my replacement, at least he could have dressed the part."
3369,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Another United passenger kicked off the airplane.
3396,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He's avoiding economy class
1756,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Gary Larson called he wants his joke back
3407,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Can I hitch a ride and the friendly skies of United ?
3214,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He looks like a terrorist. Don't pick him up.
3212,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I guess heaven can wait
3202,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Sorry we don’t stop at the pearly gates.
3195,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,It's the only way for some angels to get their wings.

2978,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Lift to New York?
2985,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I told you cloudsourcing passengers was a bad idea.
2998,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Looks like a Byrd strike to me, Sully."
3019,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,We're Budget Air not Budget Bus.
3021,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Good job, guys!"
3024,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,We have just reached er...weirdo heaven.
3041,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Pull over, I know that guy."
3067,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"He must have taken ""cloud computing"" literally."
2663,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Don’t stop. He’s high as a kite.
3077,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Don't stop! That might be DB Cooper.
3118,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Must have had a much tougher life than the guy we passed on Cloud 9.
3120,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,My goodness! This takes the cake for getting a support animal on board.
3129,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I’ve seen more and more of them since Colorado legalized marijuana.
3130,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"That's DB! Looks like the money didn't do him much good, should have invested it."
3136,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Keep driving, he seems high."
3179,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,The marijuana’s stronger than it used to be.
3185,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I think we've been listending to too much Jefferson Airplane.
3186,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I've only made that mistake once.
3189,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Don't make eye contact. They're always going our way, but they can never pay the carry-on charge."
3088,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,That's the new TSA pre-check.
2661,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Looks like he uploaded too much of his personal information to the cloud.
3247,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,He probably just hates going through airport security.
2653,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"I don't think so, Don, he looks really high.."
1972,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"The ""scattered crowd"" forecast wasn't a typo."
1983,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Look, another one fed up with the long wait in purgatory."
1986,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Yup, the clouds are definitely thickening."
2000,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Some guys just don't want to pay the landing fee on the budget airlines.
2009,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"I don't report UFO, or D. B. Cooper sightings."
2023,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Don't even think about it: it is commendable that you were able to land on your feet after being Trump's pilot, but you can't save that guy--running the FAA requires a different skill set!!!"
2029,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Shirely he can't expect us to pull over.
2030,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Lift to cloud nine?
2037,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Say... what's a hipster doing way up here in a cloud bank>
2038,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Just another fan of your movie, Sully."
2039,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Personally, I'd stop. The risk is worth the baggage fee and he'll ride in the back."
2040,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I know we shouldn't...but it's Neal Young!
2056,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I blame Douglas Adams.
2064,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,We can’t really stop; we’ll just have to wing it.
2066,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I thought hitchhiking was outlawed.
2067,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Jesus, Shmeezus, this is a no-boarding zone."
2068,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Well we could pullover, but then the other 150 passengers could be sucked out the door. Your call Captain."
2080,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,That's our new Basic Economy boarding process.
2094,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Oops. I wish our wing were a little shorter.
1960,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Not only is he without a boarding pass, but I bet he hasn't gone through the TSA checkpoint either."
2100,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Nah . . . The ""cloud"" only stores stuff like files, photos, and recipes. No people."
1957,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,It's hard to tell if he had taken his shoes off.
1938,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Fool me once, Clark Kent..."
1773,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"I'm not sure you'll ever sell me on the ease of retrieving from The Cloud, Ken."
1778,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Look, it's Ford Prefect."
2656,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Did you see that homeless angel?
1783,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,They are getting so strict about frequent flier miles running out.
1787,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,The hitchhikers guide to frequent flyer miles.
1798,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Keep driving. He'll never afford the checked baggage fee.
1825,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"It's Arthur Dent, coming home."
1831,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"This might be awkward, but in case that’s God, you mind giving up the co-pilot seat?"
1836,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"What do you think, drone or stoner?"
1856,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"I dont know captain, I am concerned he's ""High on something"""
1862,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Graham says I have to go...
1869,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Going up?
1874,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,...I thought the simulator covered every contingency...
1884,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Yeah, but in my dream, all the passengers had legroom."
1887,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Perhaps overly inspired by that hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy?
1888,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Just ask yourself, ""What would Sully do?"""
1890,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Ignore him. That guy is higher than a kite.
1897,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"No, I think he's just saying 'good job flying that thing.'"
1931,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Ok, I guess this guy's the limit."
1955,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"A soon-to-be ‘?wing-tipped sky-tumbler,’ I'm afraid."
2104,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,That's the problem working in the cloud; commuting.
1818,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,That's one way to avoid a TSA pat-down.
2126,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"He's giving us the thumbs up, we're good to go"
2342,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I never download anything from the cloud.
2641,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Let us give him a ride; hitchhiking is legal here.
2358,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Let him go, Bernie. He's only on cloud 6. You know we don't pick up anybody below cloud 9."
2371,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,That must be the new iCloud app I heard about.
2633,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"The last time we picked him up, for days the cockpit smelled like reefer."
2386,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Whaddaya know! We're already Yellow Springs already. Must have a tailwind.
2398,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Could be the Devil in hippie clothing.
2421,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Is it possible maybe Jack Kerouac DIDN'T go to hell?
2427,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I think he is trying to join the mile hitch 'high'king club.
2459,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I wish we'd never started this rideshare program.
2465,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Boarding Group 9 has his work cut out for him.
2498,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Can you help a guy who's out of cloud storage?
2511,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Still needs a lift down to Yasgur’s farm?
2536,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"I think we're too close to the lake again, Captain."
2544,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Need a descent?
2117,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Let’s not stop. I think he’s high.
2547,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,OMG that’s Ufo.
2566,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"I'm sorry sir, but your backpack is too big for our overhead compartments."
2585,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Oh oh, is William Shatner on board?"
2339,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Looks like he’s on cloud 9 . Better not stop
2331,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Only if he chips in for gas.
2414,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Ok Jim.. What did you put in my Red Bull this time?!
2319,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,You know what they say: The grass is always greener on the other cloud.
2128,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I thought they only did data!
2324,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I always figured cloud 9 for a lonely place.
2645,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"We’re going to Portland, why not?"
2134,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"That's Douglas Adams - don't make eye contact! If we pick hm up, who knows where we'd wind up."
2148,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,That’s me when I retire....
2149,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Looks like another one has been transferred to the cloud!
2168,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Shame there are no empty seats. Give him a thumbs up anyway.
2174,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Looks like he's stuck on cloud eight.
2177,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,For sure that's too big for carry-on.
2196,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Watch that wing!
2131,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,"Keep going, he looks high."
2211,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Looks like we have another freak went flyer on stand by.
2206,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Psssst...are we dead?
2296,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,didn't we see him trying to board before we left JFK
2292,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,Can't blame the guy. Rent on a studio apartment in Heaven has increased ninety percent over the last three years.
2278,1325,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,606,I think the company's 'pay as you go' plan needs a few tweaks.

3492,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,"Nah, I don't think so. I picked up a guy that looked like him last week and he reeked of jet fuel."
3447,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Oh, we see them quite often. Poor souls make it to the gates, but don't make the cut. Got a long fall ahead of them and hoping for a lift."
3448,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,He seems high. Let's not stop.
3449,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,He’s been that way ever since his Mod flunked Crirical Design Review

3458,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,We shouldn't give him anything. He'll probably just buy drugs with it.
3459,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I think that's illegal...

3469,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Don't stop, he's on the left wing side, it's not of our business, only people on the right side are allowed to fly! We could get fired for breaking the company's rule! And the president is a bit touchy on this..."
3470,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I imagine he wants to get higher than we'll be going.
3471,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,"That guy looks really high, and this ""everything is in the cloud"" stuff is really out of control."

3473,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,I've noticed more of this with the legalization of marijuana.
3475,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,We must be flying over California.
3477,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Super high hiker
3481,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Looks like he took the high road.

3486,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Keep going. He probably wants a ride for the peanuts.
3487,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Hey Bob, what's that mountain climber doing on top of that cloud?"
3490,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,We shouldn’t pick him up. That guy is as high as a kite.
3466,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Poor guy.....if he's still there on the next pass we'll pick him up.
3358,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"We're at capacity, let's hope that dummy in the Tesla picks him up."
3357,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Maybe we can pick him up on the flight back.
3356,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,What's the airline's policy on picking up deadheads?
3220,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Don't hang around, baby, twos a crowd."

3225,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Seen him before. He never gets further than Cloud 6.
3226,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Let's pick him up, he's TSA Pre,"
3228,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Don't pull over. He's doing fine on cloud nine.

3603,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,I guess he's out of cloud storage.
3604,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Let's stop. He might have gas money.

5956,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Probably just the latest TSA security test.
5957,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,It's too bad this is a nonstop flight.

5964,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I didn't know the frequent flyer miles expired.
5965,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I think he is trying to get to cloud nine.
5966,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Looks like Dent forgot his towel
5970,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Another one who travels on a wing and a prayer.

5974,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,"Most of them are headed to cloud nine, but that’s not on our route, so it would be best to leave it to the planes that are headed there."
5975,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,He must be our deadhead to San Francisco.
5976,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,There’s one empty seat. Too bad it’s in first class.
5977,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I guess he got lost on his way to Cloud Nine.
5979,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,That must have been some kick ass weed.
5981,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Let’s keep driving. He looks high.
5982,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Poor devil...Cloud Nine must not be what it's cracked up to be.
5983,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"No, more turn around flights management said we need to think outside of the box tell him we are overbooked works for me"
5984,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,What's he high on?
5987,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I’m not stopping. I don’t like his altitude.
5988,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Don't stop; he's clearly high.
5989,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,It's some dorky guy with a quizzical look on his face - that's not art!
5990,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I notice his thumb is pointed upward. Do you think he is trying to hitchhike to heaven?
5991,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,I think God is trying to tell us something.
5950,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,That’s what happens when you end up on Cloud Eight.
5948,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,It's probably just a quantum fluctuation.
5947,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,"Delta, stop! I want a flight out of Georgia."
5946,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"For the passengers on the left, not to worry, this is a non-stop flight."
5896,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Oh, he's just in economy standby class"
5897,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Is HE the guy who wrote Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy?
5898,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Guess he dropped the tin-can schtick
5899,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Looks like an opportunity for UBER to expand its horizons !

5902,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I guess we do one way trips to Heaven now too.
5903,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Do you have any checked luggage?

5915,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,he really wants to maintain his gold status...!
5894,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,There he is again on cloud nine.
5916,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I hate stopping for these extreme discount standby passengers.

4784,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,He's with that new super economy fare plan. Bags fly for free but passengers don't get to board.

4804,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Just roll up the window and pretend you don't see him.

5260,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"We can take you as far as Cloud 7, you’ll have to find a way to get the rest of the way."
5261,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Looks like he’s taking this cloud thing literally.
5262,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,This is the new TSA Pre-Check procedure
5263,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I see what happened. He uploaded himself to the cloud. Now he can’t get back.
5265,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Coach? Can I be upgraded to first class?
5222,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,"No, don’t pick him up...we kicked him off my last flight...his bag wouldn’t fit in the overhead."
5220,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I'd say that he's carried the idea of wanderlust a bit far.
5218,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,How’d he get up here?
5216,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,He certainly sticks out like a sore thumb.
5176,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Don’t stop. With that back pack he might be a terrorist merely pretending to be dead.
5177,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Hey you! Get off of my cloud. Hey you! Get off of my Cloud.
5178,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Think he would want 38d, it’s a middle seat in coach next to the crying baby?"
5179,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Ignore him. His bag is way over the carry-on size limit.
5180,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Probably just some Deadhead.
5182,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Not again! Watch the left engine!
5183,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Well, I'd say he's definitely higher than a kite."
5185,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I’d stop except we have no more room for carry-ons
5187,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,They never warn you about coming down from cloud9.
5188,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"See, even that rando agrees you can totally pass for Stan Lee in his cameo roles after he dies, Captain."

5190,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I guess Cloud 9 isn't what it used to be.
5191,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Now there's a cool frood.
5192,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,"Tim, if you wouldn’t mind scooting over a little..."

5193,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Yeah, due to cutbacks they only earn one wing at a time."

5200,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,You're telling me there are more of these guys still trying to get home from Woodstock?
5202,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Used to be I'd stop
5205,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Wow! Weather forecasting is getting more and more accurate. This morning's paper called for cumulus clouds with occasional Gen - X hitchhikers.
5206,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,It's all right. The wing will get him.
5207,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Ignore him. Just another snowflake looking for a free ride.
5208,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Cloud 9 this is Delta Air. Without that fuel tax, we can't land. We'll Circle back for you in a minute!"
5209,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,These back to back double shifts are making me see poor people.
5210,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Where's guide to the galaxy?
5211,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Just another hitchhiker trying to get to cloud nine.
5214,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,We aren't that friendly.
5215,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Guessing we'll have to wait for the Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy sequel to make sense of all this...
5194,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Actually 34B is open.
5267,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Is this what they mean by uploading to the cloud?
5268,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Can we at least offer him some peanuts?

5317,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Better speed up. These guys like to jump on the wings to disturb the passengers.
5318,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,How dangerous could he be? TSA cleared him.
5319,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I swear that's Clark Gable! Take her around again and see if we can't get a shot of Claudette Colbert showing some leg.
5320,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Did another state legalize marijuana?

1437,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Because he has a bad altitude

1542,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Ask Alexa what our wingspan is.
1543,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,I blame SpaceX for this.
1546,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I wouldn't. I bet he hasn't had a bath for weeks.

1458,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Don't stop for him; that bag will never fit in the overhead bin.
1459,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,We don't even have a scanner to check his passport and boarding pass.
1461,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I guess someone sent him to the cloud.
1462,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I always wondered what happened to Kerouac.
1463,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,He’s gonna have to check that bag though.
1464,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,It won't fit in the overhead.
1465,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Hippie
1466,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Should we stop and pick him up?
1499,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Sully would know what to do.

1473,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Now I understand why they call this route 'the highway to heaven'.
1474,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Yikes. Control tower requesting a lower altitude.
1476,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Ignore him. He’s selling another guide to the galaxy.
1477,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,He's going the wrong way.

1480,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Do you think he's looking for Air B&B?
1481,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,What’s he on?
1483,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I think it's time to put on the oxygen masks.
1486,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,What else is he supposed to do? Mick Jagger kicked him off.
1490,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,He sure gets around; yesterday we passed him over Omaha.
1492,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I wonder what he's high on?
1493,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"On your left, a former passenger who finally found his lost luggage."

1470,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,I see United overbooked again.

1347,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,And you didn't see anything either!
1202,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,"The Rolling Stones right? ""...Hey! You! Get off of my cloud..."""
1204,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Guess they closed the stairway to heaven.

1211,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Don’t stop. I bet he’s high.
1215,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,It's against policy to pick up anyone on cloud nine.
1217,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,You see a lot of them now since they started deporting them too.

378,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"If he's still there, we'll pick him up on the way back."
621,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I didn't think Dead & Company were on tour right now.
623,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,We're just a little too close to that mountain top
625,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"I know we're not supposed to pick them up, but can we put them down?"
629,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Guess he is tired of Cloud 9.
630,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Are you sure we didn't drink the mushroom tea from Peru?
632,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,It's going to be a rude awakening when he comes down from whatever he's on.
635,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,That carry-on isn't going to fit in the overhead.
642,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Probably couldn't afford the excess baggage fees.
645,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,So that's what happened to DB Cooper!
646,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Wonder how far he's going?
649,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Talk about a no frills airline!
650,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Why bother? That wing is about to make him half the man he is now.
651,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,"The altimeter is showing 35,000 feet but I think we're higher than that."
654,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,He asked Delta for an upgrade after the Olympics.
656,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,I think he's looking for a ride.
657,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,He's doomed. It's only partly cloudy.
658,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Aha, an Elon Projection"
660,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,What - when did Neil Young die? I thought he was just burned out.
661,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,It must suck when your frequent flyer miles only get you half way.
663,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I knew these drones were going to be a problem.
665,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Add some hair and I swear that’s D.B. Cooper.
667,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,We can't stop for just anyone.
668,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Sure, those jetpacks sound like a great idea till you run out of fuel."
669,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I think we just found D.B. Cooper.
671,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Last time we stopped for someone it didn't work out well.
672,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,He must be as high as a kite.
674,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,We're not stopping. My first three wives all left me for Nick Cave.
675,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Didn't we just pass him on Cloud Eight?
676,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,I think we'd better pick him up. This might be a test.
620,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Head in the clouds, these guys are all the same."
618,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Times are pretty turbulent.
617,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Naw, he's only on Cloud Eight."
615,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Will navigate for food.
578,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,The dude is clearly higher than a kite if he thinks we're gonna give him a ride!
579,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Well, then, he shouldn’t have sent his car into orbit."
581,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Better not risk it. He looks high to me.
582,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,We must be flying over San Francisco.
583,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,There's that guy again. He's always high.
584,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Remind me to read 'The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy'.
585,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I can never tell if Andy Kaufman is joking or being serious.
586,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,The nerve of that guy; he knows we were overbooked!
588,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Don't stop for him. Next thing you know, he'll want food service too."
590,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"I'd stop, but quite frankly, we'd plummet to our deaths."
591,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,He's high if he thinks we're going to stop to pick him up.
592,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I think he likes our in-flight movie.
593,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Things have changed a lot since Uber bought the airline
594,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Are you guys going Southwest?
677,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Don't pick him up! He's high!
596,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"He’s already in heaven, so he probably won’t kill us."
598,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Yes Ron, I know these are the friendly skies, but NO...we’re not stopping!"
599,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,What say we show Elon Musk who really controls the airspace?
600,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I told him it was just a Rolling Stones song.
602,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,God must be his copilot.
603,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,He is definitely not on cloud 9.
604,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Wow! I have NEVER seen anyone that needed a manicure more than that guy.
605,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,I think I ate some bad peanuts...
606,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,How's it going on cloud 9?
607,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Next time I'll have a Virgin Mary with dinner!
609,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Oh look, a drifter."
610,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,It's an Unidentified Freeloading Object.

612,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"It may not look like a mushroom cloud, but it sure smells like one."
614,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Struggling harpists! Why don't they get that we can't divert from our flight plan?
597,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,It's Arthur Dent!!
678,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,I never get used to these Deadhead flights.

680,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"When we land don't mention him, we'll get fired for being alcoholics."
720,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,He's on cloud 8 - so close.
721,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Did you also have of that orange juice they serve in first class?
722,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,"""TSA regs don't allow hitchhikers Alvin""."

728,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Another thumbs up from him? Better check the wings and engines...
730,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Before the TSA I used to pick them all up.
731,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Another young kid with his head in the clouds.
732,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Where's TSA when you need 'em?
735,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"I think we can stop to pick him up, he only has one carry on."
736,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,We could stop to ask directions.
737,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Okay, we'll pick him up. But you have to land this thing!"
738,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,How the hell do I know - I guess I just pushed the wrong key on my computer.
740,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,So that's where California sends them.
719,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Forgot my iCloud password...
741,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Don't even think about it captain - that head wind over Denver already put us 45 minutes behind.
743,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,The new organic ethanol fuel is a big hit with the spiritual environmentalists!

749,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,To think I chose to be a pilot to get rid of hitchhikers!
751,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Is that Starman from the SpaceX roadster?
752,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I've seen a big uptick in hitchhighkers since legalization.
753,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Ground Control--This is Flight #42. We have a visual on the Hitchhiker. He is clouding around.

756,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Just ignore him; I'm done doing favors for relatives.
758,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Not even if this was a helicopter.
761,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,We can't pick him up. Look at the size of that carry-on.
762,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,What should we charge for a partial flight?
764,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Another 'Lifted Up' half way, then 'Left Behind!'"

742,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Oh ... him again.
577,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Another one on his way down from Cloud 9.
718,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Another feeble attempt without a reservation.
715,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"He'd have to check the bag, though."

682,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,I’m not sure about this one.
683,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,they just appear from nowhere. I wonder where they are going
685,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,No way that bag is fitting in the overhead compartment.
687,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Truckin'...like the do-dah man, keep truckin'..."

689,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Do you think we should pull over?
690,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,"So,the GPS says turn left at the pedestrian on the cloud. Wow, this last update is specific."
691,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Going my way?
692,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Do you think his affiliation is right wing or left wing?
693,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,"And for the first time since flight school, Ralph and Benny would have to make a split second decision."
694,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Didn't we see him when we left Denver?
695,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"To be worthy of a ride, he'd have his own jet."
697,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,No halo. Looks like he missed out.
716,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,That Elon Musk is quite a character.
698,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,There’s no way that will fit in the overheads.

701,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Maybe he can give us a break, take a turn flying this thing."
702,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Another airhead on Cloud Nine.

433,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I say no. He looks like he might have some kind of weird comfort animal.
435,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,No way - that carry-on would never fit in the overhead bin.
436,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Let's not stop. He's probably no angel.
439,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Another feather-headed lightweight with no respect for boundaries.
441,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Keep going - he looks really high.

384,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Don't trust him. His cloud service got hacked last week.
385,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Captain are you sure that was a virgin margarita?
386,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Let's pick him up. He might have some pot to share.
387,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Should we download some more live music from the cloud?

396,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I think he's telling us we're doing a good job.
397,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Same guy we dropped off over Nebraska.
398,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"I don't know Captain, If we pick him up, we'll have to bump another passenger!"

404,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Looks like cloud nine lost its luster.
405,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,It’s easier than going through TSA.
406,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Well you gotta give them credit for thinking above the norm...
407,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"That's what he gets for trying to carry on his guitar, instead of trusting us to handle it."

409,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I thought Howard Hughes passed away.
410,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Keep flying. Space X will give him a lift.
411,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Sorry, it's ass, grass, or cash. No one rides for free."
413,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,I'm not doing him - we've picked up three already
416,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,What looks suspicious about him to you?
417,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,This happens every time ticket fares go up.
418,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Hey bros. Could you give me a lift to the nearest highway to Heaven.
420,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Fine, but you have to open the door this time"
401,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Damn... am I high, or is he?"

522,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Let him take an Uber
523,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Careful Sully, he looks pretty sullied."

527,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,If we give him a lift he’ll be on cloud nine.
528,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Is that DB Cooper?
529,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I never stop. They all play the same Rolling Stones song.
530,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I really have to stop watching old Twilight Zone episodes before each flight.
531,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Another drifter? Airlock the doors.
537,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Isn’t that the guy we booted off on the way over?
538,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Maybe we are too low?
539,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,You see it too? Yeah I told you that damn airline fish would do us in one day.
541,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,I guess Starman got bored out there in space.
543,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,"We can close our eyes to the plight of the skies. Dave, you noticing all this plight?"

553,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Looks like another state legalized marijuana.
556,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Don’t panic.
557,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Last time we picked up a hitchhiker she was a real angel
558,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"I felt bad putting him out, but he didn't pay the extra fee to go the whole way."
559,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I thought hitchhiking was against the law.
561,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,"Hey, Mark! Remember me?"
562,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Some people never know when to quit.
563,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,We should at least offer him some peanuts.
564,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Captain, is he cirrus?"
565,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"We can take him, but he'll have to check his bag."
570,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Keep going ... That backpack looks bigger than the allowable carry-on size and I’ll bet he doesn’t have the $25 bucks on him.
571,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Sorry this is a non-stop.
546,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,"I would, but he might be a hijacker."
575,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Roger, we are over Denver."
517,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,I guess the Tesla moon landing effort had some problems!
514,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,He looks high.
472,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"It's okay, the wing will get him."
473,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Ass, grass or gas....no one flies for free."

477,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Seems like everything is on the Cloud these days
480,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Coming down off cloud nine is never easy
482,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Didn't we just pass him a few clouds ago?
484,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Oh, to be young, carefree and high again..."
486,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,It's best if you don't make eye contact.
487,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Poor guy. He made it to the Pearly Gates. But the wrong Gate!
488,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Moral of the story: never board a United Airlines flight with too much carry-on.
489,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,It must be spring break at Hey U.
490,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,What would Sully do?
491,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,"Jog a little left, we can suck him right in."
492,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,I thought that guy was an angel at first!
516,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,He refuses to take the stairway to heaven.
493,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,"Oh, Shit! (Note: these are the most common last words recorded on the cockpit voice recorder in fatal aircraft accidents.)"
496,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Which airline do you think dropped him off?
497,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"If he got this far, he can get himself the rest of the way."
498,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Now, that's odd. You don't see many hitchhikers anymore."
500,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Let's stop -- he seems like a first-class guy.
501,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Things people do to avoid the TSA line...
504,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Never trust a hitch-hiker on a strange cloud.
505,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,"He can't afford a plan ticket, but those ripped jeans are definitely designer"
506,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Ignore him! He's obviously high.
507,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Pretty soon you boys will be out of business.
508,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Didn't we recently see this in a 'New Yorker' magazine cartoon?
509,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Is he hitchhiking or recommending the mashed potatoes?

2794,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,That guy looks like my mother.
2795,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Another strike against the companies policy on not taking pictures.
2796,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,He's looking for a miracle.

2799,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,He must have run out of frequent flyer miles!

2801,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Let him in. It’s a long flight. We could use a little levity.
2802,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,You really never know how high they are when you pick them up.

2805,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Better not; I hear there is a cirrocumulus asylum nearby.
2807,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Hey Sully, that’s the same guy we left on Cloud 9."

2870,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Well at least this hallucination is not as scary as the one in that Twilight Zone episode.
2871,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,David Mitchell.

2929,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Looks like Arthur Dent to me.
2930,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Cloud Lyft? I mean I had to ask. It’s like he’s offering up his thumb as a souvenir.
2931,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,We might have a problem with our altimeter.
2933,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Do you think he will mind that this is a full flight and his carry-on will have to be checked in until we reach destination?
2934,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I didn't see him either
2937,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Fine, we'll let the passengers decide then."
2939,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,He'd have better luck if he weren't insistent on going to LaGuardia.
2940,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Not yet. You'll know by the guy when we get to Cloud 9.
2942,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,How did he even make it up here?
2944,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"You don't earn as many miles, but there's usually an empty seat"

2947,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,You don't see many of them anymore...
2924,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Don't stop; it might be a trick.
2948,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"And if you look very closely, that cloud looks like a hitchhiker."
2952,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,I'd stop for him if he hadn't already reached his destination.
2953,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,"Uh, gee, you know, Jim, despite the hitchhiking and bohemian style of dress, considering his cruising altitude alone, I think there’s more you could have said about him than just “Wow, he’s really working hard to do the non-conformist vibe."""

2957,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I wouldn't stop. I hear this is a bad section of sky.
2958,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Happens all the time when we pass Cloud 9.
2960,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,And I thought our company's economy class was bare bones.

2963,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"I guess he forgot the lyrics ""You can't catch a jet plane like you can a freight train."
2964,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I say we put him in 2B next to Pruitt.
2966,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Is there still a reward for D.B. Cooper?
2967,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I guess cloud nine's not all it's cracked up to be.
2969,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Welcome to Frontier Airlines.
2970,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,You would think He'd give his only son a ride.
2951,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"I'm not sure we should give him a lift, he looks like a bit of a floater"
2972,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,He is in I cloud and forgot his password.
2923,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,"Ordinarily I'd pick him up, but this is a dangerous place to stop."
2920,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Maybe if his carry on wasn't so big . . .
2874,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,"Yes, we could give him a lift, but TSA would never forgive us."
2875,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I am guessing that is D. B. Cooper

2878,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Cloud travel seems sensible in an age of cloud computing.
2879,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Don't stop - he creeps me out.

1865,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Somebody's read 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' a little too literally.
1866,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"I told you, you cannot save miles to the Cloud"
1868,2082,0,0,7,7,1.0,0.1543033499620919,606,I heard cloud commuting was gaining followers.
1870,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"I don't care if he's TSA Pre, we can't pick him up."
1871,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Don't make eye contact, he just wants to make you feel guilty for not stopping."
1872,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,I don't know about this Gerald. We don't even know if his bag fits in the over head bin.
1873,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I remember when this place had such a rarefied atmosphere
1877,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"No, it's Iowa."
1879,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,It’s our newest Economy Basic.
1880,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Keep going, that guy looks as high as a kite!"
1881,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I sometimes wish that I had chosen to reach a higher plane in a pure manner like that fellow rather than the way we do it.
1885,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Do you think he knows why no one stops?
1889,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,"Always trying to leave Cloud Nine, that one there!"
1893,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,"He takes ""cloud storage"" a little too literally!"
1916,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Torn jeans are so passe.
1894,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Don't stop, just keep going - he appears to be high."
1898,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,This is your captain speaking. We've just been given the thumbs up to make our descent.
1899,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Mother warned me to never pick up hitchhikers.
1901,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,He must have missed his connecting flight.
1902,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,He must have Air Jordans.
1903,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Hey, Ace! There's another Cloud Storage homeless IT guy!"
1904,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Wow. I remember those days.
1905,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,There's an idea....let's start a cloud-enabled ride-sharing service!
1907,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,He's waiting for the Uber helicopter.
1908,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"As long as he doesn't need to check his bag, I guess it would be ok."
1910,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Could be worse ... at least he's not on our wing.
1911,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,"Hey, it's better than when they clap."
1912,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,How bad must he hate TSA lines?
1913,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Don't stop! I think he's an American and armed!
1914,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Sorry pal -- sky's the limit.
1895,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,These UFO's are really getting creative.
1969,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Cloud commuting. It's new and don't ask me to explain.
1759,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Probably coming back after seeing the Dead.
1757,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,you're cool guys! I just saw a red car and the driver was so rude that he didn't even look at me!
1607,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,We do have an empty seat in economy.
1608,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Looks like another one got lost on the way to cloud nine.
6392,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,He forgot to upload his ticket to paradise.
1610,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Either he's too high or we are.
1611,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,TSA goes at great lengths trying to trick us.
1615,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Well, if it isn't D. B. Cooper!"
1619,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Don't stop. He must be high as a kite.
1621,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Just don't make eye contact with him.
1622,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Do you think Apple has gone too far with this iCloud thing?
1623,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,They didn't cover this one in flight school.
1624,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,I knew that storage in the cloud would get to this.
1626,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Some people go to new heights to hitch a ride
1627,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Looks like ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" wasn't science fiction after all."
1628,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I guess he took one of those cheap airlines where arriving is at extra-cost.
1630,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"I realize the airline needs to increase profits, but this new way to make connections is for the birds."
1631,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,There are easier ways to hitch a ride
1632,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Poor Fellow His parachute didn't open
1633,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"i told you microdosing whips ass, dude. let's do another tab."

1636,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,"Okay we've done the ""other dimensions"" exhibit, can we go to the Empire State building now?"
1637,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Welcome to Colorado.
1638,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,I just got an idea for a new fare class
1639,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"But we don't travel to an alternate universe, Sir"
1642,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Just act like you don't see him.
1644,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,these flights out of Denver keep getting weirder
1645,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,They're storing everything in the cloud these days.
1646,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,We can give him a ride but we’ll have to charge him for the bag.
1648,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"If that hitchhiker was able to get this far, I don't think he really needs us."
1649,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"From a simpler, more trusting time ... wait, is that Timothy Leary?"
1606,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,William Shatner!
1605,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Don't do it Captain. That guy's higher than a kite.
1604,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,By any chance are you passing cloud nine?
1601,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Do you think he's precheck?
1556,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Sorry mate.. we’re headed UP
1557,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Reminds me of when I was young.
1558,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Cloud 9 is not all it’s cracked up to be.
1559,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,There used to be an information highway around here.
1560,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I guess it does eliminate your wait in TSA security.
1561,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Some guys don't realize that the fog will soon or later lift.
1562,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"No, I never read it. I saw the movie though."
1563,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Why don’t you just roll down the window and ask him if he’s an axe murderer?
1564,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Isn't that the troublemaker we threw off the outbound flight?
1568,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,He’s an optimist.
1570,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Another one going to Cloud 9?
1571,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,I hope United gave him a voucher.
1572,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Another Standby!
1573,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,"Look at him! Roaming and rambling, following his uppity footsteps! What does he think this is? An endless skyway? Who does he think this land was made for?"
1650,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"No, I want to see the FAA regulation that says we can't."
1575,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Oh oh, more Air Traffic Control cutbacks."
1579,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,It's that press secretary guy who got released from Trump Tower.
1581,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,No screeners here. TSA wouldn’t like it.
1582,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Hey Bob, take a look...that one looks like a hitchhiker"
1583,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I'm feeling fly pilot.
1584,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"I'll turn my cell phone off, Promise!"
1586,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,It's against company policy to pickup hitchhikers.
1590,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,A penny for your thoughts.
1592,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,'How did he get through airport security without a ticket?' That is your question?
1594,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Cloudy with a chance of Meatloaf?
1595,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,It is against the law to stop to pick him up. Bernoulli's Law.
1596,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"If he’s come from above, we”ll take him. From below, not so fast."
1597,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,I can't believe it! That backpack will never fit under his seat.
1598,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,This new stand-by policy is so annoying.
1600,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I bet he's got more than 3 oz. of liquids in that backpack.
1578,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I told you we were too high.
1651,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I guess SpaceX still hasn't worked out those landings....
1652,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,What would Sully do?
1653,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,PULL OVER!
1705,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Pretend that he's telling you that you're doing a good job at flying.
1706,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Pick up is easy, drop off is hard"
1707,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Roger that, I said Jack Kerouac!"
1708,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Either he's on an LSD trip, or we are."
1710,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Look, Elon on cloud nine!!!!"
1711,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,"It's Colorado, they get high!"
1712,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,I'll bet he thought it was the bathroom door..
1713,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,We could pick him up but he'd have to leave his guitar behind.
1714,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,"Remember, the new airline policy is that we don't stop for drifters."
1715,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,He's totally out of his atmosphere.
1720,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,These guys are always looking for an easy ride to Cloud 9.
1721,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Yeah, that's Elvis. He hangs out on this route all the time. Just ignore him."
1723,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Oh, he's on cloud 6. I never pick up on even numbers."
1725,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"I would, but his bag looks a smidge oversize."
1704,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Everybody wants to get to Heaven, but nobody wants to die."
1726,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Don't take a chance... could be that D.B. Cooper fellow!
1731,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Signal him that we're taking the next exit.
1732,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,New carry-on policy.
1734,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Keep going - his carry-on is too large.
1736,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Another lucid dreamer.
1738,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,Someone must have saved him to the cloud.
1739,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Is that Tom Hanks?
1741,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,“Get a job”.
1742,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,That bag is way too big to carry-on.
1744,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,You hardly ever see hitchhikers anymore.
1745,2082,0,0,5,5,1.0,0.22360679774997896,606,"Hey, hey, you, you, get off of my cloud!"
1746,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,Oh Boy.... That wing is going to hurt!
1753,2082,0,0,6,6,1.0,0.18257418583505536,606,He's been high since the Sixties.
