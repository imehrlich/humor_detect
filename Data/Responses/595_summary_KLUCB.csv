3190,1074,2,18,60,80,1.275,0.05618403304872525,595,Crank up the thermostat. I need this commission.
3222,1074,4,14,62,80,1.275,0.0615593775311716,595,"Janet, he did it again; soaked the Fall line. So rude."
3335,1074,5,12,63,80,1.275,0.06407817614623443,595,Should we tell him that he is looking at the spring collection?
3452,1074,3,16,61,80,1.275,0.05893302355914537,595,Do we accept the Polar Express card?
3565,1074,4,14,62,80,1.275,0.0615593775311716,595,That man always gives me the cold chills.
3576,1074,3,16,61,80,1.275,0.05893302355914537,595,He's buying for the spring season- says he'll have lost a lot of water weight by May.
3951,1074,7,8,65,80,1.275,0.06883984348204832,595,"When I told him we didn't have his size, he nearly had a melt down!"
4058,1074,6,10,64,80,1.275,0.06650164174236887,595,Just keep him away from the silk and rayon.
4101,1074,4,14,62,80,1.275,0.0615593775311716,595,I just have a bad feeling that he may not even last till Christmas.
4159,1074,5,12,63,80,1.275,0.06407817614623443,595,"Don’t worry, I’m sure he is only temporary help !"
4195,1074,5,12,63,80,1.275,0.06407817614623443,595,He's a snowman of course he's a Temp.
4235,1074,4,14,62,80,1.275,0.0615593775311716,595,The new guy won't make it through Spring.
4383,1074,4,14,62,80,1.275,0.0615593775311716,595,"If you wait, the hat,scarf and gloves will be for sale too."
4534,1074,3,16,61,80,1.275,0.05893302355914537,595,I hate working for a boss that keeps the air conditioning on full blast.
4557,1074,3,16,61,80,1.275,0.05893302355914537,595,"He's sweating like crazy Marge, and he keeps singing ""Thumpety Thump Thump."""
4674,1074,5,12,63,80,1.275,0.06407817614623443,595,We're out of the large. If he sticks around he'll fit into the medium.
4760,1074,4,14,62,80,1.275,0.0615593775311716,595,He's just a big puddle waiting to happen.
4868,1074,4,14,62,80,1.275,0.0615593775311716,595,"He's cute, but customers say he's frosty."
4908,1074,5,12,63,80,1.275,0.06407817614623443,595,"He says to just act naturally, this is a stick-up, and he doesn't have much time."
5134,1074,4,14,62,80,1.275,0.0615593775311716,595,What do you think of the new guy? I found him a little cold.
5273,1074,6,10,64,80,1.275,0.06650164174236887,595,"This one won’t last either, I’m sure by Spring we’ll have yet another manager."
5319,1074,2,18,60,80,1.275,0.05618403304872525,595,This guy's looking for slacks in size 36 round.
5456,1074,6,10,64,80,1.275,0.06650164174236887,595,His account is frozen until spring.
5586,1074,6,10,64,80,1.275,0.06650164174236887,595,These temp workers never last very long.
5604,1074,5,12,63,80,1.275,0.06407817614623443,595,"Ever since I asked him to keep his nose out of my business, he's been giving me the cold shoulder."
4507,1074,5,12,63,80,1.275,0.06407817614623443,595,He disappears in the spring.
3148,1074,2,18,60,80,1.275,0.05618403304872525,595,He thinks he’ll be able to fit into those by springtime.
1581,1074,5,12,63,80,1.275,0.06407817614623443,595,"I agree he's cool, but doesn't the thumpity thump thump drive you nuts?"
3046,1074,4,14,62,80,1.275,0.0615593775311716,595,I can't stop staring at his nose.
179,1074,4,14,62,80,1.275,0.0615593775311716,595,That’s not what I meant when I told you I wanted to work in a cool store
275,1074,4,14,62,80,1.275,0.0615593775311716,595,Do you think he's open to a kilt?
662,1074,5,12,63,80,1.275,0.06407817614623443,595,"He works for minimum wage....and, of course, the air-conditioning."
734,1074,1,20,59,80,1.275,0.053293431803719676,595,"Well, for starters, he keeps giving me these icy stares..."
906,1074,7,8,65,80,1.275,0.06883984348204832,595,I would say that him wanting to show us his snowballs is misogynistic.
987,1074,5,12,63,80,1.275,0.06407817614623443,595,Of course they hired another white guy.
1187,1074,4,14,62,80,1.275,0.0615593775311716,595,Your job is not in danger. He's a seasonal worker.
1227,1074,6,10,64,80,1.275,0.06650164174236887,595,"He's fine, just a little frosty with the customers."
1284,1074,6,10,64,80,1.275,0.06650164174236887,595,He's just seasonal help.
3074,1074,4,14,62,80,1.275,0.0615593775311716,595,"When did the new guy get here?"" ""Oh, him? Don't worry he's only seasonal."
1467,1074,4,14,62,80,1.275,0.0615593775311716,595,These seasonal employees are here one day and gone the next. Its like they just melt away or something.
1528,1074,7,8,65,80,1.275,0.06883984348204832,595,"Is it really cold in here, or is it me?"
1426,1074,5,12,63,80,1.275,0.06407817614623443,595,He says he's transitioning.
1534,1074,6,10,64,80,1.275,0.06650164174236887,595,I don't think the new guy is warming up to me.
2947,1074,5,12,63,80,1.275,0.06407817614623443,595,"Rosario, don't freak, but I think that dude with the pointy nose could be an ICE agent."
2824,1074,6,10,64,80,1.275,0.06650164174236887,595,He wants something slimming for the summer season
1532,1074,3,16,61,80,1.275,0.05893302355914537,595,"I tried to help him , but he gave me the cold shoulder."
2631,1074,4,14,62,80,1.275,0.0615593775311716,595,I guess we'll have to take on extra duties when he has a meltdown.
2423,1074,7,8,65,80,1.275,0.06883984348204832,595,I don't care if it's a genderqueer. I still don't feel comfortable with it walking around with no pants.
2637,1074,6,10,64,80,1.275,0.06650164174236887,595,My feeling is he won't last past March.
2117,1074,5,12,63,80,1.275,0.06407817614623443,595,These seasonal hires never last long.
1921,1074,5,12,63,80,1.275,0.06407817614623443,595,The diversity hiring policy has finally gone too far.
