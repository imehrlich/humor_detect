3054,4379,0,10,70,80,1.125,0.0372087848617242,630,I remember when this was all parking lot.
2829,4379,0,10,70,80,1.125,0.0372087848617242,630,Okay global warming might have been real news.
2795,4379,2,6,72,80,1.125,0.04491553253932474,630,Bob is always right.

2690,4379,2,6,72,80,1.125,0.04491553253932474,630,I was told the swamp would be drained.
2661,4379,1,8,71,80,1.125,0.041242567416306754,630,"Yes honey, I think you did over fill the swimming pool"
2640,4379,0,10,70,80,1.125,0.0372087848617242,630,"Be a darling, Bob, and go under to the fridge and get me my smoothie."

3088,4379,1,8,71,80,1.125,0.041242567416306754,630,"I’m not surprised your beer’s lukewarm.  I’ll bet the nachos will be soggy, too."
3442,4379,1,8,71,80,1.125,0.041242567416306754,630,I was worried it might rain.
3426,4379,1,8,71,80,1.125,0.041242567416306754,630,"Climate change is a hoax, climate change is a hoax, climate change is a hoax, climate change is a......."

3402,4379,3,4,73,80,1.125,0.0483100482249156,630,I think I'm burning.
3389,4379,1,8,71,80,1.125,0.041242567416306754,630,A vacation with not-so-good tidings
3385,4379,0,10,70,80,1.125,0.0372087848617242,630,I told we should have just binge-watched Ozark.
