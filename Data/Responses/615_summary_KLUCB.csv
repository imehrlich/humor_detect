3573,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,Your Wife will like that.
3603,3710,0,13,52,65,1.2,0.05000000000000002,615,"If this lure doesn't work, nothing will."

3743,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,at least it does not have mercury in it
3780,3710,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,615,Might as well go for the big fish.
3781,3710,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,615,‘I was looking for that.’
3852,3710,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,615,My question is--how are the candles still lit?
3858,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,I'm trying to catch one of those rich girls who come here on vacation.
3864,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,Lampfish need special tackle
3878,3710,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,615,Scott Pruitt had 'em fill the lake with expensive stuff after he poisoned all the fish.
4069,3710,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,615,Gonna catch me a glow fish.
4074,3710,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,615,I personally prefer live bait for this spot
5175,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,"You're not supposed to target ornates, Dan"
4167,3710,0,13,52,65,1.2,0.05000000000000002,615,This sure beats dumpster diving.
4224,3710,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,615,Interesting lure. So enlighten me.
4263,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,"The expression is “bait and switch”, Phil, not “bait for switch”."
4319,3710,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,615,I'd toss it back but the wife is redecorating.
4321,3710,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,615,"I wanted to get one, but this isn’t the right one."
4446,3710,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,615,"When the guy sold it to me, I thought it was a lite lure, not a light lure!"
4494,3710,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,615,Maybe moths aren't the best bait to use
5180,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,"If the candle flames don't go out when you submerge them, we're in big trouble."
5540,3710,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,615,"Golly, the neighbors told me their house was underwater, but I had no idea!"
5203,3710,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,615,"tried to tell my wife this wasn't a bright idea, but she insisted I hang it myself."

6478,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,Fishing is light today.
6508,3710,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,615,There is light at the end of the rod.
6560,3710,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,615,"I catch my limit, because they like the light."
6570,3710,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,615,I heard flashy lures work best these days
6572,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,Does that work for electric eels?
6573,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,"Good job, you caught a chandelier, now try catching a fish."
6608,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,Things are looking up. Last week I caught an old tire.
6620,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,That bait shop guy is a hell of a salesman.
6639,3710,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,615,"Great! Now when I catch dinner, I can see what I'm eating!"
6450,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,Must be a Trump squid boat.
6657,3710,4,5,56,65,1.2,0.06650621717611764,615,"""Beats me ... Mar a Lago?"
6804,3710,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,615,"Throw it back, you don’t have a fishing lightsense."
6810,3710,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,615,I wonder if it takes LED bulbs.
6841,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,Here's why Epinephelus itajara is a critically endangered species.
6889,3710,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,615,The 'Liberace' — that lure has never failed me yet.
6946,3710,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,615,Live bait...UGH...I though you said light bait
6967,3710,0,13,52,65,1.2,0.05000000000000002,615,"I know they say it takes more skill, but I just can't catch anything using light tackle."
6971,3710,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,615,I think it's a lamprey.
7007,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,"Once I start tying, I just can’t stop."
7024,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,"So that really is a lightening rod, huh."
3437,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,Another catch from Mar-a-Lago! Global warming just keeps on giving.
6797,3710,4,5,56,65,1.2,0.06650621717611764,615,Looks like even Poseidon is switching to LEDs
6448,3710,0,13,52,65,1.2,0.05000000000000002,615,Maybe I should have have just gone antiquing with Rose after all.
6428,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,I don't know if this beats a good day at work.
6414,3710,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,615,"My wife told me to catch a dining room table, but I guess they weren't biting!"
5209,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,"I bought the best bait available at Bed, Bath, & Beyond."
5253,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,Sigh. Another cruise ship too close to our rocks.
5301,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,I must have a lighting rod.
5322,3710,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,615,All this bait has attracted is electric eels and discarded kitchen appliances.
5354,3710,4,5,56,65,1.2,0.06650621717611764,615,Guess where we pulled one of these from in the E.R.
5368,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,"I might not catch anything, but it's at least less messy than worms."
5453,3710,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,615,Looks like you caught a hanging chand.
5576,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,I'm hoping to catch a cabinet member.
5687,3710,0,13,52,65,1.2,0.05000000000000002,615,Wow! . . . Antiques Road Show will be in town next week.

5735,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,Neptune having another bang bang party?
5784,3710,0,13,52,65,1.2,0.05000000000000002,615,Just tell her you spent all day redecorating.
5812,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,Just trying to make the fish feel more at home.
5817,3710,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,615,I'm going to try a bigger lure today
5855,3710,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,615,How the hell is the fire still burning?
5867,3710,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,615,I was hoping for a kitchen sink.
6056,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,Are you trying to hook Liberace?
6175,3710,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,615,You must be fishing for that tuna with good taste.
6228,3710,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,615,"Karen says I spend too much time out here, but I think she’d appreciate this catch."
6241,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,I can’t eat this!
6277,3710,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,615,This is the only way to get fish stories.
6367,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,"The fish sure are rich! Aven, age 7"
6394,3710,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,615,"From how hard it was fighting, I expected at least eight arms."
5181,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,They weren't kidding when they said the Met Opera was a sinking ship.

3382,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,I need you to take a photo to establish provenance.
1032,3710,0,13,52,65,1.2,0.05000000000000002,615,Wheel of Fortune- Before and after puzzle. Fishing Trip the light fantastic.
1040,3710,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,615,"Yikes, Harold, have you considered a more conventional approach?"
1095,3710,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,615,I was hoping for a dinette set.
1137,3710,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,615,This lure's for lobster frittata.
1187,3710,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,615,I heard they're catching em on light tackle.
1193,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,Its catch and release so you can't keep it!
1221,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,I catch a lot of lampreys this way.
1268,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,Forget fishing. I get more strikes bowling and I don't feel half as stupid.
1324,3710,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,615,"Did you really think you’d catch a fish, or was this some new idea of father-son bonding?"
1344,3710,4,5,56,65,1.2,0.06650621717611764,615,The hipster fish are redecorating.
986,3710,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,615,A catch your wife will love.
1486,3710,0,13,52,65,1.2,0.05000000000000002,615,I read that this is the best way to catch an angler fish
1530,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,"You know, I've always been haunted by that 32 light that got away."
1557,3710,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,615,I told you Atlantis was real!
1563,3710,4,5,56,65,1.2,0.06650621717611764,615,I got it in the divorce.
1612,3710,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,615,I didn’t know what was going to happen when I used my flashlight as fishing bait.
1666,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,"I always bring the chandelier, Billy. I call it the ""Liberace Effect"": the warm glow attracts the big ones."
1685,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,I bought this from the Trump Tackle Collection
1692,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,I once met a guy who pulled up a piece of San Quentin.

943,3710,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,615,Liberace cod? Magnificent.
925,3710,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,615,I must have used the wrong bait.
909,3710,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,615,This draws a better grade of fish than the disco ball.
3386,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,"Enough of the bottom feeders, I’m going for the belle of the ball."

109,3710,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,615,I told you this is rich fishing water.
151,3710,4,5,56,65,1.2,0.06650621717611764,615,Yet another phishing scam.
155,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,I'm fishing for fancy feast
165,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,I thought it would work better than a glow worm.
193,3710,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,615,"Chick bait, maybe, but not fish."
203,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,There was a health warning about lead crystal in the water
233,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,I only want the good stuff.

560,3710,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,615,Give the fish a lure and you eat him for a day. Give the fish a chandelier and you eat ‘em for a lifetime.
600,3710,1,11,53,65,1.2,0.0545964214099169,615,"Throw it back, its too light"""
610,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,Back in the day there was a series of commercials about a tuna who wanted to be caught -- I don't know why -- and thought he had to demonstrate good taste to be worthy. I believed those commercials to be pure whimsy until this moment.
664,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,Pretty sure now that the guy at the bait shop thought I said I was going after 'Musketeers' instead of 'muskies.'
721,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,I'd hand it over to Mueller.

789,3710,3,7,55,65,1.2,0.06278779891274812,615,I admit I'm fishing for compliments.
794,3710,2,9,54,65,1.2,0.05883484054145522,615,Is that a chandelier from living room that your wife didn't like?

4486,5311,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,615,You used to just catch fish in Miami.
4247,5311,2,3,45,50,1.14,0.06395151224456967,615,I think this is they call ‘trickle-down economics’ .
4271,5311,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,615,You can't catch a high end meal like that Bill

6490,5311,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,615,Couldn't have done that on Mother's Day?
6621,5311,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,615,I don’t think lighting the candles is gonna make a difference.
6623,5311,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,615,That's a nice chandelure you got there Jim
6660,5311,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,615,I didn't know we were fishing over the Titanic.
6288,5311,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,615,No. Bigger.
6713,5311,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,615,Not the kind of bra I was sitting here thinking about.
6942,5311,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,615,I believed you when you said you could come up with a thousand uses for a chandelier
7068,5311,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,615,Don't worry. I'm a retired electrician and it's a lot lighter than it looks.
6968,5311,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,615,"Call me Ishmael. Electrophorus electricus, my boy, that electric eel has been shocking me for years."
7037,5311,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,615,You said you're an electrician for the mermaid.
7060,5311,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,615,I used the wrong bait
3788,5311,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,615,Mermaids.
6836,5311,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,615,Definitely for a Sotheby’s auction.
6283,5311,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,615,Just cuz they're bass don't mean they ain't got no class.
6282,5311,2,3,45,50,1.14,0.06395151224456967,615,"""Inpressive catch, but it's going to be hell to clean and fillet.'"
6225,5311,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,615,So this is where that Phantom of the Opera themed cruise sank...
5464,5311,2,3,45,50,1.14,0.06395151224456967,615,"I've heard of a chandelier lure, but that is just ridiculous."
5493,5311,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,615,How many pounds do you suppose that is?
5504,5311,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,615,I knew that extra money for caviar bait would pay off.
5554,5311,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,615,The phantom will take that off the hook.
5590,5311,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,615,"No luck, huh? Did you try the candelabra?"
5730,5311,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,615,You have to plug it in if you want to electrocute the fish.
5738,5311,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,615,Hey! I just got a bright idea!

5964,5311,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,615,I didn't know fishing could be so enlightening!
5974,5311,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,615,That's some lure you got there.
5998,5311,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,615,No . . . it's bait.
6069,5311,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,615,"Yes, but only when I’m using light tackle."
6104,5311,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,615,Hoping to snag an Opera fish.
6131,5311,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,615,It takes a light touch.
6190,5311,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,615,The beautification initiative has gone too far.
5269,5311,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,615,Looks like it came from the Titanic.
3767,5311,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,615,It’s a Trump lire. Great for bottom feeders.
124,5311,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,615,This is to help me see where my car keys are at.
3740,5311,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,615,There's no way in hell Luigi. You gotta realize where we're sittin' fishin' and Lady Liberty is lookin' right at us. The Great Mechanic sunk about 700 miles away. Might be worth a few bucks at a pawn shop though.
989,5311,2,3,45,50,1.14,0.06395151224456967,615,Guess we're having a light lunch again.
990,5311,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,615,Do they use it for lighting or decoration?
1016,5311,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,615,"We're redoing the living room, so I'm just fishing for complements."
1087,5311,2,3,45,50,1.14,0.06395151224456967,615,Hmmm.
1124,5311,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,615,Promise you won't report me.
1156,5311,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,615,Bottom feeders won't touch it.
971,5311,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,615,I told you this addition to the house would be a good idea eventually.
1179,5311,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,615,Big Deal!! CHANDELIER!!!!

1749,5311,3,1,46,50,1.14,0.07004371812646434,615,I've heard about these Chand Sharks.
1768,5311,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,615,I hope Sia isn't around.
1786,5311,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,615,It's the only lure I've found that will catch candle fish.
1788,5311,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,615,And I was using my 'Mrs. Potts' lure.
1802,5311,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,615,Wasn't catching anything by tying my own flies.
1727,5311,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,615,Got this lure from my grandpa - they sure don't make 'em like this anymore.
1818,5311,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,615,You better not let the Fish and Game officer catch you using that hook.
866,5311,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,615,That's quite the lure.
748,5311,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,615,An underwater production of Phantom of the Opera.
3748,5311,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,615,"By golly, you've located the Titanic."
92,5311,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,615,I promised my wife I would have the chandelier home by dinner time.
102,5311,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,615,I plan to catch 'em and fry 'em all at once.
121,5311,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,615,This is another one of those benefits of climate change I was talking about.
153,5311,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,615,I guess the Mid-Century population is dwindling.
332,5311,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,615,Must be that expensive bait I’ve been using.
841,5311,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,615,Night fishing is romantic.

452,5311,2,3,45,50,1.14,0.06395151224456967,615,Now it's just a figurative sunk cost.
453,5311,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,615,"Shiny and sparkly, it can't miss."
471,5311,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,615,I'm hoping to catch something classy -- like lobster
517,5311,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,615,Are we trying to catch bass or class?

1942,5311,1,5,44,50,1.14,0.057214241127145085,615,This'll give that angler fish something to think about.
2992,5311,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,615,I'm just looking for a fish with whom I can share the finer things.

3173,5311,2,3,45,50,1.14,0.06395151224456967,615,I'm slowly get rid of stuff from the storage room.
3185,5311,0,7,43,50,1.14,0.04956957592256419,615,"Now I guess fishing will be considered elitist on the East Coast."" ""Actually, it's called angling..."

5805,5713,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,615,Wow! I guess you used chrystal bait?

5208,5713,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,615,Maybe now we can buy a boat.
5057,5713,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,615,Small pond...gotta make sure I get the big fish.

864,5713,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,615,I used to shoot out the lights.
856,5713,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,615,Guess that's what they meant by a steel wiring combo pack.
724,5713,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,615,I couldn't find my tackle box

228,5713,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,615,Guess I need to face the fact that this fishin' hole is done fished out.
223,5713,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,615,I'm fishing for a formal dinner.
170,5713,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,615,Don't laugh. I caught a 10 pound catfish with this rig last fall.
1082,5713,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,615,"I really think there are enough fish in there, that we could both fish at the same time."

1079,5713,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,615,I like a light tackle for electric eels.
1202,5713,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,615,I thought it was a light pull.
3092,5713,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,615,"Oh oh! If I bring this home, my wife will insist on buying a new dining set to match."
3091,5713,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,615,Looks like it'll be a light dinner tonight.
2977,5713,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,615,Must be the flashy lure.
2789,5713,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,615,I guess it’ll just have to be a light lunch
2671,5713,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,615,Watch out. I'll start swinging.
2469,5713,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,615,I told you we'd get a good catch in Orange County!
2383,5713,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,615,Too bad it's under the size limit.
2354,5713,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,615,From the Titanic?
2305,5713,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,615,I told you not to use that expensive bait!
1154,5713,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,615,"And I thought to myself, if you're going to use dynamite to catch fish, why not do it with style?"
2037,5713,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,615,"Son, it's time you learned what the fish in the sea really bite on."
1946,5713,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,615,And then I gave up fly fishing for click bait.
2154,5713,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,615,I started out with a single bulb when I was your age.

1880,5713,0,6,42,48,1.125,0.04824031156174748,615,I don't know... could be tough unhookin' it after I reel one in.
1315,5713,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,615,If we change the bait we might get the whole room!
1386,5713,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,615,I practice catch and release. This is obviously a breeding female.
1266,5713,1,4,43,48,1.125,0.056689086094851654,615,It works pretty good on the upper eastern side of the lake.

375,5818,2,2,45,49,1.1224489795918366,0.06276408873212902,615,I heard this is how they catch the fish in Fancy Feast.
