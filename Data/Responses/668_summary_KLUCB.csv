4828,4061,1,14,65,80,1.2,0.04839186038889943,668,But I'm a mouse and this is a rat maze.
4849,4061,1,14,65,80,1.2,0.04839186038889943,668,This is the last time I’m buying one of these things from IKEA!
4867,4061,1,14,65,80,1.2,0.04839186038889943,668,Ok.  We can make this trap work for us.
4930,4061,1,14,65,80,1.2,0.04839186038889943,668,What this world needs is a better mantrap.
4954,4061,2,12,66,80,1.2,0.05155800469472481,668,These instructions are impossible to understand!
4977,4061,0,16,64,80,1.2,0.045003516037040954,668,Give it back. I know this came with a third piece of cheese.
5007,4061,2,12,66,80,1.2,0.05155800469472481,668,"Ugh, I hate ‘choose your own adventure’."
5013,4061,1,14,65,80,1.2,0.04839186038889943,668,Let's just return it and go look for some cheese.
5026,4061,0,16,64,80,1.2,0.045003516037040954,668,I thought Ikea said it would be easy.
5039,4061,2,12,66,80,1.2,0.05155800469472481,668,We're Norway rats. We need Swedish rats to put this IKEA thing  together.
5042,4061,2,12,66,80,1.2,0.05155800469472481,668,There's a place down the road fully built.
5049,4061,3,10,67,80,1.2,0.05454065955141904,668,"I like to read instructions, not just stare at pictures."

5086,4061,1,14,65,80,1.2,0.04839186038889943,668,Why they name it Minocat?
5143,4061,3,10,67,80,1.2,0.05454065955141904,668,I'm not saying I don't appreciate the vote of confidence. But we should also be getting more cheese.
5169,4061,2,12,66,80,1.2,0.05155800469472481,668,You’ll see - the final product will truly amaze you!

5239,4061,2,12,66,80,1.2,0.05155800469472481,668,"Listen, we got to be careful, the last time I assemble something I had to install it."
5340,4061,1,14,65,80,1.2,0.04839186038889943,668,I got this at Ikea
5385,4061,0,16,64,80,1.2,0.045003516037040954,668,"Dang, the directions are in human!"
5394,4061,2,12,66,80,1.2,0.05155800469472481,668,What if we just keep the cheese in the refrigerator?
5404,4061,1,14,65,80,1.2,0.04839186038889943,668,Since when?
5428,4061,1,14,65,80,1.2,0.04839186038889943,668,Skip the instructions and let's build a cat and mouse game.
5430,4061,1,14,65,80,1.2,0.04839186038889943,668,Oh No! It’s in Swedish.
5432,4061,2,12,66,80,1.2,0.05155800469472481,668,These instructions are so complicated you'd think we were assembling a maze.
2814,4061,1,14,65,80,1.2,0.04839186038889943,668,This will be amazing when it's done!
1500,4061,3,10,67,80,1.2,0.05454065955141904,668,"I hear the other mice's maze just electrocutes them.""
""Jealous."
2802,4061,2,12,66,80,1.2,0.05155800469472481,668,Remember last time we had two pieces left over.
843,4061,2,12,66,80,1.2,0.05155800469472481,668,"But look at it this way - when we're done, we'll be the fastest solvers in the whole damn lab!"
859,4061,1,14,65,80,1.2,0.04839186038889943,668,"Squeak, these are amazing plans."
875,4061,1,14,65,80,1.2,0.04839186038889943,668,"They can't figure it out, so they're leaving it to us."

935,4061,2,12,66,80,1.2,0.05155800469472481,668,"Yep, there's no way out - just the standard IKEA store plan."
1007,4061,1,14,65,80,1.2,0.04839186038889943,668,"I don’t know, Harold.  This flat-pack home looks a lot like a trap to me."

1248,4061,1,14,65,80,1.2,0.04839186038889943,668,I told you cheese wasn't included.
1262,4061,4,8,68,80,1.2,0.05736845161328941,668,You'd have to be a scientist to understand this.

780,4061,2,12,66,80,1.2,0.05155800469472481,668,It was easier before IKEA took over these experiments.
1480,4061,1,14,65,80,1.2,0.04839186038889943,668,The instructions are in IKEA. We’re good.

198,4061,2,12,66,80,1.2,0.05155800469472481,668,We're missing a part. Where the heck is the cheese?
220,4061,1,14,65,80,1.2,0.04839186038889943,668,The real challenge is finding somewhere to put the cheese.
263,4061,3,10,67,80,1.2,0.05454065955141904,668,I hate these IKEA instructions.
321,4061,2,12,66,80,1.2,0.05155800469472481,668,It says the cheese isn't included
323,4061,2,12,66,80,1.2,0.05155800469472481,668,The nice thing about Ikea instructions is that pictures make it easy.
382,4061,1,14,65,80,1.2,0.04839186038889943,668,These plans seem pretty easy to follow.
437,4061,2,12,66,80,1.2,0.05155800469472481,668,Jokes on them... I already ate the cheese!
502,4061,0,16,64,80,1.2,0.045003516037040954,668,So the good news is that it’s not a better mousetrap!
503,4061,1,14,65,80,1.2,0.04839186038889943,668,It says there's a deconstructed cheese sandwich in there someplace.
529,4061,1,14,65,80,1.2,0.04839186038889943,668,"You got this maze from IKEA,right?"
534,4061,2,12,66,80,1.2,0.05155800469472481,668,They don’t make ‘em like they used to.

587,4061,1,14,65,80,1.2,0.04839186038889943,668,What possessed you to buy this at IKEA?
640,4061,2,12,66,80,1.2,0.05155800469472481,668,Do you think Ikea tells the humans we can finish any of these in less than an hour?
681,4061,1,14,65,80,1.2,0.04839186038889943,668,"Before you begin, it says to count the pieces. Rats!"
691,4061,2,12,66,80,1.2,0.05155800469472481,668,There must be an easier way to get some cheese.
731,4061,1,14,65,80,1.2,0.04839186038889943,668,I’m thinking an open plan for better flow.
1509,4061,0,16,64,80,1.2,0.045003516037040954,668,IKEA is truly diabolical.
215,4061,1,14,65,80,1.2,0.04839186038889943,668,"What? No, this is totally different. It's a 'mus labyrint' accent piece."

2219,4061,1,14,65,80,1.2,0.04839186038889943,668,Why did you go to Ikea?
2233,4061,2,12,66,80,1.2,0.05155800469472481,668,"How hard can this IKEA maze be? We have the instructions, the tools and all the parts."

2381,4061,1,14,65,80,1.2,0.04839186038889943,668,I really hope this doesn't put any tension in our relationship.
2391,4061,2,12,66,80,1.2,0.05155800469472481,668,You’re telling me that the cheese isn’t included?

2426,4061,2,12,66,80,1.2,0.05155800469472481,668,I told you we should have just stopped for meatballs.
2502,4061,1,14,65,80,1.2,0.04839186038889943,668,It looks a little easier than the Skinner box.

2668,4061,2,12,66,80,1.2,0.05155800469472481,668,I told you not to make it look so easy running the maze!

2684,4061,2,12,66,80,1.2,0.05155800469472481,668,I liked it better when they came preassembled.

1409,5468,0,7,49,56,1.125,0.04459412925079223,668,They call it IKEA. Supposedly the reward is finishing it without killing each other.
2904,5468,1,5,50,56,1.125,0.05136133772583239,668,It is not a mouse trap. It is a new bedroom set.
1360,5468,0,7,49,56,1.125,0.04459412925079223,668,This breaks up some couples.

854,5468,0,7,49,56,1.125,0.04459412925079223,668,"Yes, I know we're trying to train them for the lab, but I still say it's too complicated for the kids."
824,5468,0,7,49,56,1.125,0.04459412925079223,668,Poor dumb humans will never figure out this one!
774,5468,0,7,49,56,1.125,0.04459412925079223,668,I got it from ikea not like the last one from acme

637,5468,0,7,49,56,1.125,0.04459412925079223,668,I say we should buy some SqueeKEA stock.
611,5468,2,3,51,56,1.125,0.057335309036732875,668,It's a mazing from Ikea

1520,5468,1,5,50,56,1.125,0.05136133772583239,668,It used to be so simple..... just walk in the door and follow your nose.
1012,5468,1,5,50,56,1.125,0.05136133772583239,668,The maze ends at a small portion of food.  I recommend following the human home.
1617,5468,1,5,50,56,1.125,0.05136133772583239,668,"Hey, do you remember those humans who kept cursing about something called IKEA?"
2866,5468,2,3,51,56,1.125,0.057335309036732875,668,"No, I'm not a racist, all I'm saying is if  were blue I could read it."
1565,5468,1,5,50,56,1.125,0.05136133772583239,668,"Oh crud, we forgot the cheese!"
