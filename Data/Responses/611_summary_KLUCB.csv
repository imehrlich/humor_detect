3607,4142,1,15,69,85,1.2,0.04674263524428026,611,I even keep off the statues but people in the park still don't feed me.
3663,4142,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,611,"So, you said this worked for Grant, right?"
3781,4142,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,611,Why? It's a long tale.
3844,4142,1,15,69,85,1.2,0.04674263524428026,611,"If a spider can steal their hearts, this should be a walk in the park."
3949,4142,0,17,68,85,1.2,0.04364357804719847,611,So much faster than my subway commute.
3965,4142,0,17,68,85,1.2,0.04364357804719847,611,I don't see the resemblance.
3980,4142,0,17,68,85,1.2,0.04364357804719847,611,I am going down the shady side first.
3982,4142,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,611,I just don't want to lie in my death bed regretting that I never tried to fly.
4045,4142,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,611,Off I go to the belfry!
5290,4142,1,15,69,85,1.2,0.04674263524428026,611,Yours might go SPLAT but mine will go RAT-AT-AT-AT!’
4168,4142,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,611,Flying away is the only way to win the rat race
3598,4142,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,611,"All right Pigeon, to the rat cave!"
5317,4142,1,15,69,85,1.2,0.04674263524428026,611,If I can pull this off I’ll get my own webcam
5530,4142,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,611,What are you looking at? You have some nerve calling yourself a flying rat!
5428,4142,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,611,Move over pigeon! Batman has nothing on BATRAT!
6450,4142,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,611,I'm just preparing for when they bring back the El.
6499,4142,1,15,69,85,1.2,0.04674263524428026,611,"If I hear ‘rat with wings’ one more time, I’m going to scream."
6608,4142,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,611,I'm off to the Rat Cave.
6609,4142,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,611,You still won't be able to fly!
6692,4142,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,611,Because I'm the hero Gotham deserves right now.
6708,4142,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,611,I want to escape the dark hole and soar to the sun.
6744,4142,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,611,Race you to the statue
6768,4142,1,15,69,85,1.2,0.04674263524428026,611,"Ok, so I'm a rat with wings. So what?"
6771,4142,0,17,68,85,1.2,0.04364357804719847,611,"So...I just master this, then there's no more lugging subway pizza around?"
6863,4142,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,611,Why are you called a flying rat when I'm the real thing?
7161,4142,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,611,You remember? Dinner at 7. Don't be late...
7167,4142,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,611,Creatures of the sewer? Ha! Enough of being pigeonholed!
7285,4142,0,17,68,85,1.2,0.04364357804719847,611,Be honest. Am I just plain batty to think I can fly?
7372,4142,0,17,68,85,1.2,0.04364357804719847,611,"Sorry, Pidg... a Bat-Rat’s gotta do what a Bat-Rat’s gotta do!"
7448,4142,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,611,You think solving a maze is amazing? Watch this!
7496,4142,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,611,Pre-op?
7504,4142,0,17,68,85,1.2,0.04364357804719847,611,"They ain't callin' me ""Pizza Rat"" anymore!"
7508,4142,0,17,68,85,1.2,0.04364357804719847,611,And Icarus also had an ozone layer.
7593,4142,1,15,69,85,1.2,0.04674263524428026,611,"Brother, whether my next step does lead to seeming failure - me a furry pulp on the street below, or superficial triumph - the two of us together, soiling some loser’s head, we have already won. The world will know our wit and will."
7595,4142,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,611,"""Of course I can fly, I'm a trans-bat."
7628,4142,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,611,This is REALLY gonna freak 'em out.
7689,4142,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,611,"Au contraire, I'll be the more adored because I poop in pellets."
6881,4142,0,17,68,85,1.2,0.04364357804719847,611,The rat race is so competitive these days.
6437,4142,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,611,"Step aside, Pizza Rat!"
6401,4142,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,611,It's pronounced Squab.
6387,4142,0,17,68,85,1.2,0.04364357804719847,611,They say it's made of green cheese.
6364,4142,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,611,I'm telling you I've got flying down pat. The landing in not as sure.
5429,4142,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,611,"So if this works out, do you wanna grab a coffee later?"
5517,4142,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,611,I always dreamed of being a flying squirrel.
5542,4142,1,15,69,85,1.2,0.04674263524428026,611,The lemmings made me do it.
5631,4142,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,611,"For too long have you stolen the spotlight, Carl! Now it's my turn!"
5699,4142,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,611,"And for my next trick, I'll fly all the way back down!"
2978,4142,1,15,69,85,1.2,0.04674263524428026,611,Do you think there's a god?
5750,4142,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,611,Hey Batrat you do know I'm not a Robin.
5810,4142,1,15,69,85,1.2,0.04674263524428026,611,At least you had time to put on your makeup.
5854,4142,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,611,What's the best make of car to crap on?
6954,4142,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,611,"Dude, you're taking this way too literally."
5951,4142,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,611,I couldn't think of a caption for last week's contest! So I'm going to end it all in style!
5358,4142,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,611,This guy has never heard of Darwin’s Theory.

6053,4142,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,611,"Alright, alright. I'm not a bird. Just don't rat me out."
6101,4142,1,15,69,85,1.2,0.04674263524428026,611,"I'm more than just ""pizza rat"" dammit!"

6131,4142,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,611,My Mom always told me I could be a rat with wings.
6144,4142,0,17,68,85,1.2,0.04364357804719847,611,They'll call me Ratman. I'll be HUGE!
6174,4142,1,15,69,85,1.2,0.04674263524428026,611,"And they said flying was ""ir-rat-tional"""
6189,4142,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,611,I bought this on Etsy.

6312,4142,1,15,69,85,1.2,0.04674263524428026,611,Residents on the 17 floor paid to have these made for me.
7123,4142,0,17,68,85,1.2,0.04364357804719847,611,"OK, I guess I'm big enough to admit that ‘rat with wings’ doesn't fully speak to your capabilities.”"
6013,4142,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,611,I’m telling you I was an Eagle in my last life.

754,4142,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,611,"I just hold on and the wings work on their own, right?"
836,4142,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,611,"If this goes according to plan, your rebranding will be complete!"
901,4142,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,611,"They call you ""flying rats"". Well it's time for authenticity!"
958,4142,1,15,69,85,1.2,0.04674263524428026,611,It just occurred to me that the money-back guarantee you offer if I'm not satisfied with your flying lessons isn't reassuring.
964,4142,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,611,"Look, Templeton -- you don't have to do this! It's just something people say!"
