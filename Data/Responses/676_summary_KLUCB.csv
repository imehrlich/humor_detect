2580,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,Fear not... It tastes like chicken!
2528,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,"Don’t worry, hon, it’s completely sustainable."
2523,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,"Some men have always risen to the challenge, no matter how big!"
2521,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,No!  It will not be done in an hour.
2520,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,Get me the meat thermometer!
2496,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,"These mastodon shanks sure  take a long time to roast,
but they are worth it !"
2491,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,We are going to need a bigger grill if you want to eat this by breakfast!
2387,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,"Relax, its a slow roaster."
2361,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,The white meat is gonna take a little longer.
2285,2773,6,9,81,96,1.21875,0.05580968011677582,676,"I said, they were out of wings!"
2279,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,"Be patient, Sweetbeart. Krug says it makes the meat taste real good"
2619,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,It will be a while before dinner is ready.
2615,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,Daddy knows what he's doing. Just have a little snack or something.
3251,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,"If you think this is big, wait til you see the buffalo wings that the Smiths are bringing to our BBQ tonight!"
3359,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,"Sorry, I struck out on the first two options. Popeye's was sold out and it's Sunday."
2199,2773,5,11,80,96,1.21875,0.053809127005767406,676,What--do you want it raw?
4526,2773,4,13,79,96,1.21875,0.05173126620824946,676,I got it at the Paleozoic fair.
4518,2773,1,19,76,96,1.21875,0.044924705526766306,676,I'm waiting for someone to invent barbecue sauce.
4445,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,Can our Company evolve a little later?
4438,2773,4,13,79,96,1.21875,0.05173126620824946,676,"If y'all are hungry too, there's another out back."
4415,2773,1,19,76,96,1.21875,0.044924705526766306,676,I don't know what a drum is but they said this is its stick.
4348,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,"I know I know, don't you think I'd also rather have a big salad by now?"
4227,2773,1,19,76,96,1.21875,0.044924705526766306,676,It's Homo luzonensis-licking good.
4207,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,It looks like we're going to need a bigger grill!
4177,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,"Honey, you know bigger is better"
4157,2773,4,13,79,96,1.21875,0.05173126620824946,676,So how do you like it? Medium extinct?
4134,2773,4,13,79,96,1.21875,0.05173126620824946,676,Did too!
4129,2773,5,11,80,96,1.21875,0.053809127005767406,676,The barbecue delivered from the future by Amazon's time machine is waaay too small.
4075,2773,4,13,79,96,1.21875,0.05173126620824946,676,Stop whining—you can bet that its chicks are relishing uncle Bob.
4018,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,What do you mean we're out of BBQ sauce?
3855,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,Now you're smoking!
3851,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,"''I don't know what it is, honey. Why don't you just cook mammoth with fire?''"
3364,2773,4,13,79,96,1.21875,0.05173126620824946,676,How would you like your mastodon?
3400,2773,4,13,79,96,1.21875,0.05173126620824946,676,"(sigh)...more carbon emissions.  I guess no more Ice Age fun for you, kids!"
3406,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,Next time kill a smaller one!
3413,2773,0,21,75,96,1.21875,0.04241380578364351,676,"If I had a bigger grill, this would have been done hours ago!"
3432,2773,4,13,79,96,1.21875,0.05173126620824946,676,"Oh, I got the grill from 'Amazon Future Fulfillment,' and could you believe this is the largest size they sell?  Like, what do they grill on these things? Sure glad we're not living in the future."
3457,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,See if you can find my Bluetooth temperature probe
3238,2773,4,13,79,96,1.21875,0.05173126620824946,676,These damn dinosaur drumsticks take forever to cook.
3531,2773,1,19,76,96,1.21875,0.044924705526766306,676,Is that a Weber Grille?
3555,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,"Whaddya want from me, I invented fire, not the 48” Weber."
3570,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,"You know, there are people freezing in the Arctics who would love to have that, so don't be so wasteful."
3594,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,"George, did you kill a dinosaur for our dinner? What are we, cavemen? We eat proper food."
3641,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,"No, we are not inviting anyone else for dinner"""
3726,2773,1,19,76,96,1.21875,0.044924705526766306,676,It’s still frozen in the middle.
3822,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,"Yeah, I know I should have gotten a bigger BBQ!"
3543,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,Sorry no white meat option today.
2122,2773,1,19,76,96,1.21875,0.044924705526766306,676,You’ll be even more sorry you didn’t let me get the bigger grill of we get salmonella poisoning.
2333,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,I found it at the dump.
2079,2773,4,13,79,96,1.21875,0.05173126620824946,676,"Well, why don't you go ahead and invent the rotisserie, then?"
802,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,"Maybe now you understand why I wanted a barrel smoker for Father's Day."""
781,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,It's all dark meat.
770,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,I'm crisping the skin.
749,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,Roll Tide. Roll Tide. For some reason that's all that comes to mind.
727,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,I wish we had enough for your parent's - next weekend dear!
707,2773,4,13,79,96,1.21875,0.05173126620824946,676,Does anyone have Brontosaurus allergies?
687,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,What?  You don't like dark meat.
678,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,A week from now you’re going to thank me for grilling low and slow.
658,2773,0,21,75,96,1.21875,0.04241380578364351,676,I told you that Sunday is cave paintings and wings with the guys.
632,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,"It's free range, no one can keep them in."
528,2773,1,19,76,96,1.21875,0.044924705526766306,676,"Don’t worry, it tastes just like pterodactyl."
514,2773,5,11,80,96,1.21875,0.053809127005767406,676,Steroid-free was not available!
502,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,It's organic and free range. No antibiotics were added.
477,2773,5,11,80,96,1.21875,0.053809127005767406,676,The inventor of the rotisserie must be spinning in his grave.
945,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,But were're vegans !
446,2773,1,19,76,96,1.21875,0.044924705526766306,676,Well go out and gather something then!
392,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,"All we need now, is to invent fire"
336,2773,1,19,76,96,1.21875,0.044924705526766306,676,I don't want to hear any complaints about leftovers.
320,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,It’ll be done when it’s done!
269,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,"The kids won't eat it unless it's well done."""
265,2773,1,19,76,96,1.21875,0.044924705526766306,676,Do you mind if it’s mostly still raw?
263,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,I'll know it's done when you get the meat thermometer.
180,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,Coming right up - meat for three and one teething bone.
127,2773,1,19,76,96,1.21875,0.044924705526766306,676,I know it’s their bedtime but the internal temperature is still only 130°!
124,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,"Fire is totally paleolithic, Gwen.  Trust me, this slow roast thing will catch on.  That bigger cave you wanted?  It's coming."
120,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,I'm giving it some time.
64,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,"Honey, we are vegetarians!"
61,2773,1,19,76,96,1.21875,0.044924705526766306,676,"Don't worry, it tastes just like chicken!"
49,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,Oh so now you tell me you’re a vegan!”
24,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,Me shop CostCo
426,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,You should have put it on this morning instead of fooling around with your cave paints!
985,2773,4,13,79,96,1.21875,0.05173126620824946,676,"I TOLD you that we should get a bigger grill during the Labor Day sale, but nooooooo ...."
950,2773,4,13,79,96,1.21875,0.05173126620824946,676,Just a few more minutes....
1069,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,Who's the one who's complaining about not liking dark meat?
1715,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,I have to turn it slowly.
1754,2773,0,21,75,96,1.21875,0.04241380578364351,676,Just my luck. Here comes my vegan mother-inlaw.
1758,2773,1,19,76,96,1.21875,0.044924705526766306,676,I hear it tastes like chicken.
1785,2773,5,11,80,96,1.21875,0.053809127005767406,676,No! There isn't any #%@# white meat!
1833,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,Just tell them the dinosaur ran away...
1846,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,"OK, call the neighbors.  This’ll  be done in half an hour , then we’ll warm up the gravy while I carve."
1037,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,"Well done is going to take a wile, since you insisted to get the grill on Amazon!"
1864,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,"Dear, the kids are asking me if this means you are going back on your promise to become a vegan."
1912,2773,1,19,76,96,1.21875,0.044924705526766306,676,"If you cook the whole mastodon at once, the breast meat gets dry."
1947,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,It's on now because the dark meat takes longer.
2080,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,Might be a while . . .
2009,2773,1,19,76,96,1.21875,0.044924705526766306,676,It should be ready by the Neolithic.
2019,2773,4,13,79,96,1.21875,0.05173126620824946,676,"Um, it's been, like, 8 weeks.Can you go out and get something for us to eat while you finish cooking that thing?"
2032,2773,1,19,76,96,1.21875,0.044924705526766306,676,I told you there was an upside to G.M.O.'s.
1892,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,Be patient. The Rex's front leg would have cooked faster but this part has the most meat.
1646,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,You wanted us to eat Paleo...
1684,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,Once the moon goes down we’ll continue to time it on the sundial.
1483,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,You won't be complaining when it's done.
1085,2773,1,19,76,96,1.21875,0.044924705526766306,676,Why is dinner taking so long? First I had to invent the spatula ...bitch!
1158,2773,1,19,76,96,1.21875,0.044924705526766306,676,You'll appreciate the Low & Slow method... sometime tomorrow.
1249,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,So I see Goodyear bought out Tysons.
1298,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,I already told you—the Mastadon was sold out.
1628,2773,3,15,78,96,1.21875,0.04956637628367376,676,"Quit complaining, the white meat wasn’t on sale."
1328,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,"This time turn it over, brontosauris is disgusting rare."
1322,2773,4,13,79,96,1.21875,0.05173126620824946,676,I think it's still good.. it's only 60 million years old.
1340,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,I think it needs a couple more hours until I turn it again.
1378,2773,1,19,76,96,1.21875,0.044924705526766306,676,Great. A high protein diet is sure to stink up the cave.
1417,2773,2,17,77,96,1.21875,0.04730250957698441,676,Look! Be patient! Someday this'll be veggieburgers.
1420,2773,0,21,75,96,1.21875,0.04241380578364351,676,"Well too bad, I already called dibs on the drumstick."
