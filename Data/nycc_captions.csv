I hope it doesn't clash with the furniture.
Feminism. Crushing every ounce of pride this man had since marriage.
See you later crocodile indeed!
Alright, what did you do with the dog?
Martha, I think something is wrong with the dog.
'Wipe that defenseless animal-eating grin off your face!'
Did you hear that, Stan? I said I'm leaving you, and I'm taking our accountant with me.
When I said 'Later, gator,' I did not mean you could stay out this late.
Hold it there for a second Gary, let me get the towel to wipe your feet.
That reminds me, I could use a new pair of shoes.
GOT SHOES?
What's that ticking sound?
Where's my dog?
Honey, I know what happened to the dog now.
Well, I'll be. Didn't I release you in Florida last year?
Phew, I thought it was a Jehovah's Witness
How was your prey?
We're here for the negotiation, and I have to warn you, one of us isn't flexible.
You're supposed to be using the alley door!
Didn't I say I'd see you later, alligator?
We need to work on our definition of 'later'.
You'll be the pet, since you ate my cat.
You're not my Fido!
You look like the caiman that swallowed the cat.
This could end with crocodile tears.
I wouldn't really consider that a Watergate.
These aren't the shoes you are looking for.
I told you I'd see you later.
Did you do your business!
The neighbor called. He says his muskrat is missing.
I thought I said, See you later.
If you're looking for the Puss 'N' Boots, it's in the kitchen.
Where were you? The neighbors have been worried sick about their pets.
Phyllis, you're never going to believe what the cat brought home this time.
This doesn't look good for the dog.
Where have you been? The whole neighborhood has been worried sick wondering where you were.
What have you done with Dr. Millmoss?
Dog gone!
I take it you won't be negotiating any further?
I see you finally learned to use the crocadoor.
Ma, you gotta stop taxing people.
That was an awfully quick trip out to do potty.
Where's Fluffy?
Where's the newspaper?
I told you I'm a Catholic!
Bring a man to work day
Just give the neighbors time to get use to you.
Don't start with the tears.
One more Amber Alert and you're on a leash!
It's been more than a while.
Come on Buddy, that costume is a crock.
What you need is a good stiff drink.
Not again! What poor creature have you caught to show me this time?
What have you done with Fifi?
Another walk of shame?
Wanna wrestle?
I should have gotten the boots.
Sir fluffles! Did you burry my glasses again?
'Where were you last night? You smell like a sewer.'
Bad alligator! You've been out with that crocodile again, haven't you!
Do you want to talk about the dog that just went out this door?
I just hope you made friends with Fido next door!
Wally, now tell the truth, why did Fifi stop barking?
You know you're supposed to let Crusty in first.
You have to stop losing your collar.
Look what the cat dragged in.

How much bliss do you need?,512
"No, I don't want a magic carpet ride.",512
"What an honor to be Bloomberg's pallbearer, right?",513
Just sharing the workload,513
I didn't think this is what you meant by file sharing...,513
I still say he wanted a three piece suit.,513
Now do you grasp what the PM meant by 'three ministers with portfolio'?,513
Sometimes I think the sharing economy has gone too far.,514
And you said long form was dead.,514
Damn these low emission vehicles!,514
We'll rock till you drop.,514
"If they catch us we're gonna be breakin' rocks, not breakin' rockers.",514
"Go ahead and shoot, we're all carrying cap guns.",515
We go through this every Saturday at bath time,515
The voices in my head are screaming ' Here comes that train again ! ',515
I lost my train of thought.,515
"Now that you're comfortable with planes and buses, let's try to attack your next phobia.",515
You sound like Chicken Little.,516
Ever have one of those days?,516
"Wait a second, I can't remember if we're covered under Medicare part A, GG, or D train!!",516
I certainly don't know what could be worse than the construction dust?,516
And then it hit me...,516
"So I told her, 'Come on babe, live every moment like it's your last.'",517
A concrete metaphor comes to mind....,517
This place attracts a lot of movers and shakers.,517

You had me at Halo.,526
Don't you think it is a bit stupid to watch a contest between an elephant and a donkey?,531
It's turned off. That's your reflection.,531
Wide-screen... I just don't see the appeal.,531
Aren't these reality shows on Wild Kingdom great!,531
There's nothing good on TV--wanna' neck?,531
"My methods are Jungian. Sometimes a bar of soap *is* just a bar of soap, you know...",591
Some of my patients find the loofah less threatening.,591
It'll keep you Jung.,591
I hope you don't mind. My couch is brand new.,591
Immersion therapy washes away the guilt ... and exfoliates as it cleans.,591
"I know, but you had to spend twenty minutes filling the tub.",591

The answer to number seven? I can’t even turn this thing on.,592
"Back to work birds, and enough with the wisequacks!",592
"Him? He's a pwoblem duck, stwessed out and weady to quack.",592
I'm only in it for the bread.,592

The rats wouldn't perform without a mouse.,592
The experiment was successful; all the ducks are in a row.,592
"When I snap my fingers, you will go home, eat breadcrumbs and crap all over the park.",592
I’m surprised. I really thought they would fly through this training.,592
A little redundant don't you think? You have all your ducks in a row and online.,592
"I can't explain this, maybe we will find a reasonable explanation in next week's New Yorker.",592
They wanted more accurate data on fly-over states.,592
That rebel in the third row? Let’s just eat him.,592
This might be the reason it always autocorrects to 'ducking',592
Its nice that they got us new computers. But these are neither web nor wing friendly.,592
And these are the exchange students from the University of Oregon.,592
We're trying to teach them the hunt and peck method.,592
"They're great tweeters, but hard on the touch screens.",592
"Okay class, Miss Givens will now walk you through using Google Maps to plan flights south.",592
Ummm…I suspect the directive wasn’t “quack the code”.,592
Haven't you ever seen an IT department before?,592
Shouldn't we be facing south for the winter semester?,592
Isn't this experiment supposed to be done with monkeys?,592
"Check it out, everyone is migrating to this new operating system!",592
I think they're all tweeting.,592
I just googled Snopes and both of these doctors are quacks.,592
I'm not sure you are the right fit for a job here at Twitter.,592
They’ve agreed on Duck Soup instead of Hamlet,592
It’s a waste of time. They’re all lame ducks.,592
"Well I'm not sure Quacks will replace Tweets, but it's an improvement over the Oink Campaign last month, and I do like their enthusiasm.",592
Let’s see if the unflavored keypads hold up any better.,592
Don't they know we can't type?,592
"Don't tell her husband about our time in the bathtub, okay!?!",592
"No, dummy. It's 'too be or not too be.'",592
I don`t think anyone ever asked them 'why' before.,592
"If it weren't double blind, you'ld already know which one is a duck.",592
It's not so much what she said as how she said it.,593
"No, my wife served the papers personally.",593
I'm pretty sure it's a final notice,593
"...oh, and there's a note from your mother.",593
‘Sharply worded’ would describe it.,593
"Actually, I would like to shoot the messenger.",593
"Hi honey, we just received the new Republican tax plan.",593
"Well, it doesn't feel like a metaphor.",593
"Yes, I am painfully aware of your terms and conditions.",593
"What I had actually said was ""Take a stab at it and get back to me""",593
I have reason to believe that my wife found our love letters.,593
At least she didn’t use bullet points.,593
"And I said, ""Divorce papers? Why not just stick a knife in my back?""",593
"To her credit, she did leave a note.",593
I'd like to switch to paperless statements.,593
Turns out they CAN pin it on me,593
"The stress is bearable, it's the paperwork that's killing me.",593
I think we can rule out reconciliation.,593
I've just received some painful news.,593
"I'm sorry, but Emma and I won't be able to make it to your murder mystery party. Clever invitation, by the way.",593
She knows.,593
My wife served the papers herself.,593
"No, I can't sit back and relax.",593
I got your text but I’m having trouble with the attachment.,593
"I wouldn't say it went well, but she did sign the divorce papers.",593
Remember when we thought there couldn't be anything worse than his tweets.,593
All I can say is that I did not see this coming.,593
"No, I haven't read it but I get the point.",593
I think the worst news is behind me.,593
"I can’t read it, but I got the message.",593
"No, I haven't read it yet, but I get the point.",593
"Yes, well I'm afraid I'm not in any position to read the fine print just now.",593
I remember them from last year. They must be perennials.,594
"Relax, they're just DRESSED like lumberjacks.",594
I love the fall when all their shirts turn plaid.,594
"Honestly? He's like, ten rings too old for her.",594
They've been in love since 1992. I know. Their initials are carved in my ass.,594
I just love watching them turn plaid in the fall.,594
Could I interest you in a treesome?,594
"You think that's weird, you should watch them pollinate.",594
"Look, Kevin, we're in a Cialis commercial!",594
"... And then their hair begins to lose its color, eventually falling off ...",594
There was a time when a beard and a checkered shirt would have made me nervous,594
"Surprise, surprise. The new manager is a fat white guy with no pants.",595
I can already tell he won't last.,595
He's not as bad as the last manager. That one was abominable.,595
They didn't say who...they just said one of us won't be here in the spring...,595
"It's not you, he's frosty to everyone.",595
I told him if he can't find his size to just wait a few minutes.,595
Either the constant staring stops or I'm cranking up the thermostat.,595
I hear he had a meltdown after the holidays last year,595
He's the very definition of seasonal help.,595
"If he asks you if you want to see his other carrot, just say no.",595
I think you misunderstood when I said to hire seasonal help.,595
He insists it's all water weight.,595
They set the temperature for just ONE employee while the rest of us freeze to death.,595
So he calls me into his office and when I get there he's wearing nothing but a scarf and a top hat,595
I guess the hiring freeze has officially started.,595
"He's fun, sure, but he won't last.",595
"If I wanted a boss with no pants, I'd have stayed in Hollywood.",595
"C’mon, live a little.",596
"C’mon, live a little.",596
"No, thanks. I'm just here to kill time.",596
Just one. I have to get up in the morning and you don't.,596
Last call? You have no idea.,596
Here's to you and taxes.,596
"Actually, I did leave my bag unattended for a few minutes. Why?",597
"Oh, we're not traveling. Our new health plan only covers X-rays done by TSA screening.",597
I’m allowed one suitcase and two personal items,597
I checked the fine print. There’s no fee for emotional baggage.,597
"So, while I was in Rome, I picked up a little Italian",597
This airline always loses my luggage. This time I'm counting on it.,597
He’s used to living out of a suitcase.,597
"If they lose him, I get $750.",597
I packed in a hurry this morning and just grabbed whatever was lying on the bed.,597
You should see how excited he gets when I pick him up at baggage claim.,597
I can't believe my baggage fit in my luggage.,597
He actually gets more legroom in there.,597
He says there's more legroom than in coach.,597
"I'm checking it to Chicago, Me, I'm going to Bermuda.",597
They think we're going on a trip but actually I'm taking them to be fixed.,597
Ted thought this girls' trip was a great idea. He even packed for me.,597
They settle down once they're in the overhead.,597
"Actually, they're both rescues.",597
I’m just happy to be away from my clingy boyfriend and his obnoxious dog.,597
I'm the fitness guru. The wisdom guru is one mountain over.,598
When I retired from Google they let me keep my chair.,598
It's for my back. You have two more questions.,598
"No, but I can show you the path to a tighter butt.",598
"Before I settled here, I bounced around a lot.",598
It turns out that inner peace is 95% core strength.,598
Enlightenment? I'm just trying to achieve alignment.,598
"The keys to a long life are balance and color, but mostly staying away from the edge.",598
"You only get one question and you ask, ""What's that?""!",598
I think there's a misunderstanding. I'm the Bally Lama.,598
I dreamt last night that some day judges might just require a small plastic bracelet,599
They’re known for their unconditional love.,599
"It's called a ""pet.""",599
I know he's extinct. Try telling him that.,599
Do you guys remember the code for the alarm?,599
I'm considered a flight risk.,599
Cave arrest isn't as comfy as I thought it would be,599
"I don't think this ""pet"" thing will ever catch on.",599
"Sure it hurts, but that’s fashion.",599
I was hoping for more of an emotional attachment.,599
Only if I think about it.,599
I parked in a toe-away zone.,599
He's very clingy.,599
He's very attached.,599
we all seem to have one eye,599
My security system has a few glitches.,599
I couldn't afford a fitbit.,599
Mental note. Don’t say “bite me”to a literalsaurus.,599
My wife got a matching bracelet.,599
Frankly he hasn't grasped the concept of 'heel' yet.,599
I can't wait until they invent a leash.,599
He's still teething. He'll evolve out of it.,599
These new ankle monitors are barely noticeable,599
Some extictions can't come soon enough.,599
"Nothing much, what's up with you two?",599
He's been extinct for 65 million years so I'm just as surprised to see him as you are.,599
"The wife wanted a dog, but those won’t be domesticated for another 3,000 years.",599
"No, go without me I shouldn't ignore this gnawing feeling.",599
The teething is killing me.,599
"I brought him home to eat, but I think he misunderstood.",599
It was a lot cuter as a puppy,599
He's been clingy ever since that asteroid last week.,599
The fines don’t even cover feeding the ankle monitor...,599
I didn't mind so much when he was smaller.,599
Right now we're both trying the Paleo thing.,599
Mission accomplished. We will report that this planet's inhabitants are friendly and playful.,600
"When I said abduct the dog, I meant President Trump...",600
"What is boy? A fire down by the old Jetson's house?""",600
Did you remember to take him out before we left?,600
"He agrees to a rectal probe, but only if we use our noses.",600
"My research on tail movements suggests he has to “go,” but I haven’t been able to determine what that means...",600
These earthlings are more intelligent than I thought they’d be.,600
"Tap...tap, tap. What does the code book say?",600
Thank goodness there's at least SOME intelligent life down there.,600
"I just said ""come"" and he came.",600
He looks too intelligent to account for what's going on down there.,600
He says he has business to do on earth.,600
I thought you were a cat person.,600
"I said beam up Scotty, not Spotty!",600
Now remember your mission: go infiltrate a human family and report back.,600
Did you bring your vaccination records with you?,600
"That’s right. Dog-light years are seven times longer, too.",600
These earth creatures are the most lovable and loyal species we've found in the universe.,600
It followed me home. Can I keep him?,600
They seem to have more leadership qualities than the other species.,600
Those beings I see you leading around must be an inferior species?,600
So you are saying if we offer belly rubs and squeaky toys we could take over the world?,600
"We've been monitoring Twitter so there'll be no, ""Take me to your leader.""",600
It’s their leader.,600
"Explain how your species has enslaved the humans, and we shall provide a treat.",600
"He says he has a wide-ranging interest in medieval and renaissance literature, but all he gets on earth is ""go fetch.""",600
"The four legs, long ears, sensitive nose and temperament are all improvements over the last Earthling we examined.",600
"What’s that, Sport? Timmy’s fallen down a black hole?!",600
"Back to your shithole planet, dog.",600
It seems his name is ‘sit.’,600
"Bear with me, I'm Sirius I have to get to the Dog Star to bury my bone.",600
"Then I get my dinner around 5 PM, relatively speaking.",600
Our research indicates that this is the highest life form on the planet.,600
"Daddy, can we eat... I mean keep him?",600
"Well, sure you can come live on our planet. We value kind, decent, honest life. Doesn’t everyone?",600
"I don't know either. I just heard this guy saying ""Beam me up a Scotty,"" and then this great whooshing sound, and now here I am.",600
"They seem friendly enough, but I was expecting opposable thumbs.",600
And who is going to walk him?,600
I know it's demeaning Johnson but if they ask- you're the good boy.,600
Our initial findings were wrong. There is intelligent life on this planet.,600
"The planet BigBones approaches, Lord Barker.",600
To boldly fetch where no dog has fetched before.,600
"This one is a common species, a rap artist, if I'm not mistaken.",600
"You thought it was just a big frisbee, didn't you boy, didn't you?",600
"We find it to be highly intelligent. It has domesticated a two legged creature to walk with it to clean up after it, and to bring it food.",600
"Ok! Now, we just need peanut butter.",600
Any news of Gérard Depardieu?,600
"Amazing, even their pets wear jewelry!",600
"Breeglot dooot phlom skiegor, Rex?",600
"Bark once for 'I'm really a dog"" and twice for ""It's a transporter screwup.",600
There really is a Dog!,600
Wait. Let me get this straight. The humans kidnapped you from your family and then did what to your genitals?,600
I think he is trying to tell us something.,600
A perfect apparatus for human domination!,600
Inform Commander Laika she has a visitor.,600
He appears to be from the planet K-9.,600
Sometimes those electromagnetic fences just don't work.,600
"Whatcha looking at? I'm just a dog. Ok, so I have a few fleas.",600
We've tried every language in the galaxy and we're no closer to knowing who's a good boy.,600
The earthlings have a very unusual method of greeting each other.,600
"Wow, they sure solved the hair loss problem!",600
Go get help!,600
"We took their best friend, of course they'll surrender.",600
I found him at a stripper bar. He was the only one with his tail on backwards.,600
"Well, you did say ""beam up the smartest thing at the White house"".",600
This was only species that responded to 'STAY!',600
I have deciphered the Best Friend of Human's tail message. He wants to play ball.,600
I stand corrected. There is intelligent life on earth after all.,600
If you ask me it's an antenna of some kind.,600
At last! Intelligent life on Earth.,600
"Stupid computer....I said ""retrieve HER.""",600
"It seems the only thing they can't figure out is ""Who's a good boy?""",600
"Contrary to what we thought, there is intelligent life down there.",600
"It seems to command a sizeable staff of chaperones, cooks, and exercisers, plus free rent and medical care...definitely the planet's alpha.",600
"You learned that men are from Mars, women are from Venus, and cats are from Uranus?",600
Apparently it is their 'best friend',600
ok who's turn is it to put on all the gear and take him out....,600
Earthlings are much more advanced in development than I anticipated.,600
"Good luck, agent Smith. We are confident the humans won’t suspect a thing.",600
"Careful, he probes with his snout.",600
"Well, what do you know? There really is a Dog.",600
This one actually listens.,600
I mentioned a cat scan and he looked at me like i was from outer space,600
He wants us to try the method his species uses to identify each other.,600
This one appears to be broken.,600
Where's the pony?,600
"Who’s the most intelligent life form on your planet? You are, yes you are!",600
Fly me to the moon.,600
Finally...an intelligent life form!,600
"Houston, we have a problem.",600
Your mission is to find Pluto and bring him back.,600
The dog tag says return to Sputnik.,600
He was the smartest one we could find in The White House.,600
What shithole planet are you from?,600
"It looks harmless,but they rule the Earthlings.",600
Pluto!,600
"That's right. Stand at ""Attention"". Good aliens!",600
Cute! Fun! How do earthlings get anything done?,600
Will someone please take this earthling to the poop deck!,600
"In outer space, nobody knows you're a dog.",600
And you say you know where this Dog Park is?,600
I still think that having him along to get us seven times faster in light years is not good science.,600
"We await your orders, Your Eminence.",600
"Our language experts say that wagging the tail is its way of saying ""Take me to your leader.""",600
"Awwww, he wuvs us.",600
That’s not a Scottie.,600
The creature radiates love. It's safe to land.,600
Man’s best friend is the perfect disguise.,600
I love the subtlety of their language.,600
So far our interrogation has determined that he's fluent in two languages - woof and arf!,600
How would you like to visit a world that's not dog-eat-dog?,600
It's settled. We'll keep him.,600
"Dammit Brork, not this kind of rover!",600
Fido: fetch the human.,600
"Normally we'd ask to be taken to your leader, but we've been monitoring your media broadcasts, and I think we'll just stay with you.",600
I thought you said it wouldn't need much attention.,601
"You know how they say that in the Spring, the desert comes alive?",601
We'll lose him in the swimming and biking stages.,601
Something tells me the peyote is staring to kick in.,601
I told you not to water it. Now it's going to follow us home.,601
Looks like we're not the only ones who want out before he builds that wall...,601
"Hon, remember that little cactus we let die on the window sill?",601
Next time just relieve yourself against a rock.,601
"Don't look now, but some prick is following us.",601
"Sorry, we only hug trees.",601
He just wants to say aloe.,601
The operation went well—you’re one tough cookie.,602
We ran a few tests and all the toothpicks came back clean,602
"In our opinion, you won't make it past the holidays.",602
Have you tried icing it?,602
I'm afraid the confection has spread.,602
It's not a ginger fracture. It's worse. It's a ginger snap.,602
I'm not going to sugarcoat this.,602
"I'm afraid, sir, since you were on the floor for more than five seconds, there's nothing we can do for you.",602
He's only known to us as John Dough.,602
Good news: it's just a yeast infection.,602
The results of your biopsy were delicious.,602
We have good news and bad news: You'll be home for Christmas.,602
Eyes still look glazed.,602
"You're fine, but they couldn't save the house.",602
"I’m afraid that IS the way it crumbles, sir.",602
Time to meet your baker.,602
You’re lucky. They usually bite the head off first.,602
"Your color is good, but your sugar level is high.",602
Were you battered as a child?,602
So the good news is we finally got your temperature down from 350 degrees.,602
Go home. Rest. Put some icing on it.,602
Have you tried icing it?,602
"I'm here to take a tissue sample...actually, we'd all like samples.",602
"Yes, thanks to a generous raisin donor, you can see again.",602
Good news. The Pillsbury Dough Boy is a match.,602
The fact that you survived the holidays is a good sign,602
We'd like to keep you here for further tasting.,602
"Look, there's just no way to sugar-coat this...",602
"You are a lucky man, considering that you had a temperature of 350 degrees for eight to ten minutes.",602
It's obviously gingervitis.,602
"Unfortunately, all of our wheelchairs are in use. We do have a dessert cart.",602
I'm afraid he's going to die of consumption.,602
"In case the surgery goes south, we're hoping that you consent to donating your body to the nurses break room.",602
The procedure will cost you an arm and a leg.,602
Prepare to meet your baker.,602
"Sir, you are one tough cookie.",602
It's a miracle that you survived. Your house was totally devoured.,602
"We're discharging you. I suggest that you run, run, as fast as you can.",602
"Your cholesterol and sugar levels are a little high, but you color's good and you smell delicious.",602
"Your sugar is too high, your fats are elevated, and , quite frankly, you’re a day too old.",602
The good news is we have a cure. The bad news is it'll cost you an arm and a leg.,602
"Actually, you're right. Everyone does want a piece of you.",602
"The patient won't tell us his name, so for the moment he's just John Dough.",602
"And tomorrow when you wake up, you'll be a gingerbread woman.",602
We're here to serve you.,602
"On a scale of 1 to 10, how crummy do you feel?",602
Welcome to the Culinary Care Unit.,602
This is the team that put Humpty Dumpty back together again.,602
We were wondering if we could take a few more samples.,602
Congratulations. You're now transginger.,602
"""I'm sorry, did you just say bite me?"".",602
You are one sick cookie.,602
It's a miracle you lasted through the holidays.,602
I'm not going to sugarcoat this.,602
"You'll be able to walk again, but only gingerly.",602
"Despite our best efforts, the confection is spreading.",602
You’d have the option to donate your body to science or to the bake sale.,602
They're here to take samples.,602
So. What's eating you?,602
"On the bright side, none of us thought you'd make it through Christmas.",602
We've decided to keep you here for another 20 minutes at 350 degrees.,602
You are one tough cookie.,602
I've done all I can do. It's time to meet your baker.,602
We're moving you to the cafeteria.,602
We had to remove your raisins.,602
We used to offer enlightenment. Then we discovered people really preferred brunch.,603
The path to true enlightenment is long and arduous. But you may wait at the bar.,603
Only you will truly know when your table is ready.,603
We don't have menus here. Everybody just gets what they deserve.,603
"My son, we all have reservations.",603
"The Meaning of Life? Oh, that's just the name of the restaurant.",603
"I have a one o'clock reservation, last name is Miller but I'm no longer a party of four.",603
Welcome to the Deli Lama.,603
"I know time is meaningless, but there is still a forty minute wait.",603
I can't seat you until you are fully present.,603
"The journey is long, my son, but the wait is even longer.",603
"All who seek enlightenment are welcome, but the restroom is for patrons only.",603
"No my son, you must come without reservations.",603
I can answer all the questions of the universe and all anyone wants to know is the Wi-Fi password.,603
Enlightenment is on Thursdays. Today is Taco Tuesday.,603
"I can validate your existence, but not your parking.",603
"Interesting, you came up this way. Most people use the escalator on the other side...",603
Welcome to the Deli Lama.,603
Words of wisdom? Don't get the chicken salad.,603
I’m sorry we’re a little busy. Maybe try off-peak.,603
They had reservations. You have two more questions.,603
The secret of life is call ahead.,603
"The food's good, but the atmosphere's a little thin.",603
I hope you have a tie in that back pack.,603
Party of oneness?,603
Good luck getting a table. I've been waiting here forever.,603
No Wi-Fi but we have a direct connection to the cloud.,603
We cannot make change for your $20; change comes from within.,603
"Enlightenment wasn't paying the bills, so we added a coffee shop.",603
"We can seat you outside or inside, it doesn’t matter. Nothing matters.",603
"You can come down, he's not the president anymore.",603
"Sorry, we only serve food for thought.",603
"If you want kosher, try that place over on Mt Sinai.",603
Trust me. One day your portrait will be used as the symbol of a political party even more primitive than we are.,604
I know what you're thinking -- don't quit hunting and gathering.,604
"Well, if you want a record of your existence, it’s either this or the tar pits.",604
You should have seen my parents when I told them I didn't want to be a hunter OR a gatherer.,604
"I'm calling it ""The Elephant in the Room""",604
It's SUPPOSED to be primitive!,604
"Don't worry, it's just a cave painting. No one will ever see it.",604
The drawing is the easy part. It's coming up with a caption that's tough.,604
It will be worth more when you're extinct.,604
How do you know it doesn't look like you?,604
"Son, your Mom and I want you back in the picture.",605
"Whatever you do, don’t take the stairs near the Escher painting!",605
The Demoiselles d’Avignon are out to lunch. We’re the McMurrays of Hackensack.,605
Imitating life. What are YOU doing?,605
It's creepy how his eyes are following us.,605
"Well you're no masterpiece yourself, pal.",605
"It says ""Man Looking Stupid"". What does yours say?",605
We kinda got drawn into it.,605
"Due to NEA budget cuts, the painting you would have seen here will be described by my wife, Ethel, her sister, Irene, and myself.",605
"As senior squeegee-man during flight simulations, moving up didn’t pan out.",606
"Yep, we're lost. We passed this guy an hour ago.",606
"He's always had his head in the clouds, but THIS ???",606
"OK, but he is going to have to check that bag.",606
It's the only way Delta lets you redeem their vouchers,606
"While stoned, he mistook a weather balloon for exhaust from a semi.",606
Jack had it all till the beanstalk died.,606
My only regret is that he never got around to visiting your mother.,607
He touched so many lives.,607
"Well, that just leaves taxes.",607
"You know, I can never define irony, but I know it when I see it.",607
I was hoping taxes would go first.,607
"Well, I guess that just leaves taxes.",607
He lived everyday like it was your last.,607
I wonder if he saw himself coming.,607
All they’d say is that it was job-related.,607
I guess we can stop eating kale.,607
I guess his work finally caught up with him.,607
"Well, he has no one to blame but himself for this.",607
I warned him not to run with that thing.,607
"Well, at least he died doing what he loved",607
They did a nice job. He looks grim.,607
"Well, he has no one to blame but himself.",607
I can’t believe Keith Richards outlived him.,607
"Well, that leaves taxes.",607
So where does this leave us on the “till death do us part” thing?,607
Does this mean your mother will be living with us forever?,607
I always hoped that Taxes would be the first to go.,607
Suddenly everyone has only good things to say about him.,607
He died doing what he loved.,607
"Then I said, ""would it kill you to smile now and then?""",607
Amazon puts everyone out of business.,607
To think how many lives he touched.,607
He had so much death left in him.,607
"Well, I guess we can start drinking and smoking again.",607
At least he died doing what he loved.,607
"In spite of everything, he stayed grim right up until the end.",607
I was really hoping Taxes would go first...,607
I hear the new guy has a weed wacker.,607
I guess you can be too good at your job.,607
"And that's when he said, 'Let me handle the N.R.A.'",607
The hard part was transposing from C major to Fahrenheit.,608
It's for when hell freezes over.,608
We need to screen our organ donors more closely.,608
Have you tried banging on it?,608
Is it too hot to Handel?,608
"The last guy played beautifully, but he couldn't handle the pressure.",608
No. I said streaming music.,608
When I get to that part where I talk about Hell turn it all the way up',608
You're right. It has a warmer sound.,608
The hissing is coming from the congregation.,608
Too hot to Handel.,608
"With our budget it was either heat or music, until I had a vision.",608
The man upstairs is complaining.,608
Exactly who did you call to fix the pipes?,608
It's right out of the Old Tenement.,608
All the other organists are going solar.,608
It has a nice warm sound to it,608
He really did appoint Chris Christie as Secretary of Transportation.,609
We can take this and transfer to the BLT at 42nd,609
You rarely see heroes in the subway anymore,609
"Next stop, New Deli.",609
Why does everything look like food when I am on a diet?,609
Let’s wait for the next train. Something’s not kosher with this one.,609
I think we're at the wrong Subway,609
I’m just relieved Subway outbid Trojan.,609
"You realize you’ve just wasted your last wish, don’t you?",609
"Budget cuts, service cuts, now, cold cuts?",609
Let's catch the next one. I hate being sandwiched in.,609
"I don't care, it's on time and we're taking it.",609
Next stop is the Mayo Clinic.,609
It's on time but it's not what I ordered,609
What's next? The gravy train?,609
If it touches the third rail it's toasted,609
Let's wait for the club car.,609
I'm going to need a moment to digest this.,609
It looks packed. Let's wait for the BLT.,609
If it touches the third rail it's toasted,609
They did say it would take a hero to fix the MTA...,609
'Bad news. They found the proof in the pudding.',610
"You can keep calling it ""flambé,"" but out here it's felony arson.",610
They're asking if you prefer gas or electric...,610
Beat until stiff meant the eggs.,610
The good news is they're letting you prepare your last meal.,610
"Cooking meth doesn't make you a chef, Steve.",610
For heaven's sake give them the recipe!,610
"On the bright side, he'll never give you a bad review again.",610
Prepare to serve ten to twenty.,610
"On the bright side, your ""Death by Chocolate"" exceeded expectations.",610
When you said you were going to grill the witness I had no idea.,610
"As White House chef, you must have been expecting this.",610
Good news. I found an attorney specializing in torte law.,610
"As the White House Chef, half the world is hailing you as a hero for at least attempting it.",610
No. I told you “poisson.”,610
"Evidently, the jury found it hard to swallow, too.",610
No one cares that the knife came out clean.,610
It doesn't look good. The butcher and the candlestick maker both took a plea.,610
You didn’t find it suspicious that they were selling oregano by the ounce?,610
They're making you out to be some kind of a butcher.,610
I guess the Times' restaurant critic has more clout than we realized.,610
"We're rebranding. ""Killer Chef"" is out. ""Serving Thyme"" is in.",610
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for that little tart!,610
So who's the chef at Mar-a-lago now?,610
"On the positive side, you're the reason the prison cafeteria now has a Michelin rating.",610
For 30 years at home you never cooked. After two weeks in prison you're the chef?,610
"Everyone else got 12 years, for some reason you got 13.",610
You and I both know salt is the real killer.,610
"Honey, just tell them where you stashed the dough.",610
"When someone orders their steak well done, you have to learn to just let it go.",610
"Oh honey, 'shank' means something very different on the inside.",610
See if you can join the gang Martha Stewart was in,610
Have you decided...gas or electric?,610
Next time - just bake the gay wedding cake.,610
I distinctly said poisson!,610
The good news is you get to prepare your last meal.,610
"You're looking at 20 years, 15 if you use convection.",610
I couldn’t raise the dough.,610
"Believe me, I’ve tested a lot worse things when I was in pharmaceuticals.",611
"If he can be President, I can fly.",611
"""Fine, but for our second date you are coming sewer rafting"".",611
"Okay, just one more time to clarify...statues are worth 5, newly washed cars 25 and investment portfolio managers...125?",611
I don't know Mom. I'm starting to think maybe I was adopted.,611
"So he says “pigeons are just rats with wings.” And I was like, “whoa… Rats. With. Wings.”",611
"Yeah, but I identify as a pigeon.",611
"Dress for the job you want, not the job you have.",611
"So, all I do is land in the park and people toss food at me?",611
It was either this or fly United.,611
"You need good wings to fly; a lot of people don’t know that. I know wings. I’ve got the best wings! No one ever mentions that. No one has better wings, believe me! I’m going to do so much flying you’re going to get tired of seeing me flying!",611
"Well, you don't look like your profile either...",611
Wait... I was adopted?,611
And you poop at the same time?!,611
Either way I’ll be a smash on Broadway.,611
"Oh c'mon, Ratman and Robin. It writes itself!",611
Last question. I am your first student?,611
It's a textbook case--depending on which state your textbooks are from.,612
I suspect some people will deny this ever happened.,612
The coroner said it occurred sometime between 360 million years ago and 4am.,612
"It's Kansas, m'am. Evolution is a crime.",612
I wouldn't have expected this in a million years.,612
"Say what you will, he died a man.",612
This case goes back further than we thought.,612
"Mind you, it's just a theory.",612
Looks like the past finally caught up with him.,612
It's going to take a while to notify all the next of kin.,612
A billion years of evolution and they still don't look both ways...,612
Looks like a textbook case — except in Texas.,612
No jury in Tennessee will believe it.,612
We suspect the cause of death was natural selection.,612
We have to improve our response time.,612
"Well, at least we have a timeline.",612
Witnesses say it all started with a big bang.,612
Just when he got on his own two feet.,612
I'll tell you one thing. This killer took his time.,612
Looks to me like he was running from his past.,612
There's a missing link here somewhere...,612
"Obviously, it's an evolving crime scene.",612
Round up the usual fundamentalists.,612
Get Darwin from forensics on this. He may have a theory.,612
This didn't just happen over night.,612
"We're waiting on the DNA results, but believe they were all related.",612
Looks like his past caught up with him.,612
Looks like the crime took place some time between 600 Million B.C. and 3 A.M.,612
Looks like his past caught up with him.,612
This one has Darwin’s fingerprints all over it!,612
"Clearly, this is an evolving crime scene.",612
I guess we’ll see how this case evolves.,612
I can't help thinking we're missing a link here.,612
"""We've been trying to get a stoplight at this intersection since the beginning of time.'",612
We'll have to notify the next of species,612
"'Yeah, but why kill the other four? No way they were going to talk.'",612
"Well, at least we can rule out the evangelicals.",612
Our witness claims it started with a Big Bang.,612
I estimate time of death somewhere between 10pm last night and the Middle Devonian Period.,612
We think the victims are all related.,612
"Of course, it’s just a theory...",612
We've ruled out an act of God,612
Good luck establishing the time of death.,612
What a shame. He was making real progress.,612
This never happens in the Bible Belt.,612
God only knows what's next.,612
"Start questioning relatives, no matter how distant.",612
The neighbors said they first heard a big bang.,612
"We are authorized to use farce, if necessary.",613
"Unless you want a very long ride in a very small car, I suggest you start talking.",613
"Oh, you'll laugh. They all laugh.",613
Don't make us go for the juggler.,613
"If you think he's a clown, wait until you meet your public defender.",613
I’m going to need you to describe the perp to our balloon artist.,613
“I’m the carrot. He’s the stchick”.,613
"If you want to see a giraffe, we're going to need more a lot more information.",613
"You are in Canada sir. Its good cop, funny cop.",613
Does it look like we're joking?,613
"Johnson, I don't think you understand. I am the good cop.",613
"No, I said to play with more attitude.",614
Your lesson was yesterday.,614
The Zen Way is on the next mountain. This is the Steinway.,614
I know you didn't send for a tuner. The people down in the valley did.,614
The public is saying your latest work is inaccessible.,614
Everyone wants the secret of life. No one asks how the hell I got this baby up here.,614
The Craigslist ad said it's free if I pick it up myself...?,614
"Finally, a request.",614
I'm moving all of my music to the cloud.,614
"To be honest with you, we regret both the promise of free delivery and the promise of lifetime tunings.",614
"The meaning of life? No I don't know it, but maybe if you hum a few bars...",614
Is this the Steinway to Heaven?,614
Well that was a major scale!,614
You find out who your real friends are when you ask them to help you move.,614
"Franz, just call it ""Unfinished"" and come down.",614
With a helicopter. You've got two questions left.,614
"Sorry to tell you this; the divorce is now final, and she got the piano.",614
"I know you're discouraged by the turnout, but I think it's the venue.",614
Am I late for my lesson?,614
"I guess if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.",614
There've been complaints about the hills being alive with the sound of music.,614
I see that no one but you plays at this level.,614
How 'bout this time I show you how to tune the piano yourself?,614
Big deal! Try it with a piano on your back.,614
"I can hear the wife now: ""You caught it, you clean it.""",615
Must be another Trump hotel that's underwater,615
I've finally caught something my wife will let me hang in the living room.,615
"""I hate fishing in the Hamptons"".",615
Too bad it's catch and release. My wife would love this.,615
We must be at Pier 1.,615
You're gonna need a nicer boat.,615
"Finally, something my wife will let me mount in the living room.",615
Those fish are having a ball down there.,615
Now I wish I hadn't thrown back that Chippendale table.,615
It's the Trump lure -- it works best with bottom feeders.,615
Throw it back; we're fishing for mid-century modern.,615
"First, I set the mood.",615
I tie my own. Why do you ask?,615
Is that chandelier going to keep getting bigger every time you tell this story?,615
I'm not surprised. A lot of upscale homes are now underwater.,615
I think I’ll mount this one on the ceiling.,615
I’ve advised my client not to talk.,616
I've got corporate up my ass on this one John...,616
I want to report inappropriate touching.,616
Of course he had a hand in this!,616
I need you to order all of the 'For Dummies' books on this list.,616
"Trust me, I speak for both of us.",616
Do you have any idea who you're talking to?,616
"His words, not mine.",616
We want time-and-a-half.,616
Could you take care of this? The boss is breathing down my neck.,616
The memo speaks for itself. Which is more than I can say for Brad here.,616
Ignore him. You now report directly to me.,616
"Read the memo from HR, Fred. From now on, I'm a ""vocally enabled support mannequin,"" not a ""dummy.""",616
"If he goes, I go.",616
"It's pretty much boilerplate, but if you have questions I'll be in the brown suitcase under Phil's desk.",616
Here's my resignation. I just don't feel like I have a voice here.,616
At least I know I'm a puppet.,616
How do you explain this invoice for a wood chipper?,616
I need to speak with you. Alone.,616
Ancestry.com says your desk is my uncle.,616
The coward behind me. That's who's firing you.,616
I'm his right-hand man.,616
"You aren’t the first person in this bureau to be fired by a dummy, and you won’t be the last!",616
This is the list of grievances from an employee who wishes to remain anonymous.,616
But before we head down... a short fire-safety video...,617
"No, this is Purgatory. Hell has FOX 24/7.",617
I wonder if he moved that pitchfork a little left would we get better reception?,617
"No, purgatory. In hell, it's Fox News 24/7.",617
It gets worse. The commercials are for air conditioning.,617
It's either this or the PBS pledge drive.,617
I didn’t know there would be an orientation video.,617
It's not really eternal - if you watch closely it's a forty-five minute loop.,617
I hear the 1% get real fire...,617
This is boring as hell.,617
"No, only the Catholics have real flames. We’re all Episcopalians.",617
Is it wrong to say you look hot?,617
He wants to make Hell great again.,617
"Good news! If this were hell, they'd be showing Fox News.",617
"This is it? Well, I'll be damned!",617
I guess it didn't really matter if I had on clean underwear after all.,617
"No, you ask him to change the channel.",617
They've been making due with this ever since the place froze over in 2016.,617
"One channel, one show, no remote, welcome to hell!",617
So this is ironic... last week I was standing next to a fire and watching naked people on TV.,617
It's a live feed from the White House.,617
It gets worse. In February they start showing reruns of The Apprentice.,617
Sometimes he changes the channel to Hannity,617
We only get two stations. Fire and Brimstone.,617
"Did you give to the Trump campaign, too?",617
We're all Congressional staff. White House is two circles down.,617
The last thing I remember was accepting a White House appointment.,617
666 channels and nothing is on.,617
"Strangely enough, you are the first person to ask about the clock.",618
Well of course they don’t exist. Now.,618
It’s on the enchanted species list.,618
The damn thing had been leaving rainbows all over my lawn.,618
"Well, sure, but I never would have believed in a Trump presidency, either.",618
"And this is a unicorn, a rare being most don’t even believe exists. Come to think of it, you have a lot in common with him, Black Guy In A New Yorker Cartoon.",618
I figured nobody would believe me so I shot it.,618
Bagged the Emu while on Safari. Bagged the unicorn while on LSD.,618
It's hard to get off a good shot once that carousel gets moving.,618
It was hit or myth.,618
I glued the horn on. I didn't want the grand-kids to know I accidentally shot a horse.,618
Where did you get the clock?,618
"I also have a centaur, but it makes people uncomfortable.",618
"And then, just when I thought he'd gotten away, the carousel circled around again and I got a clean shot.",618
Some say they are extinct. Some don’t believe they ever existed at all. It’s called an “Analog Clock”.,618
Of course I felt bad...I was aiming for the leprechaun.,618
Turns out they're magical but not particularly swift.,618

Skye terrier or Airedale?,623
Can I borrow that?  I’ve got to get a cat out of a tree.,623
I don't think you appreciate the gravity of the situation.,623
"Sir, did you leave a kite at the dog park by any chance?",623
Sticking his head out the car window just doesn't do the trick for him anymore.,623
But my dog IS on a leash,623
He's a bird dog.,623
"Sorry, sir, dog days are in August",623
"No no, it’s let sleeping dogs LIE",623

"Table for two, by the window. Is there a problem?",627
Any dessert before you hit the road?,627
"Ignore the screams, sir. I’ll get you a new fork.",627
Welcome back. The Chef enjoyed reading your pithy critique on Yelp.,627

I recommend starting with an order of wings.,627
"If you find it too drafty, I can close the window.",627
Would you like to hear about our fall specials?,627

May I suggest a little something to take the edge off?,627
Would you care to hear about our tipping policy?,627
"Sorry, after last night, we no longer serve alcohol at this table.",627
The perch is excellent.,627
"Well, the review did describe it as 'urban edgy.'",627
"You reserved a table--and I quote--'away from everyone, with an unobstructed view of the city'.""",627
Is this far enough from the kitchen for sir's liking?,627
The maitre d’ thanks you for the two dollars and hopes you enjoy your meal.,627
I heard today I'm getting canned.,628
Whaddya mean you only serve fish on Friday,628
What the hell else would I drink like?,628
"Just the worm, hold the Tequila.",628
Yeah? Well I'm also a fish out of Scotch.,628
Maybe one day she’ll realize I’m the one that got away.,628
It’s just so hard not to get wrapped up in the news.,628
"I KNOW when something is watered down, pal.",628
'She says she needs room to breathe...what does that even mean?',628
Then one day you wake up and you have ten thousand children and a mortgage that's under water.,628
They sent me to rehab to dry out - damn near killed me,628
Every single school rejected me.,628
And that fisherman had to be 7 or 8 feet tall,628
I hope this isn't a place where people come to hook up.,628
She's sleeping with the fishes. Just not this one.,628
Stop calling me chum!,628
Make it a double. I just got out of the tank.,628
I had a castle and treasure chest before my life went down the toilet.,628
"Leave the tequila, I'll just take the worm.",628
"So then I tell her, ‘Well after two days your mother stinks too.’",628
"Well, what else did you expect me to drink like?",628
Your sign clearly says We serve fish!,628
"Well, I bet you drink like a bald guy",628
"I came here to get a job on Wall Street, but it turns out they only hire sharks and piranhas.",628
You have no idea how hard it is to get a dry martini where I come from.,628
"Sure, but a horse walks into a bar and nobody bats an eye",628
"At this point, I'm more of a fish out of bourbon.",628
I don't know why I can't meet anyone.  I'm quite the catch.,628
Pisces... what’s yours.,628
...And then she gave me this koi smile.,628
"I'm not making this up, she wants us to get a cat.",628
I still like to think of myself as a good catch.,628
"... but TEACH a fish to drink, and he can drink for a lifetime.",628
"If the aquarium calls, I ain't here.",628
"Scotch, neat. And don't tap on the glass.",628
"Yes, but interestingly, I don’t drink like one.",628
"In retrospect, I should have been more specific when I told the genie I wanted to be in a rock group and have women climbing all over me.",629
My therapist said I should try to be a little boulder.,629
What makes this worse is that there is a racket ball court on the other side,629
No matter what I say I end up with a foot in my mouth.,629
Be sure to tell your friends you climbed the face of Everett.,629
Go ahead. Use me to get to the top.,629
"...and then for my third wish I said, 'I want women climbing all over me!'",629
I'm lucky! Most geologists don't find a job in their field right out of college.,629
It's not a career.  It's just a stepping stone.,629
"I was desperate. It was this, or White House press secretary.",629
"For the record, I was opposed to the wall.",629
Gore was right. This is inconvenient.,630
I clearly recall choosing hell over high water.,630
Looks like we might be facing a row vs wade  decision,630
Is your mom still in the lounge chair?,630
"Still want to vote Republican, Ed?",630

Please put your trunks on before the tide goes out!,630
"Frankly, I didn’t believe the seafront would reach Iowa this quickly.",630
"ON the water, Frank. I said a nice place ON the water.",630
It’s Florida. We stand our ground.,630
I'd be worried if we believed in climate change,630
"And to think this was the best table at Mar-a-Lago Club just
5 years ago!",630
"Never mind, I don't need to use the restroom anymore.",630
I’m just saying it might have been helpful to know that the travel agent is your ex-wife.,630
"Thankfully, we've been assured this isn't happening.",630
"Truth is, this is inconvenient.",630
I guess it wasn't fake news.,630
"For all of this talk of global warming, the water is still pretty cold.",630
It's great to get away from the wildfires for a while.,630
"If I had more dough, I'd be in first class.",631
"This way, it's a business trip",631
You can either complain about airline food or do something about it,631
"Ideally, you want the dough to rise to about 35,000 feet.",631
I'd sit in first class if I had enough dough.,631
When we cross the equator it spins the other way.,631
There will be plenty for you. The two people next to me don't have mouths.,631
"Yes, that is a pepperoni in my pocket.",631
It's an emotional support pizza.,631
The trick is adding the water before you go through security.,631
"It's my fault, really. Our coupon didn't specify the delivery area.",631
We deliver.,631
I can do any toppings you want but no more than 3 ounces of sauce.,631
I was told to pack my carry-on with the things I'd knead most.,631
I'm part of Bakers Without Borders. You?,631
I call it New York to Chicago style.,631
"I got her to open up, but now she's beside herself.",632
What makes you think the Russians were involved?,632
They were all in it together.,632
We gotta get the short one to open up.,632
"We’re pretty sure it was an inside inside inside inside inside job, detective.",632
I can’t shake the feeling that they all fit together somehow.,632
I only arrested the one on the left. But when we interrogated her she really opened up.,632
"Well, that would explain just the one set of footprints.",632
We got a tip from someone on the inside.,632
I think the small one is hiding something but I can't get her to open up,632
We're gonna have a hard time proving armed robbery.,632
"Call it a hunch, but I think the little one is at the center of it all.",632
We've already got Number 1 on 5 counts of harboring Russian fugitives.,632
"As we suspected, they were all in on it.",632
You were right about starting with the cavity search.,632
"Nesting, yes. Collusion, no.",632
We couldn't get any more out of them.,632
It’s hard to imagine a more organized crime family.,632
"I suspect it's an inside, inside, inside, inside, inside job.",632
The big one's covering for them.,632
Seriously? Loosen my tie and remove my head?,632
There were more Russians at that meeting than we thought...,632
"If you ask me, I think they were all in on it together.",632
That's the brilliance of it. They all come in on a single visa.,632
"Number 6 will talk, she’s too afraid of going back inside.",632
The judge ordered a short recess.,633
"Sorry, kid, but this is the corporate ladder.",633

Shouldn't you be somewhere staring at a screen?,633
You work here at Google too?,633
It's new for us. We're actually from a swing state.,633
"Wow, Bring Your Parents To School Day is so much more fun than taking you to work",633
Our Boss told us to work on our slide presentation,633
Well the judge said we could take a short recess.,633
"Trust me, kid. Teachers need this more than you do.",633
Our parents never picked us up.,633
"He offered us a franchise, but I think it’s a pyramid scheme.",634
"Finally, hotdogs are at the top of the food pyramid.",634
Of course it’s kosher – who do you think built this place?,634
I think it's safe to assume it contains preservatives.,634
"No, thanks--you never know who goes into those things.",634
We did it. All seven vendors of the ancient world.,634
He must be the only one in the whole Middle East actually making concessions.,634
"Look, It was either this or Pizza Tut",634
No thanks. Those things always get stuck in my sarcophagus.,634
Pretty steep for two hot dogs.,634
Never eat anything with an expiration date ending in BC.,634

No need to panic: a reptile dysfunction is common for men of your age.,651
I usually don't say this to men.....How far apart are the contractions?,651
How do you respond to allegations that you're bipolar?,655
The poles show you’re in trouble.,655
I'm sure voters have noticed that you're completely in the dark half the time.,655
"Ask yourself, are you better off now than you were four billion years ago?",655
I guarantee in twelve hours we'll see a completely different side of my opponent.,655
How do you respond to allegations that you're bipolar?,656
The poles show you’re in trouble.,656
I'm sure voters have noticed that you're completely in the dark half the time.,656
I guarantee in twelve hours we'll see a completely different side of my opponent.,656
"Ask yourself, are you better off now than you were four billion years ago?",656
Do you want to go for L-U-N-C-H and maybe a W-A-L-K?,658
"They're quiet now, but wait until the mail is delivered.",658
"I got a ""You're a good girl. Yes you are"" on my performance review.",658
All I did was pat him on the head and now he's reporting me to HR.,658

"Remember guys , when the prince comes you’re just my sisters kids.",661
"Grouchy, you'll be Press Secretary, Dopey you'll be Attorney General...",661
Don't tell me.  Let me guess. Creepy is behind me.,661
"So, which one of you is ‘Wealthy’?",661
"I would prefer, ""Hello, Snow White"". Not ""Hi, Ho""",661
This shot is for the USC application!  Pretend you know how to skate!,661
I am now Snow Caucasian and you are the seven little persons.,661
OK. 10 more minutes. Then off to work you go.,661
"Yes, they do make you look taller!",661
Did you see the rock he gave her.,662
She's lucky. All the men I date are gatherers.,662
They met at the opera,662
Now I know why she calls him Hun.,662
I hear that they met on a Viking cruise.,662
It's progress. Her first husband was such a Neanderthal.,662
"So, is this your first Minnesota wedding?",662
“It’s about time they settled down and razed a village.”,662
They met clubbing.,662
They're registered at Blood Bath and Beyond.,662
...of course he 'takes' that woman. He's a viking. That's what they do.,662
Who knew there was a black rabbi in Norway?,662
I love that no one wears the pants in their relationship.,662
Kind of encouraging people can still find love in their middle ages.,662
Don’t even think of objecting.,662
He’s made a fortune in hostile takeovers.,662
I’m leaving before she tosses the sword.,662
They met on Ancestry.com.,662
She did describe him as horny.,662
It's a mixed marriage: he's a plunderer and she's a pillager.,662
I give it two harvests.,662
Tonight we’re gonna party like it’s 999.,662
"Next time, when they ask you if you want any toppings, you’d better be more specific than 'Yeah, a couple.'",663
You said you were in the mood for a little Italian.,663
OMG...Remember us...we were on your wedding cake!,663
I don't know either. We asked for a small table on the piazza.,663
You ordered Basil and Olive? Here we are.,663
"Well, you're not what we ordered either.",663
"Hello , we’re the Toppings!",663
Do you mind?  This is a personal pizza.,663
"Finally, some service.",663
Didn't you order the two-person pizza?,663
Would you mind leaving the lid open? We’d prefer to dine outside tonight.,663
Lunch is on me.,665
Dinner's on ME.,665
He’s telling his friends it’s not deep. So be patient.,665
Dinner’s on me tonight.,665
"I didn't know what you were serving, so I brought white.",665
A back massage and then dinner. What's not to like?,665
"Fresh? Sir, I assure you these were walking on land this morning.",665
I brought dinner.,665
It's carryout.,665
It’s like a good wine. You let it breathe before consuming it.,665
Off Coney Island. There's thousands of them.,665
"I’m letting him sunburn a bit more, I prefer extra crispy.",665
Eat a guy and you'll be full. Use him as bait and we'll all be full.,665

He' s my emotional support animal.,665
"When I get hungry, or he realizes I'm not a dolphin, whichever comes first!",665
"If you liked our food delivery service, please give me 5 stars.",665
He’s paying an arm and a leg for the ride.,665
I was told we had to bring our own lunch.,665
I got us a politician. There is no backbone !,665
And I suppose you've never played with your food.,665
Professional courtesy....he’s a lawyer.,665
So we each grab a leg and make a wish.,665
"Last time I ate one this stupid, I was sick for a week.",665
I'm letting him take one last selfie.,665
"Seems only fair ,
I ate his surfboard.",665
"Yes, I KNOW I'm holding up dinner.",665
He's never seen the movie,665
It's part of this whole shore-to-table thing.,665
"Jump up and yell, 'I'm that goldfish you flushed!' 
And then we'll eat him.""",665
You should see the couch they have at the urologist's office.,667
The last place I saw a couch like this also charged by the hour,667
What do uou mean MY oral fixation?,667
Are you going to help me or is this just lip service?,667
Shouldn’t you be sitting in an ear?,667
It just feels like everyone is kissing my ass,667
So this is the famous Freudian's lip.,667
MY oral fixation?!,667
"Oh, and I suppose that sometimes a couch is just a couch.",667
Can you make the tongue do that again?,667
"No, Doc, I said ""tulips"" would make your office more inviting",667
And what couch do you use for anal retentives?,667
It’s much more comfortable since you injected it with collagen.,667
"These lips stay sealed, right?",667
I'm just glad I don't have an anal fixation.,667
Maybe we should try thinking inside the box.,668
"Look, it's right here - ""cheese sold separately""",668
This is the last time I sign up for a research experiment sponsored by Ikea.,668
You're right; it's a trap.,668
Let's just go with the open floor plan.,668
They’re not testing our intelligence. They’re testing our marriage.,668
I think we can build a better one.,668
"If we move the cheese tray to the front, we'll save a lot of  running around later.",668
Now that we ate the cheese I kinda don't see the point.,668
Remind me again how this will prevent us from getting Alzheimer’s.,668
Who writes these instructions...cats?,668
Apparently he expects us to do his entire science project for a piece of cheese.,668
Well this is just great honey.  The directions are written in gerbil.,668
Let’s try thinking inside the box.,668
We're in the control group.  The experimental group doesn't get the instructions,668
Let's just go to live in the box it came in.,668
To heck with this. Let’s go poop in their sock drawer again.,668
I dunno. This feels like a trap.,668
Those Swedish mice think they are so clever,668
"Its mostly hallways and dead ends, but its affordable.",668
"Yes, yes, I mythed you too.",669
"Sorry Puff, but the magic is gone.",669
Give me a minute while I slip into something a little less flammable.,669
